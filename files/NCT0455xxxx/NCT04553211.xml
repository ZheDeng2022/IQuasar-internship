  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HIV epidemic in Peru remains concentrated in the subpopulation of men who have sex with&#xD;
      men (MSM), where the prevalence of disease has been estimated between 10-22% in recent&#xD;
      epidemiologic surveys. Partner-based methods to limit the spread of HIV and STI co-infection,&#xD;
      including partner notification and partner treatment, provide an important new strategy for&#xD;
      HIV control in the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT) has been shown to reduce rates of persistent or recurrent&#xD;
      gonorrhea and chlamydia infection in heterosexual patients, but has not been fully evaluated&#xD;
      for use among men who have sex with men (MSM). CDC guidelines support the use of EPT for&#xD;
      partner management with heterosexual patients, but note the absence of evidence necessary to&#xD;
      make an equivalent recommendation for the use of EPT with MSM. Randomized clinical trials to&#xD;
      assess the impact of EPT on partner notification, treatment, and STI re-infection among MSM&#xD;
      are critical to the development of evidence-based partner management guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a theoretical model, EPT integrates behavioral, social, and biomedical approaches to&#xD;
      HIV/STI control in a comprehensive prevention intervention. Our proposed exploration of the&#xD;
      social and behavioral dimensions of partner notification and treatment will provide a&#xD;
      methodological structure for understanding the influence of EPT on behavioral decision-making&#xD;
      processes, interpersonal factors that influence partner notification, and network patterns of&#xD;
      STI transmission within MSM populations in Peru.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study includes a screening protocol to identify eligible MSM subjects for&#xD;
      participation in our planned study of the effect of EPT on partner notification, treatment,&#xD;
      and linkage to HIV prevention and care services. Potential participants will complete a&#xD;
      behavioral survey and undergo physical examination and testing for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea,&#xD;
      and chlamydia. Participants diagnosed with Gonorrhea and/or Chlamydia (at any anatomic site)&#xD;
      will be eligible for enrollment in our Partner Management study of EPT and the HIV prevention&#xD;
      cascade among MSM in Peru.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Partner Management study will be randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      standard of care partner notification counseling or standard counseling along with a maximum&#xD;
      of five antibiotic treatment packets to deliver to their recent sexual partners. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to return to the site after 21 days to report on their actual partner&#xD;
      notification behavior, with differences in notification evaluated between the two groups.&#xD;
      Participants will then work with a study counselor to identify their recent partners and, if&#xD;
      the participant agrees, to provide contact information so that the study team can contact&#xD;
      these partners. Study staff will either confirm that the partner has already been notified,&#xD;
      or provide notification of their likely STI exposure. After informing partners of their STI&#xD;
      exposure, staff will ask partners to provide verbal consent to a single question evaluation&#xD;
      (whether or not the partner had previously been informed of their exposure) to verify&#xD;
      participant-reported behavior. Partners will also be asked to visit the study site to&#xD;
      complete a brief survey of their sexual practices and treatment-seeking behavior, as well as&#xD;
      to undergo testing for HIV and STIs. All of the above data will be used to construct models&#xD;
      of the spread of HIV and STIs in local MSM networks, and the potential effect of EPT on&#xD;
      controlling the spread of STIs in this population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and Objectives. Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT) provides a framework to integrate&#xD;
      STI control with HIV prevention through the sexual networks of men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (MSM). Partner notification, testing, and treatment are the critical first steps of an HIV&#xD;
      prevention cascade that bridges partner notification with linkage to HIV prevention services&#xD;
      and population-scale reductions in HIV/STI incidence. EPT has been shown effective in&#xD;
      reducing risks for STI re-exposure among heterosexual men and women but remains controversial&#xD;
      for use with MSM. Previous studies of EPT with heterosexual couples have demonstrated&#xD;
      significant decreases in the risk of recurrence for gonorrhea (GC), chlamydia (CT) and other&#xD;
      STIs. Objections to the use of EPT with MSM center on the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV and&#xD;
      syphilis among their partners, and fears that providing access to antibiotics will discourage&#xD;
      STI-exposed individuals from seeking additional treatment. However, the evidence-based&#xD;
      foundation for these objections is limited. In our study of EPT for MSM with GC/CT in Peru,&#xD;
      the odds of partner notification were significantly greater in the EPT arm (85.2%) than in&#xD;
      the standard counseling arm (61.8%; OR=3.56). Additional research is needed to explore the&#xD;
      use of EPT in MSM partnerships and to develop alternative conceptual frameworks capable of&#xD;
      understanding the complex associations between EPT, STI control, and HIV prevention in MSM&#xD;
      sexual networks. We hypothesize that EPT will increase the frequency of partner notification,&#xD;
      encourage partners to seek HIV/STI counseling and testing, and promote linkage to HIV&#xD;
      prevention and treatment services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in partnership formations and network structures of MSM necessitate&#xD;
      correspondingly specific approaches to partner management. Heterosexual networks in previous&#xD;
      partner therapy trials included a high frequency of stable or monogamous partnerships where&#xD;
      HIV/STI risk could be localized and confined. In one study, the mean number of sexual&#xD;
      partners in 3 months reported by men and women with GC/CT was 1.5. In another, 96% of women&#xD;
      with CT named &lt;2 recent partners, and most reported one. In these partnership contexts, EPT&#xD;
      offers a simple method to control cyclical STI transmission in 2-core or 3-core networks of&#xD;
      stable, recurrent sexual contacts. In contrast, sexual partnerships between MSM in the U.S.&#xD;
      and Latin America are often part of large networks characterized by a diverse, concurrent mix&#xD;
      of stable, casual, and anonymous partners. In a 2014 survey, MSM in Peru reported an average&#xD;
      of 4.2 partners in the previous 30 days. The open structure of these decentralized, k-core&#xD;
      networks limits the effectiveness of patient-delivered partner therapy in controlling&#xD;
      cyclical STI re-transmission between stable partners. Instead, the primary benefit of EPT in&#xD;
      these open-circuit networks lies in the potential to target HIV/STI prevention technologies&#xD;
      to the highest risk nodes of diffuse and diverse sexual networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPT offers an intervention ideally suited to Peru's local epidemiologic context. The Peruvian&#xD;
      HIV epidemic is concentrated in the population of MSM and transgender women (TW) and&#xD;
      associated with STI co-infection. In high-risk MSM populations, partner- and network-level&#xD;
      characteristics have been found to be important factors contributing to HIV/STI acquisition.&#xD;
      Sexual networks of at-risk MSM are often composed of a concurrent mix of stable/primary,&#xD;
      casual (recurrent or single contact), anonymous, and/or commercial partners, with varying&#xD;
      degrees of communication, trust, and responsibility. Although stable partners are considered&#xD;
      &quot;low-risk&quot; for exposure to HIV/STIs, the lack of objective information on HIV/STI status and&#xD;
      the increased likelihood of condomless intercourse in these partnership contexts lead to a&#xD;
      high frequency of HIV/STI transmission. Casual sexual partners are often maintained&#xD;
      concurrent with primary partners or anonymous contacts and contribute to the dissemination of&#xD;
      HIV/STIs across diffuse social and geographic boundaries. Anonymous partners, by definition&#xD;
      untraceable, are common and present significant challenges for STI control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has emphasized how interpersonal contexts influence partner management&#xD;
      tools. Internet systems encourage notification in casual partnerships with minimal&#xD;
      interpersonal commitment and low perceived risk of re-exposure, while efforts to target&#xD;
      prevention outreach to the dates and times of anonymous contacts have shown success. In&#xD;
      contrast, EPT is most effective in stable or recurrent casual partnerships where trust and&#xD;
      communication are assumed and the potential for STI re-exposure is high. While any&#xD;
      comprehensive partner management strategy will require an array of systems to address the&#xD;
      range of partnerships structuring MSM networks, EPT provides a critical tool to address&#xD;
      HIV/STI transmission networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the potential effectiveness of EPT for use with MSM, the investigators have&#xD;
      identified three key questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) What is the effect of EPT on self-reported behavioral notification practices and&#xD;
      biological outcomes of recurrent GC/CT infection? ii) What is the effect of EPT on&#xD;
      partner-confirmed notification outcomes, HIV/STI testing, and linkage to prevention/treatment&#xD;
      services? and iii) Would observed increases in testing and treatment lead to reductions in&#xD;
      population-level patterns of HIV/STI transmission?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Aim 1. To determine the effect of EPT on individual-level outcomes of partner&#xD;
      notification and persistent or recurrent GC/CT infection among MSM. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      recruit 2,208 behaviorally high-risk MSM from community-based HIV/STI testing sites to&#xD;
      undergo nucleic acid testing for rectal, pharyngeal, and urethral GC/CT in order to identify&#xD;
      552 GC/CT-positive cases. Cases will be randomly assigned to receive standardized partner&#xD;
      notification counseling, either alone or in combination with EPT (antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      packets to deliver to their recent partners). Self-reported partner notification, associated&#xD;
      factors including empowerment, stigma/ shame, barriers to partner testing/treatment, and&#xD;
      prevalence of persistent or recurrent GC/CT will be compared between intervention and control&#xD;
      arms at 21-Day Follow-up. To collect longitudinal data on post-intervention risk behavior and&#xD;
      HIV/STI incidence, enrolled participants will be asked to return for quarterly HIV/STI&#xD;
      testing over a 12-month period. Recurrent GC/CT cases will be managed according to the&#xD;
      original randomization arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To assess the effect of EPT on partner-confirmed outcomes of notification, HIV/STI&#xD;
      testing, STI treatment, and linkage to HIV prevention and treatment services. After&#xD;
      completing the 21-Day Follow-up evaluation, participants will be asked to provide partner&#xD;
      contact information for study staff to confirm participant-reported outcomes. Assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted by telephone, and partners will be asked to visit the site for HIV,&#xD;
      syphilis, and GC/CT testing and to complete a brief survey of their post-notification&#xD;
      behavior, including subsequent HIV/STI testing, STI treatment, and uptake of HIV prevention&#xD;
      and treatment services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To model the impact of EPT for partners of MSM on network- and community-level&#xD;
      patterns of HIV and STI transmission. Empiric data from Aims 1 and 2, supplemented by data&#xD;
      from published literature, will be used to construct Agent-Based Models estimating the effect&#xD;
      of observed individual- and partner-level outcomes on projected population-level HIV/STI&#xD;
      transmission. Empiric data on the effect of EPT on prevention cascade outcomes of partner&#xD;
      notification, HIV/STI testing, antibiotic treatment, and uptake of biomedical prevention&#xD;
      methods like PrEP and TasP, and subsequent observations of GC/CT prevalence and incidence, as&#xD;
      well as cohort patterns of HIV and STI acquisition, re-infection, and co-transmission will&#xD;
      all be collected. These data points will be used to inform population-scale models comparing&#xD;
      HIV incidence in the intervention and control arms and to assess the community-level impact&#xD;
      of EPT on STI control and HIV prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methods Overview. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to assess the effect of Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT) on self-reported partner&#xD;
      notification and recurrent GC/CT infection among MSM with GC/CT (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on prior studies among MSM in Peru where GC/CT prevalence was 30-40%, the investigators&#xD;
      anticipate screening 2,208 men to recruit a cohort of 552 GC/CT-infected MSM [101, 128, 129].&#xD;
      Screening procedures will include assessment of demographic and behavioral characteristics,&#xD;
      and HIV, syphilis, and GC/CT testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Screening. Screening procedures will assess for eligibility and obtain baseline HIV/STI&#xD;
      prevalence data for the population. In order to assess for HIV acquisition and transmission&#xD;
      risk, and to map mixing patterns by HIV status within sexual networks, both HIV-infected and&#xD;
      -uninfected MSM will be eligible. Due to significant differences in partnership structures,&#xD;
      interactions, and notification practices between MSM and transgender women (TW), only MSM&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Screening will continue until enrolling 552 GC/CT-infected MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Behavioral Survey: All screened participants will be asked to complete an ACASI survey&#xD;
      assessing demographics, substance use, history of HIV/STI testing, use of PrEP (if&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected) or antiretroviral therapy (if HIV-infected), sexual practices,&#xD;
      characteristics of recent partners, and sexual network composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Rapid HIV Testing: Study staff will provide pre- and post-test HIV risk reduction&#xD;
      counseling based on the CDC's RESPECT-2 model and screen for HIV with a 4th Generation Rapid&#xD;
      HIV-1/2 assay (Alere Determine, Alere) [130]. Participants with a positive rapid test will be&#xD;
      informed of their results and a blood sample will be sent for confirmatory Western Blot&#xD;
      testing. Referrals to HIV prevention and treatment services (including PrEP and ART) offered&#xD;
      at Via Libre and other local sites will be provided according to the participant's&#xD;
      serostatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Viral Load Testing. In order to assess the burden of HIV viremia (and risks for&#xD;
      secondary HIV transmission) in the population, samples for HIV-1 PCR testing will be&#xD;
      collected from all HIV-infected participants at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Physical Examination: Participants will undergo routine physical examination to assess&#xD;
      for signs of untreated STIs. Participants with primary or secondary syphilis or with a known&#xD;
      exposure to syphilis, will be treated with Benzathine Penicillin G 2.4 million IU (or, if&#xD;
      allergic to Penicillin, with Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID x 7 days). Participants with urethral&#xD;
      and/or rectal discharge or inflammation will be treated with Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM and&#xD;
      Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID x 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) Syphilis Testing: Participants will undergo syphilis testing by RPR (RPRnosticon,&#xD;
      Biomerieux), with positive results confirmed by TPPA (Serodia TPPA, Fujirebio) and serial&#xD;
      dilution of positive titers. Individuals with latent syphilis diagnosed by laboratory testing&#xD;
      will be treated with three weekly IM doses of Penicillin G or a 21 day course of oral&#xD;
      Doxycycline (100 mg PO BID), if allergic to Penicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi) GC/CT Nucleic Acid Testing: All participants will be tested for pharyngeal, rectal, and&#xD;
      urethral GC/CT. First-catch urine samples will be self-collected by participants. Pharyngeal&#xD;
      and rectal swabs will be obtained by clinical staff. (Participants will also be allowed to&#xD;
      self collect rectal swab samples, if preferred.) Samples will be tested for GC/CT using a&#xD;
      transcription mediated assay (TMA) (GenProbe Aptima, Hologic). Results of laboratory testing&#xD;
      will be provided within 14 days at a scheduled Follow-up visit. Participants with&#xD;
      asymptomatic GC/CT will be provided with appropriate antibiotic treatment (Ceftriaxone 250 mg&#xD;
      IM and Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID x 7 days for GC or GC/CT co-infection; Doxycycline 100 mg PO&#xD;
      BID x 7 days for CT mono-infection). While no specific follow-up testing will be performed,&#xD;
      all participants will be encouraged to seek routine STI screening in 3-6 months, according to&#xD;
      their sexual risk behavior. Study protocols for antibiotic treatment and follow-up testing&#xD;
      are consistent with the US CDC 2015 Recommendations for STI Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vii) Follow-up Visit: All participants will be asked to return for a Follow-up visit within&#xD;
      14 days to receive results of laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      viii) Enrollment: Participants with symptomatic urethritis/proctitis at the Initial Visit or&#xD;
      with laboratory diagnosed GC/CT infection (at any anatomic site) at the Follow-up visit will&#xD;
      be eligible for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vii) Randomization: Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to intervention and&#xD;
      control arms on a 1-to-1 basis. Assignments will be generated through the site www.random.org&#xD;
      in random permuted blocks of 5. Assignments will be stored in sealed envelopes to be opened&#xD;
      and recorded at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      viii) Anticipated Partner Notification Survey: After randomization, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a survey assessing partner notification attitudes, beliefs, and anticipated&#xD;
      practices. The survey instrument has been developed from our previous work with MSM in Peru&#xD;
      and addresses behavioral, biological, and social factors associated with notification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Behavioral Factors: Introductory questions address behavioral, normative, and control&#xD;
           beliefs associated with PN and are based on previous qualitative research with MSM in&#xD;
           Peru. Previously developed and validated scales addressing STI stigma and shame, partner&#xD;
           notification and condom use self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, and substance use will&#xD;
           provide information on behavioral contexts of notification decisions. A Spanish version&#xD;
           of the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale will be used to assess for response&#xD;
           bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biomedical Factors: Biological characteristics of the individual, the pathogen, and the&#xD;
           partnership will be used to evaluate for presence or absence of symptoms, perceived&#xD;
           risks of having infected (or been infected by) a given partner, and risk of secondary&#xD;
           HIV/STI transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Social Factors: Sexual network characteristics, including the gender and sexual identity&#xD;
           of the participant and their recent partner(s), partnership type, and partner-specific&#xD;
           risk behavior will be assessed. Survey questions ask about participants' sexual behavior&#xD;
           (including condomless insertive and receptive anal intercourse with serodiscordant or&#xD;
           unknown status partners), and substance use. To assess partner-specific factors,&#xD;
           participants will be asked to described characteristics of their three most recent&#xD;
           sexual contacts, sexual practices with these partners, anticipated likelihood of&#xD;
           notifying each partner, and incentives or barriers to notification. In order to assist&#xD;
           with future recall, participants will be asked to provide a name, nickname, or&#xD;
           identifying characteristic (e.g., &quot;The guy in the blue shirt from Vale Todo&quot;) for each&#xD;
           of these partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ix) Partner Notification Counseling: All participants will be provided with partner&#xD;
      notification counseling using a standardized script. The scripted message will advise the&#xD;
      recipient of the importance of informing recent sexual partners of their diagnosis, and the&#xD;
      availability of free partner testing at the Via Libre site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      x) Expedited Partner Therapy: Participants assigned to the EPT arm will also be provided with&#xD;
      a maximum of 5 EPT partner treatment packets. The number of packets is limited in order to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of diversion or inappropriate use of antibiotics while still providing&#xD;
      reasonable partner access to treatment. Each packet will contain single doses of Cefixime&#xD;
      (400 mg) and Azithromycin (1g), as well as Spanish-language printed information on GC/CT&#xD;
      infection and local sites offering free or low-cost HIV/STI testing and treatment (including&#xD;
      Via Libre). (Cefixime is recommended by the CDC as an oral treatment option for GC infection&#xD;
      in situations where use of injectable ceftriaxone is not feasible, for instance in cases of&#xD;
      partner-delivered antibiotic therapy.) Printed information will include a message advising&#xD;
      the recipient that they are at high risk of exposure to HIV, syphilis, and GC/CT, that they&#xD;
      should seek HIV/STI testing and treatment at a local health care facility, and that they&#xD;
      should only take the antibiotics provided if they are unable or unwilling to seek appropriate&#xD;
      care. Participants will be counseled by study staff on the proper use and distribution of&#xD;
      partner treatment packets using a pre-scripted message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      xi) 21-Day Follow-Up Assessment: 21 days after diagnosis, participants with GC/CT infection&#xD;
      will be asked to return to the clinic for a Follow-up Visit including survey assessment of&#xD;
      partner notification and treatment outcomes and biological test of cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Outcomes Survey. Participants will be asked to complete an ACASI Partner&#xD;
      Notification Outcomes survey. Participants will be reminded of the number of recent sexual&#xD;
      partners they reported on the Enrollment Survey and asked to describe both how many of these&#xD;
      partners were notified of their GC/CT diagnosis and how many partners were provided with EPT&#xD;
      treatment packets (if applicable). Participants will be reminded of the basic characteristics&#xD;
      of their 3 most recent sexual partners (gender, sexual identity, and first name or other&#xD;
      label used to identify the partner) and asked to state whether each of these partners was&#xD;
      notified, whether they received antibiotic therapy (either from the participant or from a&#xD;
      different source), whether they received testing for HIV and other STIs, and why each partner&#xD;
      was or was not informed of their STI exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological Test of Cure. Repeat TMA testing for GC/CT infection will be conducted only at the&#xD;
      site of the initial GC/CT infection, with results provided by phone or in person within 14&#xD;
      days. Participants with persistent or recurrent infection will be provided with an additional&#xD;
      course of antibiotic therapy. Confirmation of Notification. After completing Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments, counselors will interview participants to review partner notification outcomes&#xD;
      and to request partner contact information to confirm reported outcomes. Procedures for&#xD;
      participant interviewing and partner contact are described below (Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Quarterly Monitoring Visits. i. Monitoring Procedures. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      return to the study site every three months (starting from the date of their initial&#xD;
      Screening Visit) over a 12-month period for repeat HIV/STI testing and re-assessment of&#xD;
      sexual behavior and network patterns. Participants will be asked to complete a brief,&#xD;
      ACASI-administered survey at each visit. Similar to the Baseline survey, the Monitoring&#xD;
      questionnaire will assess sexual risk behavior, substance use, sexual partnerships, and&#xD;
      sexual network characteristics during the previous 3-month interval. Participants will also&#xD;
      undergo physical examination for signs or symptoms of STIs following the procedures outlined&#xD;
      above. Rapid HIV and syphilis testing will be performed at each visit using the procedures&#xD;
      outlined above. Repeat testing for pharyngeal, rectal, and urethral GC/CT infection will be&#xD;
      performed at each visit with results provided by telephone or in person within 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Repeat Episodes of GC/CT. Recurrent cases of GC/CT infection will be managed according to&#xD;
      the procedures listed above. Participants diagnosed with recurrent GC/CT will be asked to&#xD;
      come to the clinic site for treatment with Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM and/or Doxycycline 100 mg PO&#xD;
      BID for 7 days. Partner management procedures will be delivered according to the original&#xD;
      randomization assignment. Participants in the Control arm will receive standardized Partner&#xD;
      Notification counseling as described above. Participants assigned to the EPT arm will be&#xD;
      provided with an additional set of 5 partner treatment packets. Participants in both arms&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the Anticipated Partner Notification Survey as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Follow-Up Assessment: Participants with recurrent GC/CT will be asked to return for&#xD;
      additional 21-Day Follow-Up Assessment(s). At the Follow-up visit, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete the Partner Notification Outcomes survey, to undergo test of cure for GC/CT, and&#xD;
      to provide partner contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Aim 2 will focus on partner confirmation of notification and treatment outcomes, and&#xD;
      biological assessment of partner HIV/STI status. After completing 21-Day Follow-up&#xD;
      procedures, participants will be asked for permission to contact their recent sexual partners&#xD;
      in order for study staff to confirm reported notification outcomes (or to advise uninformed&#xD;
      partners of their exposure). Counselors will attempt to contact recent partners by telephone,&#xD;
      inform them of their STI exposure, and ask them to visit the study site for a single visit&#xD;
      including HIV/STI testing, completion of a behavioral survey, and appropriate antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Contact Tracing. After completing the 21-Day Follow-up assessment, participants with GC/CT&#xD;
      will undergo a partner notification interview with study staff. Counseling sessions will draw&#xD;
      on established practices for partner recall in STI interviewing, in accordance with Peruvian&#xD;
      Ministry of Health guidelines. Assessments will use Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) methods to&#xD;
      generate a detailed accounting of all sexual partners during the 60-day period prior to&#xD;
      diagnosis. Counselors will work with participants to enumerate their total number of sexual&#xD;
      partners, identify all named partners, and elicit available contact information. Although&#xD;
      participants will be advised that notification will be conducted anonymously, without&#xD;
      revealing their name or other identifying characteristics, the possibility of partner&#xD;
      violence or other negative responses to notification will be discussed. Participants will be&#xD;
      given the option to decline to provide contact information for any partner(s) they do not&#xD;
      wish to inform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Partner Notification and Telephone Survey. Counselors will attempt to contact named&#xD;
      partners by telephone to inform them of their exposure to GC/CT, to discuss the importance of&#xD;
      HIV/STI testing, and to advise them of the availability of free testing at the study site.&#xD;
      After answering any questions, counselors will ask for consent to conduct a brief telephone&#xD;
      survey. If agreed, the counselor will administer a 5-question survey of whether the partner&#xD;
      had been notified of their STI exposure, how they were notified and/or who notified them), if&#xD;
      they received antibiotic treatment, how they received the treatment, and whether they sought&#xD;
      HIV/STI testing. Partners will be invited to the study site for HIV/STI testing and&#xD;
      additional study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Partner Clinic Assessment. Partners who visit the study site will participate in a&#xD;
      single-session evaluation of notification and treatment outcomes. Partners will be asked to&#xD;
      complete an ACASI survey describing their demographic information, sexual behavior, HIV/STI&#xD;
      history, number and type of all recent sexual partners, and characteristics of their three&#xD;
      most recent sexual partners. After completing the survey, partners will be examined for signs&#xD;
      or STIs and tested for HIV, syphilis, and GC/CT using the procedures described above. Viral&#xD;
      load testing will be performed for partners with new or previously diagnosed HIV infection.&#xD;
      Results of laboratory testing will be provided within 14 days. Appropriate antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment and/or referrals for HIV prevention and treatment services will be provided to all&#xD;
      partners based on HIV/STI status as described above.&#xD;
