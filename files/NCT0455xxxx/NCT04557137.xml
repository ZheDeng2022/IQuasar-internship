      Numerous studies describe HRQoL in other cancer types, whereas only sparse research has been&#xD;
      done in NEN patients. We wish to investigate HRQol in NEN patients. Using a validated generic&#xD;
      tool with normative values derived from a background population, allows us to compare the&#xD;
      values healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional study that investigates 250 patients (Cohort A) with neuroendocrine&#xD;
      neoplasia, encompassing both patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and neuroendocrine&#xD;
      carcinomas (NEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study that investigates 30 newly diagnosed NET patients over three months&#xD;
      (Cohort B) who are offered palliative treatment with somatostatin analogues.&#xD;

      The diagnosis of cancer and living with cancer has an impact on patients' HRQoL. Numerous&#xD;
      studies describe HRQoL in other cancer types, whereas only sparse research has been done in&#xD;
      NEN patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies concerning the effect of cancer on HRQoL have been useful and help&#xD;
      clinicians regulate treatment regimens in other cancer types. In advanced cancer patients, it&#xD;
      is shown that Global QoL, physical, role, and emotional functioning improves during HPN and&#xD;
      it wasin patients who are candidates for HPN according to the European guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, patients with laryngeal cancer who are offered partial or total laryngectomy&#xD;
      experience a significant and fast decline in HRQoL compared to those who are offered&#xD;
      transoral laser microsurgery. This study has improved clinician and patient decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies investigating HRQoL in NEN patients have methodological limitations; no&#xD;
      reference groups, limited number of patients or including a heterogenos group of patietns.&#xD;
      This lack of methodological quality may explain the inconsistency in the HRQoL results found&#xD;
      in previous NEN studies.To our knowledge, only a few cross-sectional studies of larger&#xD;
      patient groups compared to a background population have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both HRQoL and fatigue are likely to be affected in NEN patients. Using a validated generic&#xD;
      tool with normative values derived from a background population, allows us to compare the&#xD;
      values healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify HRQoL and fatigue in a cross-sectional study (Study A) of a large group of&#xD;
           patients with NEN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the immediate effect of diagnosis and somatostatin-analogue treatment on&#xD;
           new patients. A prospective study over the course of three months (Study B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the change in HRQoL and fatigue during follow-up. (a three year follow-up&#xD;
           will be performed beyond this research year)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRQoL will be significantly lower and fatigue significantly higher in NEN patients&#xD;
           compared to the general population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRQoL will be significantly lower and fatigue significantly higher in NEC patients&#xD;
           compared to NET patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newly diagnosed patients with NET starting somatostatin analogue treatment will improve&#xD;
           their HRQoL and reduce fatigue after a follow-up period of three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with neuroendocrine neoplasia, HRQoL will remain unchanged in patients with&#xD;
           stable disease and derease in patients with disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional study that investigates 250 patients (Cohort A) with neuroendocrine&#xD;
      neoplasia, encompassing both patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and neuroendocrine&#xD;
      carcinomas (NEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study that investigates 30 newly diagnosed NET patients over three months&#xD;
      (Cohort B) who are offered palliative treatment with somatostatin analogues.&#xD;
