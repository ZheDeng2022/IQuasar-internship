    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of two different high intensity interval&#xD;
      training (HIIT) prescription approaches on improving fitness, heart function, and the ability&#xD;
      of the body's muscles to receive oxygen.&#xD;

    <description>Individual exercise training sessions, involving two weeks of moderate intensity continuous exercise and 10 weeks of interval exercise training. This protocol involves progression of training of 3 stages: 1) six high-intensity intervals (at an RPE of 15-18) of 1-min separated by five low-intensity intervals of 2-min; 2) three high-intensity intervals of 2-min separated by two low-intensity intervals of 4-min, and a further 2-min of low intensity following the last interval before cool-down; and 3) three high-intensity intervals of 3-min separated by two low-intensity intervals of 3-min, and a further 1-min of low intensity following last interval before cool-down.</description>
