    <textblock>
      The clinical study is aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of erythropheresis in high&#xD;
      altitude polycythemia. People reside in highland diagnosed as high-altitude polycythemia were&#xD;
      included and randomly divided into two groups. In one group, routine therapy including oxygen&#xD;
      inspiration would be performed, while in another erythropheresis would be added. Symptom&#xD;
      relief, blood oxygenation, and 6-minute walk test would be assessed and compared in the above&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;

    <measure>Arterial partial pressure of oxygen</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after treatment is completed</time_frame>
    <description>The partial pressure of oxygen, is a measurement of oxygen pressure in arterial blood. It reflects how well oxygen is able to move from the lungs to the blood.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activated partial thromboplastin time</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after treatment is completed and during follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>A screening test to evaluate the overall integrity of the intrinsic/common coagulation pathway. This test reflects the activities of most of the coagulation factors in the intrinsic and common procoagulant pathway, but not the extrinsic procoagulant pathway, which includes factor VII and tissue factor, nor the activity of factor XIII.</description>

    <measure>Prothrombin time</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after treatment is completed and during follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>A test to measure how long it takes for your blood plasma to clot.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen saturation Oxygen saturation</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after treatment is completed and during follow-up period</time_frame>
