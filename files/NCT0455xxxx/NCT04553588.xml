      The purpose of the study is to determine if opioid disposal bags/pouches are an effective&#xD;
      method for disposing of unused opioid medications postoperatively&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are dispensed regularly to manage postoperative pain in patients undergoing surgery&#xD;
      in hospitals and same day surgery centers. There has been a rise in the number of opioid&#xD;
      misuse and overdoses nationally, with Ohio ranked first in the nation for drug overdose&#xD;
      deaths in 2014 and Cuyahoga County leading the state with 666 overdose deaths in 2016(ref) As&#xD;
      health care providers, it is our responsibility to respond to this epidemic. One measure to&#xD;
      address this is to reduce the number of unused prescription opioids that remain in patients'&#xD;
      possession when they no longer need them. (ref) Doing so will maximize safety by decreasing&#xD;
      the availability of unused opioids. The purpose of this study is to determine if a product&#xD;
      that deactivates opioids will be used as designed after oral opioid medication is no longer&#xD;
      needed. The design of this study is a quality initiative project using a randomized control&#xD;
      design. The setting is a surgery center in a suburban hospital in Cuyahoga County. The&#xD;
      population is all adult surgery center patients that are prescribed opioids postoperatively&#xD;
      who are discharged the same day. In addition to usual care, a medication disposal bag with&#xD;
      instructions on how to use will be given to the patient prior to discharge. The patient will&#xD;
      be called 30-45 days post discharge. The data will be collected on a case report form that&#xD;
      will include information about disposal and information obtained from the patients medical&#xD;
      record.&#xD;
