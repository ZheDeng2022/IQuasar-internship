    <textblock>
      An uncontrolled pilot in which Veterans age 60-95 years with chronic musculoskeletal (MSK)&#xD;
      pain will undergo Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) delivered over video&#xD;
      teleconference (VTC; together vEAET). This study aims to obtain early implementation&#xD;
      outcomes, as well as evaluate efficacy and estimated effect sizes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this pilot, vEAET will be provided to outpatient Veterans age 60-95 years with chronic&#xD;
      MSK pain in order to obtain early implementation and clinical outcomes (i.e. acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility, appropriateness, fidelity, and effectiveness). Each Veteran will be provided a&#xD;
      VTC capable tablet and technological support from a research coordinator as a strategy to&#xD;
      overcome technology based obstacles and obtain feasibility data. Veterans will receive one&#xD;
      90-minute individual session of vEAET plus eight 90-minute weekly group sessions of vEAET,&#xD;
      all delivered over VTC to their homes. Assessments will be performed at baseline,&#xD;
      posttreatment, and 2-month follow-up remotely using OutcomeMD (Los Angeles, CA), a&#xD;
      HIPAA-compliant, VA-approved web-based platform. The entire study will be performed without&#xD;
      any in-person visits.&#xD;
