    <textblock>
      The current study addresses the gap in equity in mental health education for adolescents of&#xD;
      color in South Los Angeles. Particularly, the focus is on developing, testing and evaluating&#xD;
      the feasibility and youth responsiveness of a curriculum reflecting the main&#xD;
      principles/concepts of the framework of &quot;Youth Participatory Action Research&quot; and general&#xD;
      mental health outcomes for adolescents living in a context of poverty and significant&#xD;
      inequities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to effectively prevent mental distress and promote well-being for youth of color in&#xD;
      urban contexts with significant health inequities and mental health stigma, more innovative&#xD;
      and participatory models are critical. Youth participatory action research (YPAR), is a&#xD;
      framework outlining engagement of youth with researchers more equitably as co-constructors of&#xD;
      knowledge and promoting positive development of core competencies in youth to foster their&#xD;
      growth as change agents. YPAR is especially valuable for youth of color, to build&#xD;
      competencies (e.g., critical consciousness, research and advocacy skills) critical for&#xD;
      tackling health inequities and systems change. The proposed study will be conducted in&#xD;
      partnership with the Community Healing and Trauma Prevention Center (CHTPC), a community&#xD;
      grass roots organization of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, charged with&#xD;
      designing educational and creative spaces for prevention and healing of trauma in the&#xD;
      community, with youth positive development as one of its key priorities. Guided by YPAR, this&#xD;
      mixed-method, pre-post evaluation study will develop a YPAR-Mental Health (MH) curriculum and&#xD;
      evaluate its feasibility, youth responsiveness, and association with positive youth&#xD;
      developmental outcomes related to YPAR and mental health with youth of color (ages 14-17)&#xD;
      from high schools in South Los Angeles (SPA-6). The study will comprise two phases: Phase 1 -&#xD;
      Development and Refinement of YPAR-MH Curriculum, and Phase 2 - Pilot Testing, Implementation&#xD;
      and Evaluation of YPAR-MH Curriculum. During phase 1, a team of the PI, CDU graduate&#xD;
      students, King/Drew Magnet High School students, and CHTPC staff will develop the curriculum.&#xD;
      Input for refinement of the curriculum will be offered by a team of youth experts, including:&#xD;
      a) community youth advocates, b) clinical psychologist with youth mental health expertise,&#xD;
      and c) community psychologist with YPAR expertise. A set of four focus groups will be&#xD;
      conducted with youth (4-6 youth per focus group, 14-17 years of age) to further improve the&#xD;
      curriculum to assure &quot;youth responsiveness&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phase 2, a total of 20 youth will participate in the pilot testing of the YPAR-MH&#xD;
      curriculum. After further refining the curriculum given lessons learned from the pilot&#xD;
      testing, a total of 50 youth will participate in the finalized curriculum implementation. A&#xD;
      pre-post curriculum survey will be conducted for all youth. Additionally, a set of four focus&#xD;
      groups with youth participating in the finalized curriculum will be conducted to evaluate&#xD;
      their qualitative experiences, satisfaction with curriculum, and learning of curriculum&#xD;
      material. There are two specific aims, objectives and hypotheses which will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To develop and refine a YPAR-MH curriculum, guided by youth community,&#xD;
      research, and clinical experts. Four focus groups will be conducted with a maximum total of&#xD;
      24 youth to assess the youth responsiveness of the curriculum. A qualitative thematic&#xD;
      analysis of the focus group data will be conducted and the findings will be used to further&#xD;
      refine the curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To finalize and evaluate the curriculum with a pre-post survey and focus&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Conduct pilot testing of curriculum with 20 youth to further improve and&#xD;
      finalize curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Implement the finalized curriculum with 50 youth and examine the change in youth&#xD;
      outcomes pre to post curriculum based on evaluation survey and four focus groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: Youth will experience a significant positive improvement from pre to post&#xD;
      curriculum for YPAR related outcomes: critical consciousness, research self-efficacy, and&#xD;
      ethnic/racial identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b: Youth will experience a modest positive improvement from pre to post&#xD;
      curriculum for mental health related outcomes: anxiety and depression, stress, and&#xD;
      resilience.&#xD;
