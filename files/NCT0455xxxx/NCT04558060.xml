  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of training with a virtual standardized&#xD;
      patient on the acquisition and maintenance of motivational interviewing skills compared with&#xD;
      traditional academic study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motivational interviewing is an evidence-based counseling approach that aims to increase a&#xD;
      patient's motivation to make positive health changes in their lives. A common training method&#xD;
      for medical professionals is the use of human standardized patients, who are actors who&#xD;
      pretend to be patients for educational interviews. Standardized patients are expensive and it&#xD;
      is challenging to maintain an adequate pool of patient actors. Accordingly, after licensure&#xD;
      or medical boards, health professionals typically adopt new evidence-based practices, like&#xD;
      motivational interviewing, without human standardized patient training experiences. Given the&#xD;
      established importance of post-training coaching and feedback to the acquisition of&#xD;
      motivational interviewing, innovative training methods are needed. Computer virtual patients&#xD;
      may provide a cost-effective alternative that is scalable and supports dissemination of&#xD;
      evidence-based practices. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a virtual standardized&#xD;
      patient, relative to academic study, for training motivational interviewing among health care&#xD;
      professionals from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change in Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity 4.2.1 from Baseline to post-training [approximately 2-weeks after baseline]</time_frame>
    <description>The Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity 4.2.1 is a behavioral coding system for motivational interviewing (MI) skill that involves observer ratings of 4 items on a 5-point Likert-type scale and behavior counts. The 5-point scores for Cultivating Change Talk and Softening Sustain Talk are averaged for a Technical Global summary score, and 5-point scores for Partnership and Empathy are averaged for a Relational Global summary score. Behavior counts include simple reflections, complex reflections and questions posed to patients. These behavior counts generate 2 summary scores; the percentage of reflections that are complex reflections and the ratio of reflections to questions. Participants are also categorized as meeting 'fair' and 'good' MI skill proficiency cut points for each of the 4 summary scores.</description>

    <description>Training for 45 minutes at each training time point with a computer program that presented a virtual human patient and two simulated patient encounters. The virtual standardized patient involves a branching story line. Participants select 1 of 3 computer-generated response options at each conversational pause: 1) a response that is consistent with the principles and skills of MI, 2) an MI inconsistent response, or 3) a response that is mixed - partly consistent and partly inconsistent with MI.</description>
