    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical and functional outcome of a 12-week&#xD;
      rehabilitation regime consisting of Low-Load Blood Flow Restriction compared to Heavy-Slow&#xD;
      Resistance training in male patients with chronic unilateral patellar tendinopathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic tendinopathy represents a considerable problem in both elite and recreational&#xD;
      athletes, and symptoms may affect athletic performance and reduce or even result in&#xD;
      retirement from sports participation. The current best treatment is considered to be&#xD;
      heavy-slow resistance training (HSRT); however, not all patients are able to cope with heavy&#xD;
      exercise loads. Therefore, low-load strength training performed under partial blood flow&#xD;
      restriction may be a clinically relevant rehabilitation tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to investigate a new innovative intervention to treat chronic unilateral&#xD;
      patellar tendinopathy in male individuals using strength training with low-load muscle&#xD;
      contractions performed under partial blood flow restriction (LL-BFR), and to compare the&#xD;
      resulting treatment outcome to that of the current best practice (HSRT). Specifically, the&#xD;
      effect of LL-BFR will be investigated using a randomized controlled trial design with two&#xD;
      groups; 1) a low-load blood flow restriction training program, and 2) a heavy-load slow&#xD;
      strength training program. A total sample size of 36 participants are needed when assuming a&#xD;
      10 % dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training protocol consist of three weekly training sessions during a 12-week&#xD;
      rehabilitation period. The primary outcome is measured using the Single-Leg Decline Squat at&#xD;
      12-week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If LL-BFR proves to be an effective treatment strategy for tendinopathy, it can easily be&#xD;
      implemented in daily clinical practice.&#xD;
