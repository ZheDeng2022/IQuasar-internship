  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are very few studies in the literature about conservative treatment of massive rotator&#xD;
      cuff (RC) tears. Whether the treatment of massive RC tears is conservative or surgical is&#xD;
      decided according to the age, activity level, expectation and additional pathologies of the&#xD;
      patient. The aim of conservative treatment is to make the patient functionally independent&#xD;
      and to reduce pain. In recent years, there are different opinions in the literature about the&#xD;
      effectiveness of conservative treatment of massive RC tears. However, in recent biomechanical&#xD;
      studies, it has been reported that the RC and the deltoid, which remain intact in massive RC&#xD;
      tears, can function well together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that the deltoid-focused physiotherapy program, where&#xD;
      strengthening exercises are performed with EMG biofeedback, will give more positive results&#xD;
      in terms of range of motion (ROM), functional status, muscle strength, pain and patients&#xD;
      satisfaction. aim of our study is to investigate the efficacy of electromyographic&#xD;
      biofeedback (EMG-BF) device which was added to deltoid focused conservative treatment program&#xD;
      in massive RC tears.&#xD;
