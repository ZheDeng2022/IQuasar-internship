  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to test a new Sound Processor (SP) to compare&#xD;
      hearing performance of the new Sound Processor with unaided hearing and Baha 5 SP in adult&#xD;
      subjects and to investigate which device (new Sound Processor versus Baha 5) the subjects&#xD;
      prefer.&#xD;
