  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at how hypertensive patients, with high levels of aldosterone&#xD;
      (hyperaldosteronism) differ from hypertensive patients without hyperaldosteronism with&#xD;
      regards to markers of salt appetite. It also looks at how salt appetite changes after&#xD;
      treatment of hyperaldosteronism. Salt makes food taste good and when our bodies need salt our&#xD;
      brains make us like salty food even more. A high salt diet contributes to hypertension and a&#xD;
      low salt diet is an important aspect of the treatment of hypertension. Unfortunately patients&#xD;
      find it difficult to adhere to a low salt diet. Aldosterone is produced by the adrenal&#xD;
      glands, its release is stimulated by a salt need and it has been shown, in rodent models, to&#xD;
      activate pathways in the brain which drive a salt appetite. Mice with enhanced activity of&#xD;
      the aldosterone pathway in the brain become hypertensive due to increased salt intake.&#xD;
      Hyperaldosteronism, in humans, results in hypertension. The contribution of salt appetite, as&#xD;
      opposed to the effect of aldosterone on the kidney's retention of salt and other systems, is&#xD;
      unknown. Human studies have shown that when a human has a salt appetite, the concentration at&#xD;
      which they can detect the taste of salt reduces, they increase their preference for salty&#xD;
      food, and they consume more salt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When hyperaldosteronism is suspected in a hypertensive patient, they attend hospital for a&#xD;
      day of investigations. Patient who are shown to have hyperaldosteronism have subsequent&#xD;
      visits for imaging of their adrenals and sampling of blood from the adrenal vein to diagnose&#xD;
      aldosterone producing adenomas (small tumours) which may be removed surgically, if not&#xD;
      suitable for surgery, the hyperaldosteronism is treated with medication. This study will&#xD;
      recruit hyperaldosteronism patients to investigate the effect of aldosterone on salt appetite&#xD;
      by testing salt taste threshold, salt taste preference and intake before and after treatment.&#xD;

      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if hypertensive patients with primary hyperaldosteronism have a lower salt&#xD;
           taste threshold and heightened preference for salty soup compared to hypertensive&#xD;
           patients with secondary aldosterone levels and a healthy control reference group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if treating primary hyperaldosteronism, with removal of aldosterone&#xD;
           producing adrenal adenomas or medical blockade of aldosterone, results in changes in&#xD;
           salt taste threshold and preference for salty soup.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           This will be a non-interventional observational study examining a cohort of adult&#xD;
           patients with hypertension under the care of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust who&#xD;
           are being investigated and treated for primary hyperaldosteronism. No clinical&#xD;
           intervention will occur as part of this study outside of their standard clinical&#xD;
           practice. The schedule of events for each study will occur within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 1 This coincides with the saline infusion test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the outcomes of the adrenal MDT discussion subsequent visits will depend on&#xD;
           clinical plan (no further investigation or treatment, medical or surgical treatment) and&#xD;
           will coincide with:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 2 i) adrenal venous sampling (to distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease).&#xD;
           ii) clinic follow up after introduction of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (for&#xD;
           patients deemed unsuitable for adrenal vein sampling)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 3 i) surgical outpatient assessment for removal of an adrenal adenoma. ii) clinic&#xD;
           follow-up after introduction of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (for patients who&#xD;
           carry unacceptably high risks for adrenal surgery or do not wish to have surgery, or&#xD;
           deemed not suitable for removal of adrenal adenoma post adrenal vein sampling e.g. with&#xD;
           bilateral disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 4 i) clinic follow up after adrenal adenoma removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The protocol of investigation for each visit will consist of the following (total time&#xD;
           ~60 mins ):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Salt taste threshold testing This involves the participant, whilst blindfolded, tasting&#xD;
           saline solutions, of varying concentration. The solution is sprayed onto the&#xD;
           participant's tongue, the participant then states if the solution contains salt or not.&#xD;
           Up to 20 solutions are tested (~10 mins) (Ohla et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
           VAS and gLMS training Participants are trained to use labelled hedonic scales (LHS)&#xD;
           (Wood et al., 2009) and general linear model sales (gLMS) (Green et al., 1996) to rate&#xD;
           sensations using an established protocol (Veldhuizen et al., 2017) (5 mins) (Appendix&#xD;
           8).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Salt taste preference testing This involves swilling a solution (soup of variable salt&#xD;
           concentration) in the mouth then expectorating into a bowl. The subject then rates the&#xD;
           solution on various parameters, for example liking, how it relates to &quot;just right&quot;&#xD;
           saltiness, and intensity, using a gLMS. LHS or VAS. Each solution will be repeated 3&#xD;
           times. A sweet solution and bitter solution are also tested. This will take up to 40&#xD;
           mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Saliva collection Saliva will be collected by asking participants to spit into a tube&#xD;
           for up to 5 mins. Saliva will be analysed for electrolytes including sodium and&#xD;
           potassium .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Questionnaires i) Internal state questionnaire to assess internal state: hunger, thirst,&#xD;
           fullness, pleasantness to eat, stress, anxiety, sleepiness, volume able to eat, nausea&#xD;
           (5 mins) (Appendix 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii) Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) to measure positive and negative mood&#xD;
           (Watson et al., 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii) Derby Salt questionnaire (DSQ) to assess habitual salt intake. iv) Beck's&#xD;
           depression inventory (BDI) (visit 1 only) to screen for significant depression which is&#xD;
           a contraindication&#xD;
&#xD;
