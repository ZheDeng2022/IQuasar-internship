  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of TrueBeam stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiosurgery in patients with prostate cancer. The device is designed to concentrate large&#xD;
      doses of radiation onto the tumor so that injury from radiation to the nearby normal tissue&#xD;
      will be minimal. The purpose of this evaluation is to see if this treatment will help&#xD;
      patients with your condition and to evaluate the effect of this treatment on your quality of&#xD;
      life over time. Radiosurgery is a non-invasive treatment technique used to treat tumors.&#xD;
      Despite the word &quot;surgery&quot; in the name, the technology does not remove the tumor with a&#xD;
      surgical knife. Instead, a focused, high-intensity beam of radiation targets the tumor, while&#xD;
      minimizing dose to surrounding normal healthy tissue.&#xD;

      1.0 BACKGROUND 1.1 Prostatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most common forms of malignancy in&#xD;
      men. Every year over 200000 patients are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States.&#xD;
      Treatment options for these patients include active surveillance, radical prostectomy,&#xD;
      external beam radiation therapy, permanent source interstitial brachytherapy and high dose&#xD;
      rate (HDR) brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Each of these treatment options vary in regards to the logistics, anticipated outcomes,&#xD;
      and potential side effects of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 High-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy has been used in the treatment of prostate cancer&#xD;
      since the 1980's with good results. Catheters are placed temporarily in the prostate, and&#xD;
      then loaded with a high-dose Iridium-192 source, delivering a few fractions of very high-dose&#xD;
      RT. Brachytherapy allows the delivery of conformal, high-dose radiotherapy to the prostate,&#xD;
      with a rapid dose fall-off outside of the region. It also takes advantage of low alpha/beta&#xD;
      ratio of prostate cancer by using a hypofractionated approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 The TrueBeam is a noninvasive radiosurgical system, capable of treating any part of the&#xD;
      body from multiple targeting angles, creating a highly conformal three-dimensional&#xD;
      radiosurgical treatment volume, guided by orthogonal X-ray-based targeting feedback, and&#xD;
      delivering radiation by a highly collimated, robotically controlled linear accelerator. The&#xD;
      TrueBeam system targets implanted fiducial markers with sub-millimeter set-up accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 From a dosimetry standpoint, TrueBeam Stereotactic radiosurgery is capable of producing a&#xD;
      dose distribution comparable to that created by prostate HDR brachytherapy treatment, without&#xD;
      the need for invasive transperineal catheters, anesthesia, or inpatient admission. It would&#xD;
      therefore be possible to deliver the HDR boost portion of a patient's treatment in a&#xD;
      non-invasive fashion. As such, the TrueBeam prostate dose fractionation schedule prescribed&#xD;
      in this study is based upon prior published prostate HDR brachytherapy experience both as a&#xD;
      monotherapy and as a boost to external beam radiation therapy in patients with higher risk&#xD;
      disease. The therapeutic volume in this study will also be made to resemble prostate HDR&#xD;
      brachytherapy therapeutic volume, with similar dose limitation objectives to the adjacent&#xD;
      tissues, including the rectum, bladder and urethra. It is theorized that such an approach&#xD;
      should result in similar cancer control rates while lowering overall morbidity and improving&#xD;
      the patient's comfort and convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6 The feasibility of stereotactic body radiation therapy for treating localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer was first described by King at Stanford University. Their phase I protocol delivered&#xD;
      36.25Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25Gy. In a recent report of acute and 18-month late toxicity in&#xD;
      26 &quot;low-risk&quot; patients, no patient experienced grade 3 or 4 acute or late toxicity, and only&#xD;
      one patient experienced a grade 2 late morbidity (urethral stricture). Toxicity was less than&#xD;
      that reported in MD Anderson's external beam dose escalation trial. Mean PSA 18 months after&#xD;
      treatment was 0.22ng/ml. Naples Community Hospital reported a series of more than 70 low and&#xD;
      intermediate risk patients treated with the SBRT. The prostate received 35 Gy in 5 fractions&#xD;
      of 7 Gy each; acute toxicity was minimal. San Diego Cyberknife, which used a virtual HDR&#xD;
      technique, reported a series of more than 124 low and intermediate risk patients treated. The&#xD;
      prostate received 38Gy in 4 fractions of 9.5Gy each; acute toxicity was minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7 Another potential benefit of stereotactic body radiosurgery relative to HDR brachytherapy&#xD;
      is possibly better preservation of potency, even if the radiation distribution is essentially&#xD;
      identical between these modalities. This is so because needle trauma has been identified as a&#xD;
      potentially significant contributory factor to erectile dysfunction with brachytherapy,&#xD;
      including HDR-based monotherapy technique, presumably due to direct physical injury to the&#xD;
      neurovascular bundle and/or bulb of the penis, particularly when greater than 13 needle&#xD;
      insertions are performed. By comparison, stereotactic body radiosurgery is noninvasive, and&#xD;
      so removes this particular erectile dysfunction risk factor.&#xD;
