  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis represents a real challenge in public health as it affects a large&#xD;
      percentage of children and adults. Affected individuals must cope with a significant&#xD;
      psychosocial burden, in addition to dealing with the medical aspects of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this exploratory study is to collect clinical severity AD data, using&#xD;
      PO-SCORAD (self-assessment by the subjects), SCORAD evolution, instrumental measurements and&#xD;
      treatment follow up of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The future objective is to develop a personalised prediction model of AD flares in order to&#xD;
      improve management of AD by more accurate severity evaluations by the subject and the&#xD;
      physician. Development of a method of early detection of flares will open new treatment&#xD;
      pathways for AD management.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a French monocentric exploratory study in adults with mild to&#xD;
      moderate Atopic Dermatitis, and will be conducted on a maximum 25 included subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study will include 4 study visits, after inclusion visit, and the maximum&#xD;
      duration of the study for each subject will be 3 months : Day 1, Day 29, Day 57, Day 85.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of AD flare suspicion, the investigator may recommend a complementary visit. Any&#xD;
      complementary visit will be confirmed by investigator according to the subject's information:&#xD;
      photographs and PO-SCORAD sent by the subject. If visit is confirmed, it will be scheduled as&#xD;
      soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to collect clinical AD severity data in order to evaluate natural AD evolution with&#xD;
           clinical and subject's scales, during a three-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to collect non-invasive instrumental AD data on a target area and on adjacent area:&#xD;
           cutaneous hydration, epidermal barrier conditions and colorimetric parameters on&#xD;
           cutaneous erythema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine clinical and instrumental AD data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to collect illustrative photographs of AD lesions&#xD;
