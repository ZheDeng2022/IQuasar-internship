  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy has been shown to improve quality of life for cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The combination of exercise therapy + radiation therapy for men with prostate&#xD;
      cancer receiving radiation has never been studied. In the current work of exercise therapy +&#xD;
      radiation therapy (EXERT) for metastatic prostate cancer, we will assess how patient quality&#xD;
      of life changes after treatment (Aim 1). We believe that exercise will reduce the side&#xD;
      effects of the radiation and therefore improve quality of life. Additionally, we believe that&#xD;
      the mechanism behind the improvement is due to changes to the immune system, so we will&#xD;
      measure changes in immune function (Aim 2). Since quality of life predicts survival, and&#xD;
      exercise therapy may improve quality of life, we believe that exercise therapy for these men&#xD;
      will improve their length of life (Aim 3).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2018, 30,000 patients were diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer in the US. Short-course&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT) is a mainstay of treatment for symptomatic metastases, and it&#xD;
      stimulates an immune response against the tumor. However, RT also decreases systemic&#xD;
      interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), placing the body in a pro-inflammatory state, and&#xD;
      increasing fatigue and reducing quality of life (QOL). Fatigue and QOL are surrogates of the&#xD;
      limited 2-20 month survival time. If fatigue and quality of life are improved, then toxicity&#xD;
      and survival will follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to identify the potential for exercise therapy (ET) to improve RT&#xD;
      treatment toxicities and outcomes among metastatic cancer patients. The mechanistic&#xD;
      hypothesis is that adding ET training to RT decreases long-term systemic inflammation,&#xD;
      mitigating toxicity thereby widening the therapeutic window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Quantify the potential of ET to mitigate RT toxicities and physical function decline.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that ET mitigates patient-reported QOL and toxicities of RT. Our approach&#xD;
      in 1A will be to use standardized questionnaires and assessment tools: toxicity is measured&#xD;
      using the NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System library + Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. In 1B, we will use 30-second chair stand and timed&#xD;
      up-and-go. Pre vs post difference scores for each variable would be compared with a&#xD;
      generalized estimating equations (GEE) model with an ordinal logistic link function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Characterize the immunologic mechanism by which ET mitigates RT toxicity. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that ET training mitigates toxicity of RT (measured in aim 1) by increasing&#xD;
      serum interleukin-1Ra. Our approach will be to measure IL-1Ra pre-RT and 1 month post-RT±ET.&#xD;
      We will similarly measure exploratory pro-inflammatory (IL-1B, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-15, CRP)&#xD;
      and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) markers using a GEE model with ordinal logistic link function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Evaluate the ability of ET to improve survival. Since physical function is a surrogate&#xD;
      of survival, the hypothesis is that adding ET to RT will improve overall survival, measured&#xD;
      from the date of random assignment to date of death. This pilot work is essential for the&#xD;
      development of a full scale randomized trial, to be funded by an R01 application to NCI,&#xD;
      planned for submission within 1 year of pilot study completion.&#xD;

    <measure>Evaluation of symptomatic toxicity in study participants using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events- Patient Reported Outcomes (CTCAE-PRO)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The PRO-CTCAE characterizes the frequency, severity, interference, and presence/absence of symptomatic toxicities that include pain, fatigue, nausea, and cutaneous side effects that can be meaningfully reported from the patient perspective. PRO-CTCAE responses are scored from 0 to 4 (or 0/1 for absent/present) and evaluate the symptom attributes of frequency, severity, interference, amount, presence/absence. Each symptomatic Adverse Event is assessed by 1-3 attributes. Criteria for grading on the CTCAE scale vary by toxicity. Grade 1: asymptomatic or mild symptoms not requiring intervention. Grade 2: moderate symptoms that interfere somewhat with daily function and where some intervention may be indicated. Grade 3: severe symptoms that interfere with daily activities or require more significant intervention. Grade 4: toxicity that is life-threatening, with urgent intervention indicated.</description>

    <description>Physical activity behavior in the domains of commuting activity, leisure time activities such as cycling, walking, and sports, household and occupational activity will be assessed via a standardized and validated questionnaire, the Godin Physical Activity Questionnaire. Total weekly leisure activity is calculated in arbitrary units by summing the products of the separate components, as shown in the following formula:&#xD;
Weekly leisure activity score = (9 × Strenuous) + (5 × Moderate) + (3 × Light) Higher activity score = more active</description>

    <description>The Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) assesses the frequency and severity of fatigue as well as its perceived disruptiveness. Frequency is measured as the number of days in the past week (0-7) respondents felt fatigued as well as the percentage of each day on average they felt fatigued (0 = none, 10 = entire day).</description>

    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire assesses the effect of patient's health problems on their ability to work and perform regular activities. Subjects self reports as &quot;fill in blank&quot; answers to questions and also as circling a number on a 10 point scale where 0 = Problem had no effect on my work and 10 = Problem completely prevented me from doing my daily activities.</description>

    <measure>Barriers to Exercise RM 5-FM</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Examines factors that have an impact on the development and implementation of and adherence to a personal physical activity plan. Questions are scored on a range of 0-3 where, Very Unlikely = 0 and Very Likely = 3. Barriers to physical activity fall into one or more of seven categories: lack of time, social influences, lack of energy, lack of willpower, fear of injury, lack of skill, and lack of resources. A score of 5 or above in any category shows that this is an important barrier to overcome.</description>

At their baseline visit, they will meet with the exercise physiologist, each participant will be provided a personalized exercise prescription to follow at home and will be asked to record what they do in between daily radiation treatment visits on the exercise tracking log provided to them. Participants will exercise between 1 and 7 times/week depending on the patient's tolerance to the treatment and exercise prescription. The exercise physiologist will meet with the participant at every radiation treatment visit for a brief 15-30 minute exercise counseling check in. After the participant's five radiation treatments, the exercise physiologist will follow-up with the participants via phone call once per week for 4 weeks during the follow-up period.</description>
