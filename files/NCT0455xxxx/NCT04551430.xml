  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the response rate of soft tissue sarcoma will be&#xD;
      improved with the addition of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition to cabozantinib, and that&#xD;
      cabozantinib priming will increase the response to nivolumab and ipilimumab.&#xD;

    <measure>Radiographic response rate by RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Through end of treatment (estimated to be 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate = proportion of participants who achieve complete response or partial response&#xD;
Complete response: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).&#xD;
Partial response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical benefit rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Through end of treatment (estimated to be 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-A confirmed clinical benefit is defined to be either a CR or PR noted as the objective status on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 4 weeks apart or a confirmed SD at two consecutive tumor assessments at least 3 months apart. The CBR will be estimated by the number of patients with confirmed clinical benefit divided by the total number of evaluable patients</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
Progressive disease: Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.&#xD;
Patients will be censored at time of subsequent treatment regardless of response</description>

    <measure>Response rate to ipilimumab + nivolumab after cabozantinib priming</measure>
    <time_frame>Through end of treatment (estimated to be 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate = proportion of participants who achieve complete response or partial response&#xD;
Complete response: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).&#xD;

    <description>7 statements with answers ranging from 0=Not at all to 4=Very much. The higher the score, the better the quality of life&#xD;
The sum of the item scores will be multiplied by the number of items in the subscale then divided by the number of items answered. This will produce the total score.</description>
