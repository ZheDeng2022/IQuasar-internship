    <textblock>
      The KOHDIAK study is a prospective, three-armed, randomised, double-blind study to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of the treatment of mild and moderate actinic keratosis with a 5%&#xD;
      potassium hydroxide solution (Solcera, medical device) versus placebo and&#xD;
      investigator-blinded comparison with 3% diclofenac gel (Solaraze, medicinal product). It is&#xD;
      performed in accordance with both the laws in force for clinical trials with medical devices&#xD;
      and those with medicinal products.&#xD;
