  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, one of the reasons for the low blood sugar control rate in China is related to&#xD;
      the late use of basic insulin and insufficient dose adjustment. If the community hospital can&#xD;
      actively treat the diabetic patients who need to use insulin and adjust the dose in time, it&#xD;
      will certainly improve the blood sugar control rate. However, at present, community doctors&#xD;
      basically do not take the initiative to start insulin treatment, but only passively use&#xD;
      insulin that has been prescribed by specialists, and there is a lack of ability to adjust the&#xD;
      dose of insulin and treatment inertia. Therefore, it is very necessary for community doctors&#xD;
      to receive guidance from endocrine specialists to improve their ability to use insulin. This&#xD;
      study intends to carry out a study of endocrine specialists guiding community doctors to use&#xD;
      basic insulin in the treatment of adult type 2 diabetes in Shenzhen Community Hospital.&#xD;
      Through this study to understand whether the effectiveness and safety of community doctors&#xD;
      actively using basic insulin therapy under the guidance of specialists can reach the level of&#xD;
      specialists.&#xD;

      The study consists of two parts: the screening period and the treatment follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening period (day 0): patients were screened according to the inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria, and informed consent was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment follow-up period (day 1-day 90)： Day 1： （1）all patients in the group received&#xD;
           diet and exercise education；（2）Collect patients' basic data (name, sex, age, height,&#xD;
           weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, etc.), detect plasma FBG and HbA1c (sent&#xD;
           to the central laboratory for testing)；（3）Initial treatment： On the basis of the&#xD;
           original oral medicine, the patient will initial basic insulin. The initial dose of&#xD;
           basic insulin is 0.2U/kg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2-Day 89:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Community patient group：The community doctor adjusts the dosage of insulin daily&#xD;
           according to the patient's FBG: the dose is titrated by increments of 0.07U/kg daily&#xD;
           until the fasting blood glucose （FBG）≤7 mmol / L, and if the FBG≤ 3.9mmol/L, the&#xD;
           0.07U/kg is reduced. Inpatient group：Endocrinologists in the in-patient department use&#xD;
           the same basic insulin dose adjustment regimen to treat patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It can be discontinued when the basic insulin is reduced to 8U and the fasting blood&#xD;
           glucose reaches the standard for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 90：Patients were re-examined the plasma FBG and HbA1c (sent to the central laboratory for&#xD;
      testing), and community doctors filled in the treatment experience questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up requirements: Patients use the complimentary blood glucose meter to monitor FPG&#xD;
      every day, 2 hours postprandial blood glucose and night blood glucose are optional, and blood&#xD;
      sugar is measured at any time if there are symptoms of hypoglycemia. The community doctor&#xD;
      adjusted the insulin dose according to the blood glucose level every day, and the patients&#xD;
      were followed up by telephone every week to collect the use of hypoglycemia, diet, exercise&#xD;
      and other hypoglycemic drugs, and record the time when the FPG reached the standard, the&#xD;
      total amount of insulin glargine, hypoglycemia and so on.&#xD;
