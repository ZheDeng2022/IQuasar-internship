  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the feasibility of a mobile application-based home exercise&#xD;
      rehabilitation program for patients with pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation programs that incorporate exercise training are an important&#xD;
      component of optimal medical care for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic&#xD;
      thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), which improves exercise performance, quality&#xD;
      of life, and may even modify disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no studies have utilized mobile health (mHealth) technology to provide exercise&#xD;
      program interventions in the pulmonary hypertension population. Leveraging mobile technology,&#xD;
      such as smartphones or tablets, to administer a home-based exercise rehabilitation program&#xD;
      could improve patient access, satisfaction, and participation, while providing sustained&#xD;
      physiologic benefits and incurring major cost savings compared to inpatient or&#xD;
      outpatient-based supervised programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesis is that a home-based exercise program delivered by a mobile app will be&#xD;
      feasible and safe for PAH/CTEPH patients. The secondary outcomes assessed will explore&#xD;
      whether there are changes in exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and right&#xD;
      ventricular function, compared to standard care.&#xD;

    <description>The exercise program will be administered over 12 weeks through the Ethica mobile app. Participants will perform exercise sessions at home guided by instructional video accessed via Ethica, six days per week. The program will include a combination of education, endurance, strength, and respiratory muscle training.&#xD;
The Ethica mobile app will provide a daily alert and a daily exercise video. There will be background monitoring of step counts and actigraphy will be monitored for one week intervals at baseline, at week six, and at week twelve.</description>

    <description>The Ethica mobile app will provide a daily alert accompanied by a short educational statement about PAH, disease self-management tips, dietary and nutritional advice, goal setting, and a motivational statement to encourage patients.&#xD;
Participation with each session will be assessed by a mobile app-embedded survey administered at the end of the day. Patients will be presented with weekly alerts to complete validated patient-reported quality of life questionnaires using the EmPHasis-10 and the Living with Pulmonary Hypertension Questionnaire, as well as the PRAISE self-efficacy score for pulmonary rehabilitation. The app will also ask patients to report their WHO/NYHA functional class every week. Using in-app buttons, participants can log adverse events associated with each exercise session.</description>
