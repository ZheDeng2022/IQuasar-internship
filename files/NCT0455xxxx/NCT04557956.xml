      This phase I/II trial investigates the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      tazemetostat in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in treating patients with melanoma&#xD;
      that has a specific mutation in the BRAF gene (BRAFV600) and that has spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body (metastatic). Tazemetostat, dabrafenib, and trametinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving tazemetostat in&#xD;
      combination with dabrafenib and trametinib may stabilize BRAFV600 mutated melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify a maximum tolerated dose for the EZH2 inhibitor, tazemetostat hydrobromide&#xD;
      (tazemetostat), when used in combination with dual BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib mesylate&#xD;
      [dabrafenib]) and MEK inhibitor (trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide [trametinib]) therapy in&#xD;
      BRAF/MEK inhibitor-resistant, BRAF^V600-mutated metastatic melanoma. (Phase 1) II. To&#xD;
      determine if the addition of the EZH2 inhibitor, tazemetostat, to BRAF and MEK inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy improves progression-free survival over single-agent EZH2 inhibitor therapy in&#xD;
      patients with BRAF/MEK inhibitor-resistant, BRAF^V600-mutated melanomas harboring an EZH2&#xD;
      alteration. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase 1) II. To determine the overall response&#xD;
      rate of single-agent EZH2 inhibitor therapy (tazemetostat) and triplet EZH2 inhibitor&#xD;
      (tazemetostat), BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitor (trametinib) therapy in&#xD;
      patients with BRAF/MEK inhibitor-resistant BRAF^V600-mutated melanomas harboring an EZH2&#xD;
      alteration. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore alterations in the gene expression profile (ribonucleic acid [RNA]-sequencing),&#xD;
      H3K27 methylome (immunohistochemistry [IHC], chromatin immunoprecipitation&#xD;
      [ChIP]-Sequencing), and open chromatin landscape (assay for transposase accessible chromatin&#xD;
      [ATAC]-sequencing) with EZH2 inhibition in fresh clinical or patient derived xenograft&#xD;
      (PDX)-derived tumor samples, which may reveal underlying transcriptional/epigenetic pathways&#xD;
      mediating response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation trial of tazemetostat followed by a phase II&#xD;
      trial. Patients in the phase I trial receive treatment as in Arm II. Patients in the phase II&#xD;
      trial are randomized to Arm I or Arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive tazemetostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At the&#xD;
      time of progression, patients may crossover to Arm II after completion of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive tazemetostat PO BID, dabrafenib PO BID, and trametinib PO once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then annually&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

             or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be able to swallow and retain oral medication and must not have any&#xD;

             maintain central catheter patency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of tazemetostat, and the combination of tazemetostat, dabrafenib and&#xD;
             trametinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. Women of childbearing potential&#xD;
             and all male patients must agree to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
                  heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure&#xD;
                  rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period, for 6 months after&#xD;
                  tazemetostat discontinuation, or for 6 months after discontinuation of the&#xD;
                  combination of tazemetostat, dabrafenib and trametinib. Should a woman become&#xD;
                  pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she&#xD;
                  should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is&#xD;
                       postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (&gt;= 12 continuous&#xD;
                       months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has&#xD;
                       not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year&#xD;
                       include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established, proper&#xD;
                       use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing&#xD;
                       intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Due to the potential of enzyme induction with tazemetostat, female subjects&#xD;
                       who use hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of&#xD;
                       birth control while on study treatment and for 6 months after&#xD;
                       discontinuation of tazemetostat or the combination of tazemetostat,&#xD;
                       dabrafenib and trametinib&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                       duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                       patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                       post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                       contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men&#xD;
                  must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at&#xD;
                  least 4 months after the last dose of study drug. Men must refrain from donating&#xD;
                  sperm during this same period. In addition, female partners of male subjects&#xD;
                  should adhere to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Intrauterine device (IUD) (must provide medical documentation of IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hormonal contraceptive (partner must be on a stable dose of the same&#xD;
                       hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before receiving study&#xD;
                       drug) AND a condom (hormonal contraceptives must be supplemented with&#xD;
                       condoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;

             care anti-PD-1 based immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             documented by imaging). Subjects on a stable dose of corticosteroids for &gt; 1 week can&#xD;
             be enrolled. Subjects must also be off of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants for &gt; 4&#xD;
             weeks&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unresolved toxicity of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
             Adverse Events, version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0) grade 2 or higher from previous&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  History or evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled cardiac&#xD;
