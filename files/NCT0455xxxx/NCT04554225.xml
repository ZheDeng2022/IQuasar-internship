    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is common symptom in pulmonary diseases, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) or other pulmonary disease. Ambulatory oxygen therapy is often prescribed to these&#xD;
      patients. In these patients resilience, health related quality of life, life satisfaction are&#xD;
      measured and the effect and patient satisfaction to ambulatory oxygen therapy are studied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is a common symptom in pulmonary disease patients, such as chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung diseases. These patients often have low&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and life satisfaction (LS), and high levels of anxiety&#xD;
      and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen therapy is used in severe pulmonary diseases to improve HRQoL and prolong survival.&#xD;
      Ambulatory oxygen therapy is prescribed to patients who become transiently hypoxemic, e.g.&#xD;
      during exercise or normal outdoors activities. However, only 46 % of COPD patients were&#xD;
      adherent to long-term oxygen therapy. Proper adaptation to a serious illness, such as&#xD;
      advanced COPD and interstitial lung diseases, necessitates resilience. Resilience is an&#xD;
      ability to adapt appropriately in difficulties in life. This ability is based on a person's&#xD;
      psychological resources, and it can be learned and improved with time and effort. Evaluation&#xD;
      of resilience is commonly applied in psychological examinations and research, but less&#xD;
      attention has been paid in medical context even though resilience capacity is closely&#xD;
      connected to recovery abilities and adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim is to measure resilience in pulmonary disease patients receiving ambulatory&#xD;
      oxygen therapy and how it correlates with other measures of HRQoL and LS. Also anxiety and&#xD;
      depression are surveyed and satisfaction to ambulatory oxygen therapy devices and associated&#xD;
      services.Investigators also compare the HRQoL of pulmonary disease patients receiving&#xD;
      ambulatory oxygen therapy to an age and gender matched sample of the general population.&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with low resilience, and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes were how resilience correlated with HRQoL, LS, anxiety and depression in patients&#xD;
      prescribed ambulatory oxygen therapy.&#xD;
