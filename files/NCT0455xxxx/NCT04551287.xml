  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to establish a Cervical Cancer Artificial Intelligence&#xD;
      Screening System (CAISS) for cervical cytology grade diagnosis through diverse cervical&#xD;
      cytological whole slide images (WSIs) from different hospitals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite being one of the most preventable cancers through screening, cervical cancer is the&#xD;
      fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. Remarkable progress has been made in deep&#xD;
      learning algorithms in recent years, but its clinical application in cervical cancer cytology&#xD;
      screening still limited. In this study, a Cervical Cancer Artificial Intelligence Screening&#xD;
      System (CAISS) was trained and validated for cervical cytology grade diagnosis through&#xD;
      diverse cervical cytological whole slide images (WSIs) from different hospitals.&#xD;

Here, 618 slides were collected between August 13, 2020, and December 14, 2020, to build the SYSMH randomized controlled trial. The remaining 608 slides after quality control were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to the CAISS group (n = 201), the cytotechnician group (n = 203), and the CAISS-assisted combination group (n = 204).</description>
