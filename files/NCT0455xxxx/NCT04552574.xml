  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigate whether HMR(Home meal replacement)-type omega-3-balanced-diet can improve&#xD;
      clinical laboratory values related to chronic metabolic diseases through reducing lipids and&#xD;
      chronic inflammation, and can prevent muscle loss.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Korea is entering an post-aged society with an increase in single-person households, and as&#xD;
      the average life expectancy increases, the increase in the population exposed to chronic&#xD;
      metabolic diseases requires basic dietary solutions for life seeking physical, mental and&#xD;
      social well-being. As a result of a survey conducted by the Korean Health Insurance&#xD;
      Corporation (2010), medical expenses for chronic metabolic diseases were estimated at&#xD;
      15,233.8 billion won, with 54.3% of adults with chronic diseases, 68.7% in their 50s, 83.7%&#xD;
      in their 60s, and 91.3% in their 70s or older. This trend continues to increase, resulting in&#xD;
      an increasing social burden. Our researchers focused on functional lipids which provide&#xD;
      specific health benefits when ingested to prevent these chronic diseases. Omega 3 is an&#xD;
      essential fatty acid that can not be synthesized in the body, maintaining the structure of&#xD;
      cells in the human body, helping smooth metabolism. It also inhibits the aggregation of&#xD;
      platelets and lowers the risk of coronary artery or cardiovascular disease by lowering the&#xD;
      level of neutrality, it has been reported to have an inflammatory mitigation effect. Omega 6&#xD;
      has been reported to cause increased inflammation and ulticaria, asthma, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease side effects when intake is increased. In this context, the recommended ratio of&#xD;
      omega 3 and omega 6 is reported to be within 1:4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diet of which omega-3 to omega-6 ratio is below 1:4 was developed by Agricultural entity&#xD;
      Green Grass Co., Ltd. for prevention of sarcopenia and chronic metabolic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to the test group receive a total of 4 weeks HMR medifood and consume a&#xD;
      regular diet for the next four weeks after having a wash-out period for a total of two weeks.&#xD;
      On the other hand, subjects assigned to the control group would be able to consume a regular&#xD;
      diet for the first four weeks and take HMR medifood for the next four weeks after having a&#xD;
      two-week wash-out period.&#xD;
