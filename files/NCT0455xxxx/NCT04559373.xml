  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While stroke survivors discharged from rehabilitation present with some recovery in mobility,&#xD;
      their ability to ambulate in the community remains limited. The investigators propose to test&#xD;
      a novel, low-cost, intensive and individually tailored intervention that combines virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) and field training to enhance community ambulation and participation in stroke&#xD;
      survivors discharged from rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to: (1) Assess feasibility, acceptability, safety and adherence of the&#xD;
      intervention in stroke survivors; and (2) Examine the extent to which post-intervention&#xD;
      changes in functional walking and participation to community walking vary according to&#xD;
      walking, cognitive and visual-perceptual abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a virtual environment prototype simulating a shopping mall and&#xD;
      surrounding streets, in which participants will interact using VR goggles and game&#xD;
      controllers. Scenarios of increasing levels of complexity will be introduced. This&#xD;
      intervention study involves a single group, multiple pre- multiple post- study design where&#xD;
      chronic stroke participants will engage in a 4-week training program. The program will&#xD;
      include VR training sessions performed in the clinical setting (3/week) and practice of&#xD;
      community ambulation skills while supervised by family/caregivers (2/week). Participants will&#xD;
      be assessed on measures of functional walking, balance &amp; mobility and participation to&#xD;
      community walking. Adherence, safety and acceptability will be documented. This study will&#xD;
      generate foundation knowledge on the response to the intervention based on individual&#xD;
      capacities.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ambulating in community environments requires the skills to cope with multiple, simultaneous&#xD;
      dimensions such as walking speed and distance, etc. Such skills remain compromised in the&#xD;
      majority of stroke survivors due to insufficient or lack of targeted practice. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to test a new, individually-tailored intervention, developed by the&#xD;
      research team, grounded in best evidence in community ambulation, principles of motor&#xD;
      learning and participatory action research. This unique intervention will combine virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) and field training practice to optimize learning that can be generalized to&#xD;
      daily walking activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will engage in the 4-week, individually-tailored intervention that comprises of&#xD;
      supervised VR training sessions (3 times/week) performed in the clinical setting. VR sessions&#xD;
      will be completed by field training assignments. Subjects will be assessed twice prior to the&#xD;
      intervention, immediately after the intervention and at follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalized estimating equations will be used to compare changes in main and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes across time points, with each personal factor of interest (e.g. walking capacity,&#xD;
      visual-perceptual function, and cognitive function) analyzed individually while adjusting for&#xD;
      age. Outcomes on adherence, safety and acceptability will be analyzed with descriptive&#xD;
      statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Required sample size was estimated based on Green's rule (effect size=0.5, power=80%, Î±=0.05)&#xD;
      with a variance inflation factor assuming moderate within-subject correlations for 3&#xD;
      post-baseline measurement time points. This yields a sample size of 30. Assuming a worst-case&#xD;
      scenario of 30% attrition rate, a total of 40 stroke subjects (20/site) will be recruited.&#xD;
