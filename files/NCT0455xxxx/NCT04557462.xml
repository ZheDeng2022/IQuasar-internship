  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability, of open label&#xD;
      iptacopan in primary IgA nephropathy participants who have completed either the CLNP023X2203&#xD;
      or CLNP023A2301 clinical trials. The open-label design of the current study is appropriate to&#xD;
      provide study participants the opportunity to receive treatment with iptacopan until&#xD;
      marketing authorizations are received and the drug product becomes commercially available&#xD;
      while enabling collection of long-term safety and tolerability data for the investigational&#xD;
      drug. Furthermore efficacy assessments conducted every 6 months will afford the opportunity&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical effects of iptacopan on long-term disease progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter roll-over extension program (REP) to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CLNP023X2203, a Phase II trial investigating the dose ranging effects of LNP023 on&#xD;
           efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and tolerability in&#xD;
           primary IgAN patients, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CLNP023A2301, a Phase III trial, investigating the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
           pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and tolerability of LNP023 in patients with primary IgAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects completing the CLNP023X2203 and CLNP023A2301 trials on study drug, who want to&#xD;
      continue treatment and who meet the inclusion/exclusion requirements of the roll over&#xD;
      extension program, will have the opportunity to receive iptacopan until:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 years from LPFV of this study CLNP023A2002B, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant no longer derives benefit from iptacopan according to the Investigator,&#xD;
           or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the benefit-risk profile of the product in IgAN is no longer positive, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  initiation of maintenance hemodialysis, kidney transplantation or eGFR &lt; 15&#xD;
           mL/min/1.73m2 , or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the product becomes commercially available in a specific country following product&#xD;
           launch and subsequent reimbursement for IgAN, where applicable, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if a marketing application or reimbursement of an investigational product is&#xD;
           rejected/not pursued in a region/country for the indication under study or which ever is&#xD;
           sooner&#xD;
