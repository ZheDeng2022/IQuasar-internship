      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE in combination with&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric open-labal trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with Camrelizumab and Apatinib versus TACE in&#xD;
      patients with intermediate- and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary&#xD;
      hypotheses are that TACE in combination with Camrelizumab and Apatinib is superior to TACE&#xD;
      alone with respect to progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to progression or death from any cause. Progression in this trial was determined as untreatable (UnTACEable) progression, defined as the inability of a patients to further receive or benefit from TACE for reasons that included intrahepatic tumor progression (50% increased vs baseline) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Cancer of the Liver (RECICL) version 5, transient deterioration of liver function to Child-Pugh C right after TACE, macrovascular invasion (MVI) or extra hepatic spread (EHS) (diameter&gt;10 mm). Progression in this trial also included progression that met the JSH criteria for TACE failure/refractoriness.</description>
