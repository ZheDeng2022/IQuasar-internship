  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization estimates that smoking is one of the leading causes of&#xD;
      premature death worldwide with an estimated 5-8 million lives lost annually due to tobacco&#xD;
      usage (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heated tobacco products (HTP) is a new form of tobacco products. HTP usually consists of a&#xD;
      pod with tobacco that is mixed with glycerol which is inserted into a heating chamber. HTP is&#xD;
      not combusted but only heated (2). Previous studies into smoking cessation with regular&#xD;
      cigarettes and electronic cigarettes have suggested a risk for double usage instead of&#xD;
      cessation, augmenting a nicotine addiction (3-5). There is a risk that HTP use simply&#xD;
      enhances nicotine usage and smoking addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited data on the health effects of HTP. A majority of the studies available have&#xD;
      reported conflicts of interest to manufacturers of HTP (11). It has been shown that aerosols&#xD;
      from HTP contain toxic compounds and free radicals just as in regular cigarette smoke, albeit&#xD;
      in lower concentrations (6-8). Furthermore, aerosols from HTP can spread in a room, enabling&#xD;
      passive exposure (9). It has been shown that there is a decrease in harmful biomarkers in&#xD;
      smokers that switch to HTP after 5 days of usage but also of a higher HTP consumption&#xD;
      compared to regular smoking (12). There are few studies on effects of HTP in humans.&#xD;
      Nabavizadeh et al has shown impaired endothelial function in rats after exposure to IQOS&#xD;
      (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      _____________&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty male or female occasional tobacco users (age 18-40, maximum 10 cigarettes per month or&#xD;
      10 pouches of snus per month) will be included. They have to be healthy, having no&#xD;
      preexisting conditions or take any medications. All subjects will have to complete a normal&#xD;
      health declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In randomized cross-over fashion subjects will either inhale vapor (1 puff per minute for 30&#xD;
      minutes, total 30 puffs) from a HTP of the brand IQOS (IQOS 3 Multi, Philip Morris AB) or&#xD;
      perform sham-smoking of HTP. Measurements of arterial stiffness is performed previous, during&#xD;
      and 60 minutes following exposures. Blood samples will be collected at baseline for cotinine,&#xD;
      measurement with T-TAS, endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), NETs and extracellular vesicles&#xD;
      (EV). Blood samples will be drawn up to 3 hours post-exposure (EPC, T-TAS,EV, NETs).&#xD;
      Microcirculation is evaluated at baseline with skin capillaroscopy and Laser-Speckle contrast&#xD;
      imaging (LSCI) and at 1 hour post-exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of vascular function Arterial stiffness (Sphygmocor) Increased arterial stiffness&#xD;
      is recognized as a major factor in vascular aging and a risk factor for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (13). Arterial stiffness will be assessed by pulse wave analysis and pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photopletysmography (PPG) Finger photoplethysmography is another method that provides&#xD;
      information on the arterial bloodflow which allows measurement of pulse propagation time&#xD;
      (PPT) (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of microcirculation Microcirculation will be assessed by several methods. Skin&#xD;
      perfusion is investigated through Laser Speckle contrast Imaging , which is an optical&#xD;
      technique for assessment of skin flux, i.e movement of circulating red blood cells. This&#xD;
      method measures overall skin flux in superficial arterioles, capillaries and venules over&#xD;
      wide skin areas and with a high frequency. Iontophoresis is a non-invasive method for drug&#xD;
      application across the skin using a small electric current. Acetylcholine (ACh, Sigma-Aldrich&#xD;
      AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA),&#xD;
      both diluted in 9% physiological sodium chloride solutions, are used to investigate&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent microvascular reactivity, respectively.&#xD;
      Electrode chambers (LI611 Drug Delivery Electrode, Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) are attached to&#xD;
      the volar side of the left forearm, avoiding hair, broken skin and visible veins, and filled&#xD;
      with a small volume of either ACh (2%) or SNP (2%). A battery-powered iontophoresis&#xD;
      controller (Perilont LI 760; Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) provides a single dose of 0.02 mA for&#xD;
      200 seconds for drug iontophoresis. ACh is delivered using an anodal charge and SNP with a&#xD;
      cathodal charge. LSCI (PeriCam PSI NR; Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) is used to assess skin&#xD;
      microvascular flux continuously before, during and 15 minutes after iontophoresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin capillaroscopy is another method for evaluating the microcirculation. A USB microscope&#xD;
      (CapillaryScope 500 pro, Dino-Lite®) is used to visualize nail fold capillaries in the finger&#xD;
      (preferably 4th digit of left hand). Capillaries with good optical signals, i.e. with visible&#xD;
      red blood cell movements and plasma gaps, are chosen for examination. Capillary blood flow is&#xD;
      registered continuously at rest, during and after one-minute arterial occlusion at the&#xD;
      proximal phalanx of the digit with a suprasystolic cuff pressure. Calculation of capillary&#xD;
      blood cell velocity (CBV, mm/s) is done off line and will generate following four variables:&#xD;
      rCVB (mean CBV at rest), pCVB (peak CBV following one-minute arterial occlusion), time to&#xD;
      peak (time (s) from release of cuff pressure to peak flow, and post-occlusive reactive&#xD;
      hyperemia (precentral increase of CBV from rest to peak flow).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A semi-automatic oscillometric sphygmomanometer will be used to measure blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling Blood samples will be drawn into test tubes containing 1/10 0.129 M sodium&#xD;
      citrate, EDTA and serum at baseline, at 2 hour and 4 hours after exposure. Plasma is later&#xD;
      collected after centrifugation at 2 000g for 20 min in room temperature (RT) and then frozen&#xD;
      at -70°C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of thrombus formation (T-TAS) T-TAS® (Total Thrombus-formation Analysis System)&#xD;
      is a means of assessing thrombus formation during variable flow conditions using a small&#xD;
      blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of cotinine Measurement is done to ensure adherence that subjects have not used&#xD;
      tobacco in the last 7 days. Levels of cotinine will be measured in serum using a commercial&#xD;
      available ELISA technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of EPCs The number of EPCs will be measured in whole blood by flow cytometry.&#xD;
      EPCs are measured as CD34+ KDR+ (KDR: vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) double&#xD;
      positive cells. Briefly, 20 µl of whole blood is incubated with CD34-FITC (Beckman Coulter,&#xD;
      Brea, CA, USA) and CD309 (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA). Conjugate&#xD;
      isotype-matched immuno-globulin (IgG1-FITC, IgG1-PE) with no reactivity against human&#xD;
      antigens are used as a negative control. After 30 minutes of incubation in a dark&#xD;
      environment, BD cell-fix is added to fixate the samples. Twenty thousand events of leukocytes&#xD;
      are collected (based on classical forward scatter/side scatter (size/granularity)&#xD;
      characteristics of blood leukocytes) and results will be presented as a number of EPC events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Extracellular Vesicles Plasma is thawed and centrifuged at 2000g for 20&#xD;
      minutes at RT. The supernatant is then re-centrifuged, at 13 000g for 2 minutes at RT. 20 µl&#xD;
      of sample is incubated for 20 minutes in dark with phalloidin-Alexa-660 (Invitrogen, Paisley,&#xD;
      UK), lactadherin-FITC (Haematologic Technologies, Vermont, USA), CD42a-PE (Platelet-MP (PMP),&#xD;
      BD, Clone Alma-16), CD45-PC7 (Leukocyte-EV (LEV), Beckman Coulter, Dublin, Ireland) and&#xD;
      CD144-APC (Endothelial-EV (EEV), AH diagnostics, Stockholm, SWE). PEVs are also labeled with&#xD;
      CD154-PE (CD40L, abcam, Cambridge, UK) and EEVs with CD62E (E-selectin, Beckman Coulter,&#xD;
      Dublin, Ireland). EVs are measured by flow cytometry on a Beckman Gallios instrument (CA,&#xD;
      USA). The EV-gate is determined using Megamix beads (BioCytex, Marseille, France), which is a&#xD;
      mix of beads of with diameters of 0.5 µm, 0.9 µm and 3.0 µm, respectively. EVs are defined as&#xD;
      particles less than 1.0 µm in size, negative to phalloidin (in order to exclude cell membrane&#xD;
      fragments) and positive to lactadherin. Conjugate isotype-matched immunoglobulin (IgG1-FITC,&#xD;
      IgG1-PE, IgG1-APC and IgG1- PC7) with no reactivity against human antigens is used as a&#xD;
      negative control to define the background noise of the cytometric analysis. The absolute&#xD;
      number of EVs is calculated by means of the following formula: (EV counted x standard beads ⁄&#xD;
      L) ⁄ standard beads counted, (FlowCount, Beckman Coulter).&#xD;
