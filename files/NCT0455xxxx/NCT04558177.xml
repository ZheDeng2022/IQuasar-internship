    <textblock>
      Many seniors admitted for rehabilitation have symptoms of depression and anxiety that need to&#xD;
      be treated before they can effectively engage in rehabilitation therapy. Anti-depressant or&#xD;
      anti-anxiety medications are often used but there are many reasons why alternative or&#xD;
      adjunctive treatments may be desirable. Medications can take weeks to become effective, if&#xD;
      they work at all. There are many potential side effects of medications, especially in an&#xD;
      older population, including cognitive and other neurologic impairments. There is also an&#xD;
      increasing resistance to a polypharmacy approach to treatment in this population. A low-risk,&#xD;
      relatively non-invasive, easily applied and well-tolerated treatment to accelerate mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorder resolution would allow earlier and more effective engagement in&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy. This would in turn shorten lengths of stay and improve quality of&#xD;
      life. Recently, trans-cranial direct current stimulation with 1-2 mA currents has been&#xD;
      proposed as a potential innovative alternative treatment modality. This stimulation is safe,&#xD;
      easy to use, relatively insensitive to electrode placement, and may have other beneficial&#xD;
      cognitive effects. The stimulation device consists of two electrodes placed on either side of&#xD;
      the head, a unit that provides the stimulation and wires that connect this unit to the&#xD;
      electrodes will be used. The electrodes are held in place with a head band.&#xD;

      Purpose: To determine if using adjunctive TDCS to treat seniors admitted with symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety reduces length of stay and improves quality of life. Hypothesis: Using&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) will decrease length of stay because it will&#xD;
      reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety enabling patients to engage with their therapy&#xD;
      sooner and more effectively. Justification: Anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medications are&#xD;
      often used for this inpatient population but there are many reasons why alternative or&#xD;
      adjunctive treatments may be desirable. Medications can take weeks to become effective, if&#xD;
      they work at all. There are many potential side effects of medications, especially in an&#xD;
      older population, including cognitive and other neurologic impairments. There is also an&#xD;
      increasing resistance to a polypharmacy approach to treatment in this population. A low-risk,&#xD;
      relatively non-invasive, easily applied and well-tolerated treatment to accelerate mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorder resolution would allow earlier and more effective engagement in&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy. This would in turn shorten lengths of stay and improve quality of&#xD;
      life. Objectives: to determine if (1) TDCS reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety and (2)&#xD;
      if patients in the intervention group are discharged from hospital sooner than those in the&#xD;
      sham group. Research Method/Procedure: Direct current of 1.5 milliamp (mA) will be applied&#xD;
      for 20 minutes 5x/week for 3 weeks in a hemispheric montage over the homologous dorso-lateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortices, anodal on the left. The Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital is Canada's&#xD;
      largest freestanding rehabilitation institution with programs and services for all age&#xD;
      groups. Rehabilitation services cover all disciplines from physical, occupational therapy to&#xD;
      social work. Older adults are admitted to 3D and 4C to address issues related to frailty such&#xD;
      as weakness and poor balance which affect ability to undertake activities of daily living.&#xD;
      Most of the services they receive as inpatients come from physical and occupational&#xD;
      therapists with speech therapists and psychologists also available if needed.Patients will be&#xD;
      drawn from these seniors admitted to these 2 geriatrics units, 3D and 4C. Candidates who meet&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria and are interested in the project will be approached by the RA who&#xD;
      is not involved in their care and will seek their consent. Patients will be randomized into&#xD;
      standard care (SoC) plus active TDCS and SoC with sham TDCS. TDCS is unique in that effective&#xD;
      double blind sham conditions can be created. Effectiveness of treatment will be judged&#xD;
      primarily on reduced length of stay with improved Geriatric Depression Score (GDS), Geriatric&#xD;
      Anxiety Score (GAS) and Older Person's Quality of Life (OPQOL) as secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
      We expect that it will take ~8 months to complete the study: 3 months for ethics review, 4&#xD;
      months to enroll 100 of a possible 200 eligible patients and 1 for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention will be judged primarily on its effect on length of stay for this&#xD;
      population. It is our working hypothesis that this intervention will shorten length of stay&#xD;
      by approximately 5 days. It will do this because TDCS will improve depression (GDS less than&#xD;
      5/15) and anxiety symptoms (score less than 9/30) and thus increase motivation and&#xD;
      engagement. Readiness to proceed with therapy is a clinical judgement based on patient&#xD;
      demeanour and GDS made by the Unit team who will be blind with respect to whether the patient&#xD;
      is receiving TDCS or part of the sham group. Data will include: demographics: gender, age and&#xD;
      diagnosis. Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, Geriatric Depression and Quality of Life scales will&#xD;
      be completed within 1 week of admission, and at ~ 3 and 5 weeks (+3 days) after intervention&#xD;
      initiated. Testing will be coordinated with the Unit Occupational Therapist to avoid&#xD;
      duplication or the risk of over testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline group statistics (mean age &amp;, standard deviation, male/female count, diagnostic&#xD;
           frequencies, initial mean &amp; standard deviations of GDS, Geriatric Anxiety Inventory and&#xD;
           Quality of Life scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effect of length of stay: Student t test will be used to determine if there is a&#xD;
           significant difference between the 2 groups, defined as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Changes in Depression, anxiety or quality of life: significant differences from baseline&#xD;
           at 3 and 5 weeks intervals will be assessed based on minimum clinical differences using&#xD;
           a chi squared test.&#xD;
