  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a public health problem: high prevalence;&#xD;
      increasing morbidity and mortality; impact on health costs. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary intervention combining exercise training, therapeutic education,&#xD;
      psychosocial and behavioral interventions. Its effects are beneficial in the short and medium&#xD;
      terms but are limited in time, between 6 and 12 months, for patients who do not pursue&#xD;
      regular physical activity (PA) in post-rehabilitation and who do not adopt behavioral changes&#xD;
      for health, by loss of motivation. Maintaining the long-term benefits acquired during a&#xD;
      short-term PR program is therefore a major issue in the management of COPD. The recent&#xD;
      development of remote rehabilitation is a promising approach that has been studied in few&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized, controlled and multicenter study, we propose to test the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      use of a mobile telerehabilitation solution will allow COPD patients to mainain at long-term&#xD;
      the benefits acquired during a short-temr programm and therfore improve their quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of contraindications for exercise training (neuromuscular disease, orthopedic&#xD;
           cause).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with significant and unstable cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to understand and/or answer questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refusal to use a smartphone or digital device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unable to access an internet connection at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main analysis will be the univariate intention-to-treat analysis of the primary&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary analyzes will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis with intention to treat secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multivariate analysis of the efficiency criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Univariate and multivariate medico - economic cost - utility analyzes, with their&#xD;
           respective sensitivity analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized study with two parallel arms, controlled against standard&#xD;
      chronic care will be multicentric and open.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients included will be patients diagnosed with COPD who are on RR for four weeks in&#xD;
           one of the three centers participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in the study will be offered after verification of the eligibility&#xD;
           criteria, during the 3rd week of the stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The information note will then be provided to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After obtaining consent, the volunteers will be included in the study at the start of&#xD;
           the 4th week and randomized into two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  - Experimental group of 100 patients using the M-Réhab BPCO telerehabilitation solution.&#xD;
           The solution will be provided during the fourth and final week of RR's stay during which&#xD;
           patients will be trained to use all of the solution's features. Patients will carry out&#xD;
           the entire post-rehabilitation using the remote rehabilitation solution and will benefit&#xD;
           from medical assessments by teleconsultation at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months as well as&#xD;
           assessments at 3, 6 and 12 months by filling. electronic auto-questionnaires followed by&#xD;
           a telephone quality control if necessary. A final evaluation at 12 months, by&#xD;
           videoconference, will be carried out at the patient's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group of 100 patients following usual standard chronic care. Patients will&#xD;
           receive during the last week of stay in the center, the usual advice to continue&#xD;
           physical activity and nutritional advice at home. The evaluations at 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
           will be done by electronic filling of auto-questionnaires followed by a telephone&#xD;
           quality control if necessary. A final evaluation at 12 months, by videoconference, will&#xD;
           be carried out at the patient's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the inclusions is 18 months and the follow-up will be carried out over 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
