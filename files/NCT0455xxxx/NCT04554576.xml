    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate patient satisfaction and health status before and&#xD;
      after a 6-week established self-management training program for middle to older age Hispanic&#xD;
      Americans living with chronic musculoskeletal pain in a large, hospital based urban health&#xD;
      maintenance organization. The secondary aim is to evaluate the effects of remote, nonfrequent&#xD;
      healthcare provider feedback for 6 months on health care utilization, health status and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Managing chronic pain in the US costs approximately $635 billion and half of this expenditure&#xD;
      is for joint and arthritis related pain syndromes. Interestingly, compared with non-Hispanic&#xD;
      whites (NHWs), Hispanic Americans (HAs) report significantly lower rates of chronic pain with&#xD;
      consistently higher levels of pain intensity in both population and clinically based studies.&#xD;
      Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) incidence increases with age and the HA aging population&#xD;
      is among the fastest growing segments of the US population. Despite reporting more intense&#xD;
      pain, HA are less likely to seek medical care versus NHWs for acute and chronic pain. Lack of&#xD;
      access, cultural stoicism and an external locust of control are thought to explain why HAs&#xD;
      seek care at a reduced rate. Psychological factors play a significant role in pain&#xD;
      experience, HAs may employ catastrophic thinking and experience more pain related anxiety&#xD;
      which are predictors of exacerbated pain experience. Pain comorbidities may be amenable to&#xD;
      treatment with appropriate, culturally sensitive treatment focusing on enhancing&#xD;
      self-efficacy to manage the complex array of psychological pain comorbidities. There is a&#xD;
      societal impact of undertreating chronic pain in the HA population. While HAs have the lowest&#xD;
      rate of short-term sick usage (&lt;1-2 days), they have the highest rate of long-term sick usage&#xD;
      (&gt;31 days). This increased long-term time off puts HAs at risk of losing their job if the&#xD;
      time off exceeds Family Leave and Medical Act minimums. Lastly, it is well documented, HAs&#xD;
      are hesitant to take strong pain medication and there is conflicting evidence surrounding&#xD;
      taking over-the-counter medications for pain management. There is a need to provide&#xD;
      culturally sensitive, effective chronic pain management treatments for HAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been 5 well designed studies (n=931) demonstrating efficacy of a trans-created&#xD;
      Spanish version of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) for HAs with chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain. CDSMP has demonstrated effectiveness in improving pain intensity,&#xD;
      self-efficacy (SE) and health behaviors in a community setting . The intervention is a&#xD;
      healthcare provider and/or peer led 2.5 hour self-management training session, 1 time per&#xD;
      week for 6 weeks taught in a group setting in Spanish. The program is grounded in Bandura's&#xD;
      Social Cognitive Theory and uses goal setting and problem solving as corner stones to create&#xD;
      a personalized self-management program. Improvements post-intervention in SE predict&#xD;
      sustainability of health behaviors and maintenance of improved health status in the long&#xD;
      term. Additionally, remote non-frequent health care provider feedback has been associated&#xD;
      with maintenance of health behaviors, however this his not been tested in the HA population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility (patient satisfaction and change in&#xD;
      health status) after bringing the CDSMP programming to a large urban hospital based medical&#xD;
      center that does not currently offer a culturally sensitive, self-management training program&#xD;
      in Spanish middle to older age HAs with chronic pain. The secondary aim is to pilot the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an every 6th week phone/video visit feedback visit for 24 months on both&#xD;
      health status and healthcare utilization.&#xD;

Topics covered are: understanding pain, finding resources, mindfulness, pain science, pacing, exercise, relaxation, communication, sex/intimacy, healthy eating, weight and medication management, making treatment decisions and confronting fears.&#xD;
Participants are encouraged to create their own personal health goals and make weekly action plans to meet their personal goals. Each week participants learn new tools and problem-solving techniques to meet their health goals and themes are repeated throughout 6-week period to ensure understanding and integration. Participants are encouraged to problem-solve and ask questions to the group about creating and carrying out their self-management plan.&#xD;
