  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the study drug benralizumab is a safe&#xD;
      treatment that can reduce the skin side effects caused by cancer treatment by reducing the&#xD;
      level of eosinophils in your blood. Reducing the skin side effects of your cancer treatment&#xD;
      may improve quality of life and allow participants to continue to receive their usual cancer&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
