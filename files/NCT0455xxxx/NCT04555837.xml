    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial investigates the best dose and effect of alisertib in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in treating patients with Rb-deficient head and neck squamous cell cancer.&#xD;
      Alisertib may help block the growth of cancer.. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving alisertib in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab may help control Rb-deficient head and neck squamous cell cancer. HPV positive&#xD;
      head and neck cancers are Rb-deficient.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommend phase II dose of the combination of alisertib and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. (Phase I) II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) and progression&#xD;
      free survival (PFS) of patients with recurrent or metastatic Rb-deficient head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with the combination of pembrolizumab and alisertib.&#xD;
      (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of the combination of pembrolizumab and alisertib in patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the overall survival in HNSCC patients treated with the combination of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and alisertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the relationship between pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, baseline&#xD;
      immune and tumor biomarkers and clinical responses in patients treated with alisertib and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine correlations between clinical responses and the effect of the treatment on&#xD;
      human papilloma virus (HPV)-reactive T cells in HPV+ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine correlations between clinical responses and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte&#xD;
      function and T cell repertoire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of alisertib in combination with fixed dose&#xD;
      pembrolizumab followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months.&#xD;
