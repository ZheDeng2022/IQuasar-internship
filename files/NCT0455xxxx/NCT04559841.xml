  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of using a synthetic bone substitute with or&#xD;
      without simvastatin on regenerative surgical treatment of bone defects associated with&#xD;
      peri-implantitis in a 6- months randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 patients diagnosed with peri-implantitis were randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      surgical treatment groups (group I: synthetic bone substitute (NanoBone), group II: NanoBone&#xD;
      with simvastatin). Clinical measurements included probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical&#xD;
      attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI) and mucosal&#xD;
      recession (MR). Radiographic bone fill was evaluated at baseline and after 6- months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study was designed as a prospective single-center, parallel group, 6 month randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial evaluating the effect of a bone substitute; NanoBone® (Artoss GmbH, Rostock,&#xD;
      Germany) (group 1, control group) compared to the same bone substitute with simvastatin&#xD;
      (Corvast 80 mg, Egyphar, Egypt) (group 2, test group) for RST of peri-implantitis. A total of&#xD;
      30 patients suffering from peri-implantitis who needed regenerative treatment of at least one&#xD;
      peri-implant bone defect were selected and only one implant per patient (the most severe) was&#xD;
      evaluated in the treatment groups. The criteria for diagnosing peri-implantitis is based on&#xD;
      the consensus report of the eighth European Workshop on Periodontology [34] ; the presence of&#xD;
      a peri-implant marginal bone loss ≥2 mm based on baseline periapical radiographs after&#xD;
      delivery of the final restoration and bleeding on probing (BOP) and/or suppuration with or&#xD;
      without concomitant deepening of peri-implant pockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and radiographic evaluation were conducted at baseline and 6 months postoperatively.&#xD;
      Grouping was done using a random number table generated by a third party. They were numbered&#xD;
      according to the order of enrolment and assigned to group I or group II. The grouping results&#xD;
      were sealed in an opaque envelope and kept by an independent third party. For each patient,&#xD;
      cards opened immediately before the surgical procedures. Treatment assignment in each patient&#xD;
      was registered by the clinician who assisted in the operations and kept concealed until the&#xD;
      completion of the study.&#xD;
