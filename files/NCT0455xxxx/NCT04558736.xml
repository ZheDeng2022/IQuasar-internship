    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single center phase II clinical trial in which patients with&#xD;
      Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) ) will receive a haploidentical transplantation. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to learn more about newer methods of transplanting blood forming cells donated&#xD;
      by a family member that is not fully matched to the patient. This includes studying the&#xD;
      effects of the chemotherapy, radiation, the transplanted cell product and additional white&#xD;
      blood cell (lymphocyte) infusions on the patient's body, disease and overall survival. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to assess the rate of engraftment at 30 days and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      and event free survival (EFS) at 1 year post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the rate of engraftment at 30 days after TCR αβ+ T-cell-depleted graft&#xD;
           infusion in patients receiving a single dose of post graft infusion cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the overall survival and event free survival at 1-year post transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To calculate the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To calculate the rate of secondary graft rejection at 1-year post transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To calculate the cumulative incidence of viral reactivation (CMV, EBV and adenovirus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune reconstitution after TCR αβ+ T-cell-depleted graft infusion at 1&#xD;
           month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To longitudinally assess the phenotype and epigenetic profile of T-cells in SAA patients&#xD;
           receiving HCT for SAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the phenotype and epigenetic profile of T-cells in DLI administered to SAA&#xD;
           patients post HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To longitudinally assess CD8 T cell differentiation status in SAA patients using an&#xD;
           epigenetic atlas of human CD8 T cell differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effector functions and proliferative capacity of CD8 T cells isolated&#xD;
           from SAA patients before and after DLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantify donor derived Treg cells at different time points in patients received HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine Treg activation status at different stages after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are specific features of the DLI product associated with particular immune repertoire&#xD;
           profiles post-transplant?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How does the diversity and functional profile of the DLI product alter the response to&#xD;
           pathogens in the recipient?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do baseline features of the recipient's innate and adaptive immune cells correlate with&#xD;
           post-transplant immune repertoires and response profiles?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppressant therapy (IST) is the main treatment for SAA for patients who do not have an&#xD;
      HLA-matched sibling donor available for transplant. But some patients with SAA do not respond&#xD;
      to IST and some others relapse after IST. HCT using an unrelated but HLA-matched donor is the&#xD;
      only curative option for these patients but many patients lack a suitable HLA-matched donor.&#xD;
      St Jude is trying to increase donor options for these patients by using novel therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies by combining two widely used of GVHD prophylaxis methods: i) selective T cell&#xD;
      depletion and ii) use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide. This will allow expansion of the&#xD;
      donor pool to include haploidentical donors as well as reduce the risk of GVHD. The goal of&#xD;
      this protocol is to test whether combining these GVHD prophylaxis approaches will allow use&#xD;
      of haploidentical donors, reduce risk of GVHD, reduce transfusion dependence and improve&#xD;
      immune reconstitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study chemotherapy, antibodies and radiation will be given to prepare the body to&#xD;
      receive donor cells. Participants will then be given the donor cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive two types of donor blood cell products - a progenitor blood cell&#xD;
      infusion and then a donor lymphocyte infusion. Both the progenitor blood cell and the donor&#xD;
      lymphocyte infusion will be processed in a laboratory at St. Jude using a machine called the&#xD;
      CliniMACS™.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial, participants will receive a special type of progenitor blood cells&#xD;
      (called TCRαβ- depleted blood cells) from the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the donor progenitor cells have started to grow within the body (engraftment),&#xD;
      participants will receive a second product that contains mature immune cells. These immune&#xD;
      cells called CD45RA-depleted lymphocytes or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) will help fight&#xD;
      infections in the body after the transplant and strengthen the developing immune system.&#xD;
