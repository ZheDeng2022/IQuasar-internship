  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental impairment characterized by persistent&#xD;
      deficits in social communication and interactions. The prevalence figures have increased&#xD;
      rapidly in recent years due to the expansion of diagnostic criteria and increased public&#xD;
      awareness. The clinical presentations of ASD vary to a large extent, and approximately 56% of&#xD;
      children with ASD possess below average intellectual ability (IQ &lt; 85). The intellectual,&#xD;
      verbal, and social ability in this population may greatly influence intervention outcomes.&#xD;
      The social development of children with ASD and comorbid intellectual disability (ID) is not&#xD;
      well understood, and how children with ASD/ID respond to social skill interventions remains&#xD;
      to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musical elements are a part of various behavioral interventions for ASD, however, the effects&#xD;
      of music as interventions for ASD individuals have not been comprehensively examined in Hong&#xD;
      Kong. The proposed study will address limited research evidence on music therapy as an&#xD;
      intervention for social functioning in children with ASD with mild to borderline ID. Music&#xD;
      therapy is a systematic process of intervention, wherein a therapist helps clients promote&#xD;
      their health by using musical experience and relationships that develop through them. In&#xD;
      particular, the investigators will examine whether using music therapy in social skill&#xD;
      intervention provides additional benefits relative to non-musical intervention in a 12-week&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. Pre-treatment neural response of electroencephalograms (EEG) to&#xD;
      social scenes will be used to predict the outcomes of social skill interventions, whereas EEG&#xD;
      responses to music will be used to predict the effectiveness of musical social skill&#xD;
      intervention. If correlation is found, then the long-term goal is to develop individualized&#xD;
      intervention based on pre-treatment markers to maximize treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is social skill intervention using music therapy more effective in enhancing social&#xD;
           interaction than non-musical social skill training for children with ASD and&#xD;
           co-occurring mild/borderline ID?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants with enhanced neural response to social scenes relative to baseline would&#xD;
           be more responsive to social skill interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants with enhanced neural response to preferred music relative to baseline would&#xD;
           be more responsive to music therapy targeting social skill intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental impairment characterized by persistent&#xD;
      deficits in social communication and interactions coupled with restricted and repetitive&#xD;
      patterns of behaviors. The symptoms of ASD appear in early childhood. Given that no known&#xD;
      cure or effective pharmacological intervention for ASD is available, behavioral interventions&#xD;
      that target autism symptoms is the main strategy to support individuals with ASD to be&#xD;
      integrated into school and the society. The choice to examine music in social skill&#xD;
      intervention is motivated by accruing evidence of its potential for therapeutic use for&#xD;
      various clinical populations. For ASD intervention, music has been explored as a medium to&#xD;
      increase social skills in the field of music therapy for some years. Children with ASD and ID&#xD;
      are often described as preoccupied in their own world and may be highly passive and&#xD;
      unresponsive in social situations. The low verbal ability of these children is one limitation&#xD;
      to their participation given that social interactions often involve verbal exchanges. Music&#xD;
      may become a conduit for children whose natural affinity to social interactions is impaired.&#xD;
      Group music making and improvisations encourage initiation and turn-taking behavior in a&#xD;
      non-verbal situation and may be an alternative avenue for social practice. Children with ASD&#xD;
      can learn to tolerate the presence of and physical contact with other people, distinguish&#xD;
      between oneself and others, and practice social behavior in music therapy group activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these claims are supported by data, no conclusive evidence is available that music&#xD;
      therapy is an effective social skill intervention for children with ASD. One hypothesis that&#xD;
      has not been tested is that success in social skill interventions may depend on individual&#xD;
      differences. Autistic symptoms and abilities vary widely among children with ASD, arising&#xD;
      both from different developmental speeds and specific interests. Some individuals may possess&#xD;
      deficits in the areas of restricted interests or repetitive behavior, which results in poor&#xD;
      social skills; however, they are accepting of social interactions. The willingness to seek&#xD;
      out social experiences is the foundation to social skill development because without initial&#xD;
      interests in social behavior, the motivation to attend to the explicit training and modeling&#xD;
      is low. In such cases of social avoidance, cultivation of social interests through other&#xD;
      strategies, such as music making, may be effective. Narrowing down the types of children who&#xD;
      may respond well to a particular type of intervention can facilitate timely and efficient&#xD;
      treatment provision. In this study, the investigators will test quantitative&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (qEEG) signals in response to music and social scenes as predictive&#xD;
      measures of treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous electrophysiological neural activities at rest or when engaged in task can be&#xD;
      measured by qEEG. Spectral analysis is used to decompose qEEG signals across several minutes&#xD;
      into different frequency bands, which are associated with specific functions. The most&#xD;
      consistent pattern of findings in the literature is that individuals with ASD show a U-shaped&#xD;
      pattern of spectral power relative to controls without ASD; that is, excessive power is&#xD;
      observed at low-frequency (delta, 1-3Hz and theta, 4-7Hz) and high-frequency (beta, 13-35Hz&#xD;
      and gamma, &gt;35Hz) bands, but reduced power is detected in middle-range frequency band (alpha,&#xD;
      8-12Hz). The pattern was found with wide topographic distribution, which suggested&#xD;
      abnormalities across multiple brain regions. This finding was reported for children in&#xD;
      different age groups and for individuals with or without comorbid ID. High-frequency bands&#xD;
      have been associated with emotional responses and emotion recognition and may be linked to&#xD;
      such deficits in individuals with ASD. Neural patterns that deviate from age-matched controls&#xD;
      to a greater extent may suggest more severe behavioral symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is typically investigated in relation to emotional response and&#xD;
      motivations, both in clinical and normal populations. Left-lateralized or left-dominant brain&#xD;
      activity has been linked to an approach system where an individual experiences positive&#xD;
      emotions and motivations. In contrast, right-lateralized frontal activity may reflect&#xD;
      negative emotions and intention to withdraw. Reduced alpha power in the left frontal area of&#xD;
      the scalp in individuals with ASD has also been reported. The modulation of FAA has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in neurofeedback training in individuals with ASD to activate their imitation&#xD;
      behaviors; so this measure is hypothesized to predict and be responsive to social skill&#xD;
      interventions. High-functioning individuals with ASD show intact emotional processing when&#xD;
      listening to music, although they demonstrate distinct neural patterns relative to&#xD;
      neurotypical adults, which is interpreted as increased cognitive load and physiological&#xD;
      arousal. Individual preference for music varies within the target group with ASD/ID and may&#xD;
      predict how they respond to social skill intervention using music therapy. Although&#xD;
      self-report rating scales exist for reporting music experience and preference, qEEG measures&#xD;
      may be superior because they index automatic responses to musical stimuli that the target&#xD;
      population of children with ASD/ID may find difficult to understand or express.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG data can be collected with low-cost, commercially available products and take only 5-10&#xD;
      min to set up. Children with ASD and ID are only required to sit still for a few minutes&#xD;
      because no explicit task response is needed. With the relative ease of data collection, this&#xD;
      procedure may be included in routine clinical check-ups. The analyses of these data can help&#xD;
      researchers and clinicians to understand how neural responses in children with ASD are&#xD;
      related to the clinical presentation of ASD symptoms and their social deficits. Such data may&#xD;
      be further compared with those of neurotypical children to elucidate the mechanisms of social&#xD;
      functioning and to improve social skill interventions. With positive validation, these neural&#xD;
      markers can then be used to prescribe the type of intervention that will most likely succeed.&#xD;
