  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a descriptive study designed to evaluate the propensity for hospitalized&#xD;
      pediatric patients treated adequately with Clinolipid or standard of care (Intralipid) from 7&#xD;
      up to 90 days to develop Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency (EFAD). Additionally, this study&#xD;
      design will evaluate the safety and efficacy of using Clinolipid or Intralipid in a pediatric&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
