      The objective of this treatment protocol is to provide guidance to Treating Physicians who&#xD;
      seek access to pegunigalsidase alfa for Fabry patients whose clinical condition, in the&#xD;
      opinion of the Treating Physician, requires treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)&#xD;
      with pegunigalsidase alfa and a) cannot be adequately treated with currently approved FDA&#xD;
      products and/or b) are not able or willing to participate in any of the on-going clinical&#xD;
      trials in the United States.&#xD;
