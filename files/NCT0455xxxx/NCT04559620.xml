    <textblock>
      The early birth of a premature baby can be a devastating and unplanned situation for parents.&#xD;
      Often, their baby cannot be readily held; they can be very sick and fragile. Parents can feel&#xD;
      helpless; bonding may be more difficult, parental control is superseded by medical necessity&#xD;
      and parents can feel tremendous guilt whenever they are unable to be present at their baby's&#xD;
      bedside. The investigators believe that giving parents an opportunity to provide comfort in&#xD;
      the form of the mother's voice, pre-recorded and played to her baby, will improve her feeling&#xD;
      about her baby in the NICU. The investigators hypothesize that playing the mother's recorded&#xD;
      voice to her extremely preterm infant while in the incubator when she cannot be present will&#xD;
      improve the depression, anxiety and stress as well as overall feeling about her baby. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess the change in depression, anxiety and stress with the use of a&#xD;
      validated tool (the DASS21), as a result of the intervention. The investigators will also&#xD;
      assess the improvement of her feelings with a questionnaire () to be administered before and&#xD;
      after the intervention. The investigators predict that her depression, anxiety and stress as&#xD;
      well as positive feeling will increase after the intervention. The investigators also predict&#xD;
      that the infant's vital signs will remain stable and/or improve when the recording is played.&#xD;

      Background Information and Scientific Rationale The AdventHealth Orlando NICU is the first&#xD;
      U.S. hospital to utilize the Babyleo in a clinical setting. Personnel were trained by Dr√§ger&#xD;
      representatives and the units have been in use for over 2 years. During that time, personnel&#xD;
      have not used the Audio Port, located on the back of the bed. The Audio Port allows sound to&#xD;
      be played inside the incubator at no more than 55 dB, which is within the guidelines set&#xD;
      forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics for the target population of this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early birth of a premature baby can be a devastating and unplanned situation for parents.&#xD;
      Often, their baby cannot be readily held; they can be very sick and fragile. Parents can feel&#xD;
      helpless; bonding may be more difficult, parental control is superseded by medical necessity&#xD;
      and parents can feel tremendous guilt whenever they are unable to be present at their baby's&#xD;
      bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will attempt to provide some comfort and control to the parents of&#xD;
      premature infants by implementing this project. Research has shown that when used&#xD;
      appropriately in the premature to term infant population, specific sounds can result in &quot;a&#xD;
      shorter hospital stay, improved feeding skills, improved behavior state and improved&#xD;
      physiological status&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that giving parents an opportunity to provide comfort in the form&#xD;
      of the mother's voice, pre-recorded and played to her baby, will improve her feeling about&#xD;
      her baby in the NICU. As the process of recording the mother's voice will be aided by trained&#xD;
      Music Therapists, parents will also gain knowledge about developmentally appropriate methods&#xD;
      of interacting with their infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consideration also needs to be given to staff education. It has long been ingrained in staff&#xD;
      that &quot;noise&quot; for the premature infant is undesirable and upsetting to their immature nervous&#xD;
      system. While this can be true, studies have shown that appropriate sounds, introduced at the&#xD;
      right time, can aid in brain development and the later acquisition of language. Babies do not&#xD;
      necessarily need to live in a sound-free environment; in the womb, they are continually&#xD;
      exposed to sound. However, staff are very protective of keeping premature infants from&#xD;
      becoming stressed, and so the mention of introducing sound into their quiet incubator causes&#xD;
      a great deal of consternation. Detailed explanation and staff buy-in will be very important&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have shown that providing a recorded maternal voice in the form of&#xD;
      conversation, singing, or book reading to her preterm infant can have significant beneficial&#xD;
      effects. It has been shown that maternal voice exposure results in improved infants'&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory functions, (1-3), relieving pain during noxious procedures (4), improved&#xD;
      circadian rhythms (5), reduced incidence of apnea and bradycardia (6) and overall improvement&#xD;
      of developmental outcomes (7-9). The mother providing her voice to her fetus during the third&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy also has beneficial effects on her own anxiety and depression (10,11).&#xD;
      Several studies have shown the safety and feasibility of introducing sound into an incubator&#xD;
      (14,15,16). However, other studies have introduced music into the incubator via speakers,&#xD;
      headphones or an audio player with loudspeakers (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to use the Babyleo's built-in audio port. The mother will record an&#xD;
      audio CD with the guidance of Music Therapy. This will be played on a CD player for no more&#xD;
      than 30 minutes at a time, 4 times a day. The recorder is plugged in to the audio port by a&#xD;
      standard cable from the headset port of the CD player.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective/Aim/Goal/Hypothesis Preterm birth is associated with a higher rate of&#xD;
      postpartum depression disorders (17,18,19,20). This is in part due to feeling of &quot;let down&quot;&#xD;
      because the mothers are unable to care for her baby and has to leave the baby in the NICU for&#xD;
      care. The &quot;let down&quot; feeling may be lessened if mothers are given the opportunity to express&#xD;
      their concern by producing a recording for their babies. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      playing the mother's recorded voice to her extremely preterm infant while in the incubator&#xD;
      when she cannot be present will improve the depression, anxiety and stress as well as overall&#xD;
      feeling about her baby. The study team will assess the change in depression, anxiety and&#xD;
      stress with the use of a validated tool (the DASS21), as a result of the intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will also assess the improvement of her feelings with a questionnaire () to be&#xD;
      administered before and after the intervention. The investigators predict that her&#xD;
      depression, anxiety and stress as well as positive feeling will increase after the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective/Aim/Goal/Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The infant's vital signs will remain stable and/or improve when the recording is played.&#xD;
           Vital signs for the purpose of this study will be defined as; heart rate and respiratory&#xD;
           rate. Blood pressure and temperature will be recorded if available. Vital signs will be&#xD;
           assessed both before the recording and during the recording. Over time, the study team&#xD;
           predicts vital signs will remain within acceptable parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Playing mother's voice will reduce the incidence of apnea, bradycardia and desaturation&#xD;
           of the study infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Research Design This is a randomized, prospective clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Intervention Description As shown in the diagram below, maternal consent will be&#xD;
      obtained during the first week of life and the baby will be randomized as shown in the&#xD;
      diagram below. Group 1 mothers' voice will be played between week 2 and 3 while group 2&#xD;
      mothers' voice will be played after week 3 but no research data will be collected. Group 2&#xD;
      will therefore serve as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between consent and the infant reaching two weeks of life, the mother will be given time to&#xD;
      acclimate to having a child in the NICU, and to adjust to the fact that she has delivered&#xD;
      early and not at term. After seven days and prior to meeting with the music therapist, she&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the DASS21 and the questionnaire that expresses her feelings about&#xD;
      her baby in the NICU. Surveys will be completed in Survey Monkey on a research department&#xD;
      tablet or via the mother's own electronic device. She will then work closely with Music&#xD;
      Therapy staff, receiving education about appropriate developmental sound for her baby and to&#xD;
      record her voice on a CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those who have been randomized to receive the intervention, the mother's recorded voice&#xD;
      will be played via the incubator's audio port. At week three (+2 days), the DASS21 and&#xD;
      feeling questionnaire will be repeated for both groups. Both groups will then be allowed to&#xD;
      play the recording within guidelines, but no further research data will be collected. Staff&#xD;
      education will be conducted by research personnel and selected staff members (Ambassadors).&#xD;
      Ambassadors will also facilitate playing of the recording, particularly on night shift, to&#xD;
      assist with parent education and to support staff efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will approach the parents of babies born at 260/7 to 306/7 weeks gestation and&#xD;
      explain the project, asking for permission to participate and obtaining consent. A Parent&#xD;
      Education Sheet, prepared by the Developmental Committee, will be given to each participating&#xD;
      family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical data, including mother's age, race, level of education, and infant's&#xD;
      gestation, gender, birth weight, Apgar score, ventilatory support, and IVH, will be collected&#xD;
      from the medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the guidance of the Music Therapy Department, the mother will create a sound recording,&#xD;
      which could include any and all of the following: the mother's heartbeat, the mother speaking&#xD;
      to her child (i.e., reading a book, expressing her love and hopes for the future), the mother&#xD;
      singing to her child, etc. Mother can choose the subject matter. She can also choose from a&#xD;
      list of available books/songs. The recordings will be played for the infant for 1 week as&#xD;
      intervention, when visitors are not present. The recording will be 30 minutes long, and will&#xD;
      be played four times a day, at a time the clinical team determines is appropriate for that&#xD;
      baby. There will be a 30-minute period of silence after the recording. A cord is inserted&#xD;
      into the headphone port of the CD player and then into the Babyleo Audio Port, which is the&#xD;
      same type of port as the headphone port (male/male connector). The set-up will be done by a&#xD;
      member of the research team, the bedside RN simply has to push play. Data will be collected&#xD;
      regarding the infant's tolerance for the recording. Vital signs will be recorded during the&#xD;
      study intervention 30 minutes before the recording is played and then once during the&#xD;
      intervention. The incidence of daily ABDs (apnea, bradycardia, desaturations) are routinely&#xD;
      documented in the EMR and will be obtained from the medical record: A. Apnea for &gt; 20&#xD;
      seconds, B. Heart rate &lt; 80 beats per minute C. Oxygen saturations &lt;80 The study team expect&#xD;
      that the incidence of ABDs will decrease by the end of the intervention, although changes in&#xD;
      ABDs may be multifactorial and influenced by increased maturity, level of illness or&#xD;
      respiratory status.The infant's nurse may, at his/her discretion, discontinue playing the&#xD;
      recording for any reason. While multiple studies have shown the safety of introducing voice&#xD;
      to the premature baby, if the infant has 3 ABDs during 3 consecutive interventions, the&#xD;
      infant will be taken off the study. When the infant comes out of the incubator and into a&#xD;
      crib, the study team can give the parent the recording via CD or audio file (mp3 or mp4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site(s)/Location(s) and Number of Subjects This study will take place at the&#xD;
      AdventHealth Orlando NICU. Sample size will be calculated using the DASS21 (our primary&#xD;
      outcome) of the first ten mothers enrolled in the study. The investigators will aim for a 30%&#xD;
      relative increase in Feeling score with 80% power Plan.&#xD;
