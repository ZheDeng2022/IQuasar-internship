      Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of gastric per oral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) in&#xD;
      the treatment of gastroparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints Primary endpoint: Clinical Efficacy Will be assessed by measurements of&#xD;
      Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptoms Index (GCSI) score, Patient Assessment of Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Disorders Symptom Severity Index (PAGI-SYM) and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).&#xD;
      Outcome criteria will be measured at baseline, 1 month, 5 months, 7 months and 12 months.&#xD;
      These criteria will be the mean total GCSI score, and SF-36 score based on the values&#xD;
      recorded with a Likert scale. GES parameters will be the half gastric emptying time and the&#xD;
      RPH2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: Safety Safety will be characterized by the incidence of all Adverse&#xD;
      Device Effects (ADEs), non-serious and serious, possibly related to or related to the&#xD;
      procedure and/or device that are experienced by study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, safety assessments will be determined based on physical examination (vital&#xD;
      signs) and laboratory tests during scheduled visits. Safety evaluations will also be&#xD;
      performed to ensure no subsequent adverse events have occurred and to ensure any adverse&#xD;
      events during the trial that are considered on-going are stable or have resolved. Safety will&#xD;
      be assessed at 1 month, 5 months, 7 months and 12 months following the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary endpoints will be technical success, nutritional status assessed by the&#xD;
      measurement of the BMI, pre-albumin and albumin levels and for diabetics the HbA1c. These&#xD;
      criteria will be measured at baseline, 1 month, 5 months, 7 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design This will be a prospective, sham-randomized, monocentric, interventional,&#xD;
      efficacy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once baseline eligibility criteria have been met, a first endoscopy under general anesthesia&#xD;
      is proposed to the patients. Patients will be randomized blindly in a 1/1 fashion design&#xD;
      between the sham arm and the GPOEM arm. At the time of the general anesthesia, a sealed&#xD;
      envelope will be opened. Subjects will have a second endoscopy under general anesthesia 6&#xD;
      months later and the sham arm will then beneficiate from a GPOEM procedure and the GPOEM arm&#xD;
      a sham procedure. Then, all the patients will be followed for another 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCSI score, PAGI-SYM, SF36 will be collected at screening, 1,5,7 and 12 months. GES RPH2,&#xD;
      RPH4 and half emptying time will be collected at screening, 5 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description procedure in the GPOEM arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be performed under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation in&#xD;
      supine position. GPOEM is performed with the following steps: -i: submucosal injection; -ii:&#xD;
      mucosal incision upstream the pylorus followed by submucosal tunneling; -iii:&#xD;
      antropyloromyotomy; -iv: closure of the tunnel access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description procedure in the SHAM arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnostic upper digestive tract endoscopy will be performed under general anesthesia with&#xD;
      tracheal intubation in supine position, injection of 1 cc of saline at four quadrants of the&#xD;
      pylorus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative management Once the patients recovered from anesthesia after the procedure,&#xD;
      they were administrated analgesics and anti-emetics as needed and esomeprazole 80 mg daily&#xD;
      systematically to protect the mucosal access and tunnel from ulceration. Patients will be&#xD;
      kept fasted for the first postoperative day (POD 1). In the absence of adverse events,&#xD;
      patients will be allowed to resume liquid oral intake for 1 day, a soft-ground diet for 2&#xD;
      additional days, and finally a normal diet. They will be discharged after POD 1 in the&#xD;
      absence of adverse events, with a prescription of esomeprazole 40 mg daily by mouth for 1&#xD;
      month and dietary instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months, another endoscopy under general anesthesia will be performed with the SHAM&#xD;
      and GPOEM arms are interchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the G-POEM / SHAM procedure, all patients will be rigorously evaluated in the same&#xD;
      fashion. They will be assessed clinically before being discharged (POD 1) and then at 1 month&#xD;
      and 5 months after the intervention with a clinical examination that included determination&#xD;
      of the severity of the symptoms and total GCSI score, PAGI-SYM, SF-36. A GES will be&#xD;
      performed at 5 months and 12 months.&#xD;
