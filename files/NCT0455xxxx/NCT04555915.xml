      In course of the SafeBoosC III trial, we would like to analyse routinely performed GMA as&#xD;
      secondary outcome parameter in an ancillary observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First aim is to analyse in surviving neonates included into the SafeboosC III trial any&#xD;
      differences between the experimental group group and control group in Global-GMA at term age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second aim is to investigate GMOS at term age and if available GMA at 9-16 weeks corrected&#xD;
      age.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE In course of the SafeBoosC III trial, we would like to analyse routinely performed&#xD;
      GMA as as secondary outcome parameter in an ancillary observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First aim is to analyse in surviving neonates included into the SafeboosC III trial any&#xD;
      differences between the experimental group group and control group in Global-GMA at term age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second aim is to investigate GMOS at term age and if available GMA at 9-16 weeks corrected&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES We hypothesise that the surviving preterm neonates in the experimental group of&#xD;
      the SafeBoosC III trial show better results in Global-GMA at term age compared to surviving&#xD;
      neonates in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we hypothesise that the surviving preterm neonates in the experimental group of&#xD;
      the SafeBoosC III trial show better results in GMOS at term age and in GMA if available at&#xD;
      9-16 weeks corrected age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Trial design It will be a pilot observational ancillary study to the SafeBoosC III&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Preterm neonates included in SafeBoosC III trial are eligible to be included in&#xD;
      this ancillary study. Neonates will be included, in whom GM assessment is performed routinely&#xD;
      at corrected term age or before discharge and optionally at a corrected age between 9 to 16&#xD;
      weeks. The infants are recorded according to routine after feeding, during periods of active&#xD;
      wakefulness and lying in a supine position for 10-20 minutes. To evaluate the GMA visual&#xD;
      Prechtl Gestalt perception are used. Because of the routine use in GMA, handling should reach&#xD;
      the quality parameters, necessary for an optimal interpretation of these results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary outcome measure for this ancillary observational study will be&#xD;
      Global-GMA at term age Secondary outcome measure for this ancillary observational study will&#xD;
      be GMOS at term age and if available GMA at a corrected age between 9 to 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Interpretation of Global-GMA and GMOS will be performed by analysing&#xD;
      pseudo-anonymised video-recordings by persons trained in GMA and not involved in the care of&#xD;
      the neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GMA Data Global GMA will be classified as normal and abnormal (poor repertoire, chaotic,&#xD;
      cramped synchronised at term age/absent fidgety movements at corrected age of 9-16 weeks).&#xD;
      GMOS will be scored from zero to 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data managing plan Demographic data will be handled according the data managing plan of the&#xD;
      SafeboosC III protocol in its latest version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GMA and GMOS data will be anonymised at each centre participating in this ancillary study&#xD;
      with the local patient ID used in the SafeboosC III trial and handled according to local&#xD;
      guidelines. Local statistical analyses will be performed in each participating centre in this&#xD;
      ancillary study and just the results of these statistical analyses will be transferred to&#xD;
      Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria for overall/meta-analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Baseline characteristics of neonates will be given as mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation or median and interquartile range for continuous data and as numbers and&#xD;
      percentages for categorical data. Comparison of baseline characteristics will be done by&#xD;
      using t-Test or Mann Whitney U-test for continuous data and Chi-square test or Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test for categorical data. To answer the primary hypothesis whether global GMA differ between&#xD;
      neonates of the control group and neonates of the intervention group OR will be calculated&#xD;
      within each center. To analyze the secondary outcome measure GOMS a modified version of&#xD;
      Agresti's (1980) generalized odds ratio (genOR), which accounts for ties, will be calculated&#xD;
      within each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      genOR=(Prob(Y_1&lt;Y_2))/(Prob(Y_1&gt;Y_2)) Since data are collected in the same study and&#xD;
      therefore the study designs are the same, we assume the treatment effect to be the same and&#xD;
      differences in the results between centers are due to a random error. As a consequence data&#xD;
      will be combined using fixed effect models. Overall OR for the global GMA and the GOMS will&#xD;
      be calculated and Forest plots drawn.&#xD;
