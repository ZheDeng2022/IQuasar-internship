  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Shauriana intervention, developed from qualitative work using a community-based&#xD;
      participatory approach, aims to integrate PrEP, sexual health, and mental health support for&#xD;
      gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in Kenya. This study consists of a brief&#xD;
      pilot test phase with 10 participants, followed by a randomized, controlled trial with 60&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are at high risk for HIV-1&#xD;
      acquisition, especially in rights-constrained settings such as Kenya, where men's access to&#xD;
      HIV prevention has been impeded by homophobia, stigma, and discrimination. Pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to greatly reduce HIV acquisition risk in this key&#xD;
      population if accessible, sustainable PrEP programming with tailored, effective adherence&#xD;
      support can be provided. To this end, close collaboration between PrEP program implementers&#xD;
      and GBMSM-led community-based organizations is essential. Based on preliminary qualitative&#xD;
      work, this theory-based and culturally relevant PrEP support intervention is called Shauriana&#xD;
      (Kiswahili for &quot;we counsel each other&quot;). The Shauriana intervention merges peer navigation&#xD;
      and &quot;integrated Next Step Counseling&quot; (iNSC) to promote sexual health protection strategies,&#xD;
      including PrEP uptake and adherence, among GBMSM in Kisumu. The present proposal aims to&#xD;
      pilot the intervention among 10 participants for 3 months, and then to evaluate the Shauriana&#xD;
      intervention for acceptability, feasibility, safety, and estimated effect on PrEP uptake and&#xD;
      adherence, compared to standard of care, in a small randomized, controlled study with 60&#xD;
      participants followed for 6 months after enrollment. Results of the proposed research will&#xD;
      have high impact by ensuring GBMSM involvement in the scale-up of effective PrEP programming&#xD;
      for this key population in Kenya and providing a peer-led PrEP support model for GBMSM and&#xD;
      other vulnerable and marginalized populations in African settings.&#xD;

    <description>The Shauriana intervention is aimed at promoting sexual health and preventing HIV through a comprehensive prevention toolbox including PrEP. Components of this intervention are: four weekly in-person sessions with a trained peer intervention specialist; optional additional in-person or by phone check-ins after the in-person sessions are delivered; and optional monthly group sessions.</description>

    <description>Standard care includes clinic-based HIV counseling and testing, screening for symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (STI), and individual counseling about HIV prevention methods. Standard of care counseling for HIV prevention in Kenya includes general information about HIV transmission and discussions of risk reduction including condom use. PrEP counseling sessions focus on PrEP knowledge, adherence tips, and strategies to address adherence barriers.</description>

    <description>The components of this intervention are: four weekly in-person sessions with a trained peer intervention specialist; optional additional in-person or by phone check-ins after the in-person sessions are delivered; and optional monthly group sessions. The four in-person health education and coaching sessions will be delivered once per week, by trained peer facilitators who identify as GBMSM. These sessions will focus on the following topics: sexual health basics (understanding how HIV and STIs are transmitted, prevented, and diagnosed/treated), relationships (types of relationships we have, characteristics of healthy relationships, communication skills), stress and coping (understanding mental health challenges, adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies), and healthy sexuality and empowerment (understanding sexual orientation and gender identity, challenging stereotypes about GBMSM, making sexual choices).</description>
