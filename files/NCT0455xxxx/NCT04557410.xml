  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease that causes the death of upper and lower&#xD;
      motor neurons. ALS symptoms are characterized by stiffness, muscle twitching, and worsening&#xD;
      weakness due to muscle breakdown. Onset of symptoms are typically arm or leg weakness or&#xD;
      difficulty speaking or swallowing and gradual development of overall body weakness. The cause&#xD;
      is unknown and there is no cure for ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poly MVA was found to substantially lower fatigue and improve quality of life in a pilot&#xD;
      study of patients with varied medical disorders. The reduction in fatigue was also observed&#xD;
      in a small series of patients enrolled in an open label study for patients with gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we want to find out more about a dietary supplement, called Poly MVA (also&#xD;
      called the study drug in this form), for people with ALS. We want to find out if Poly MVA&#xD;
      reduces the symptoms of fatigue and depression when taken daily. The supplement contains&#xD;
      vitamins, minerals and amino acids (proteins) and has been used by patients with other&#xD;
      medical conditions to help with their fatigue and quality of life.&#xD;

      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease that causes the death of upper and lower&#xD;
      motor neurons. ALS symptoms are characterized by stiffness, muscle twitching, and worsening&#xD;
      weakness due to muscle breakdown. Onset of symptoms are typically arm or leg weakness or&#xD;
      difficulty speaking or swallowing and gradual development of overall body weakness. The cause&#xD;
      is unknown and there is no cure for ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poly MVA is a dietary supplement which contains a uniquely formulated combination of&#xD;
      minerals, vitamins, and amino acids designed to promote cellular energy production. The&#xD;
      active molecule in this supplement is Palladium Lipoic Acid (PdLA) complex. This compound is&#xD;
      synthesized using a process whereby palladium (a rare metal, which is found in the food&#xD;
      chain- we consume approximately 2 ng/day is chemically bound to alpha lipoic acid, a powerful&#xD;
      anti-oxidant involved in cellular energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poly MVA was found to substantially lower fatigue and improve quality of life in a pilot&#xD;
      study of patients with varied medical disorders. The reduction in fatigue was also observed&#xD;
      in a small series of patients enrolled in an open label study for patients with gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To test the efficacy of PolyMVA as a treatment for ALS fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the specificity of the fatigue reducing effect of Poly-MVA by&#xD;
      controlling for mood, disease severity, and cognitive status&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, prospective study which evaluates the response of 4 teaspoons of Poly&#xD;
      MVA taken daily, over a 24-Week interval.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be assessed for fatigue using the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - Respiratory (ALSFRS-R), a 12-item scale with possible scores ranging from 0 - 48 where 0 = total dependence and 48 = normal function.</description>

    <description>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), a 21-item rating scale with total scores ranging from 0 - 64 where the highest score reflects a greater impact of fatigue on a person's daily activity.

    <description>Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a scoring system used by the investigator based on a 10-item clinical interview moving from broadly phrased questions about symptoms to more detailed ones which allow a precise rating of severity. The rating are either given based on defined scale steps (0, 2, 4, 6) or between them (1,3,5), where higher scores indicate more severe depression (possible score is 0 - 60).</description>
