    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, multi-center clinical study to determine the safety, Maximum&#xD;
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Optimal Biological Dose (OBD) as well as the optimal schedule for&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) and/or subcutaneous (SC) administrations of RO7293583 with or without&#xD;
      obinutuzumab pretreatment, in participants with unresectable metastatic TYRP1-positive&#xD;
      melanomas who have progressed on standard of care (SOC) treatment, are intolerant to SOC, or&#xD;
      are non-amenable to SOC. This study will include an initial single participant&#xD;
      dose-escalation part one followed by a multiple participant dose-escalation part two with the&#xD;
      possibility of expansion.&#xD;

    <description>Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) were reported according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0), except for Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which will be graded based on the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed objective response (OR). Confirmed OR is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions â‰¥ 4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.</description>

    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). Per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study including baseline, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the first occurrence of documented OR to disease progression, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study including baseline; or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
