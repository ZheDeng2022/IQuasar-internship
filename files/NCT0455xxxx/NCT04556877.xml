    <textblock>
      In intensive care patients, high intraabdominal pressure is frequently encountered.&#xD;
      Intra-abdominal pressure is often measured as high, especially after major abdominal surgery&#xD;
      procedures. In recent years, various studies have reported that the increase in optic nerve&#xD;
      diameter measured by ultrasound correlates with the level of intracranial pressure. Optic&#xD;
      nerve diameter measurement with ultrasound is a non-invasive procedure. Intra-abdominal&#xD;
      pressure measurements are also routinely performed in intensive care patients. In the&#xD;
      measurement of abdominal pressure, the bladder catheter, which is already available in every&#xD;
      patient who comes to intensive care, is used. In this study, the intra-abdominal pressure&#xD;
      values present in the file of each patient undergoing major abdominal surgery who were taken&#xD;
      to intensive care unit will be taken. Orbital USG will be performed on the 6th, 12th and 24th&#xD;
      hours on admission to the intensive care unit to measure the diameter of the optic nerve, and&#xD;
      the relationship between the intra-abdominal pressure value and optic nerve diameters will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

      In intensive care patients, high intraabdominal pressure is frequently encountered.&#xD;
      Intra-abdominal pressure is often measured as high, especially after major abdominal surgery&#xD;
      procedures. This situation creates ischemia in the abdominal organs in the patient, decreases&#xD;
      venous return as a result of inferior vena cava compression and leads to a decrease in&#xD;
      cardiac output. In addition, intracranial pressure frequently increases as a result of the&#xD;
      venous circulation being affected. In recent years, various studies have reported that the&#xD;
      increase in optic nerve diameter measured by ultrasound correlates with the level of&#xD;
      intracranial pressure. Optic nerve diameter measurement with ultrasound is a non-invasive&#xD;
      procedure. Intra-abdominal pressure measurements are also routinely performed in intensive&#xD;
      care patients. In the measurement of abdominal pressure, the bladder catheter, which is&#xD;
      already available in every patient who comes to intensive care, is used. In this study, the&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure values present in the file of each patient undergoing major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery who were taken to intensive care unit will be taken. Orbital USG will be&#xD;
      performed on the 6th, 12th and 24th hours on admission to the intensive care unit to measure&#xD;
      the diameter of the optic nerve, and the relationship between the intra-abdominal pressure&#xD;
      value and optic nerve diameters will be investigated.&#xD;
