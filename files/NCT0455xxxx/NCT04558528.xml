    <textblock>
      In this study, a prospective evaluation of novel malaria diagnostic tools under development&#xD;
      will be performed in malaria-endemic countries to assess their clinical performance for&#xD;
      detection of malaria at point-of-care (POC). This study aims to support product development&#xD;
      efforts and aims to provide early stage (TLR~5) technology developers with valuable&#xD;
      information on performance and basic feasibility data that can help to accelerate&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
