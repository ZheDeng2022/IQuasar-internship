  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care units (ICU) provide life-saving care for nearly five million people annually.&#xD;
      Up to 80% of patients receiving care in an ICU experience at least one episode of delirium.&#xD;
      Delirium, an acute episodic display of confused thinking and unawareness, predicts impaired&#xD;
      cognition and accelerated cognitive decline which negatively impacts quality of life (QOL)&#xD;
      long after hospital discharge. The average age of ICU patients is 52 years. These middle-age&#xD;
      (MA) ICU survivors need cognitive interventions that are well planned, accessible, and&#xD;
      effective to improve cognition and prevent accelerated decline so they can resume their&#xD;
      previous QOL and enter older age with optimized cognitive function. Physical exercise and&#xD;
      cognitive training independently improve cognition and emerging evidence indicates that&#xD;
      combining these two approaches produces even greater effects on cognition. Community-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation centers are accessible for MAICU survivors to engage in physical activity;&#xD;
      cognitive training could easily be added. Approaches in which a patient engages in physical&#xD;
      exercise and cognitive training concurrently is an understudied intervention for all ICU&#xD;
      survivors, especially those who are middle-aged. Study aims are to investigate the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of a simultaneous recumbent cycling and cognitive training&#xD;
      intervention (SRCCT) for MAICU survivors who experienced at least one delirium episode during&#xD;
      their ICU stay. Feasibility will be determined by systematically evaluating research team&#xD;
      training, participant recruitment, randomization, implementation, and intervention fidelity.&#xD;
      Acceptability will be evaluated via a satisfaction, preferences, burden, and&#xD;
      participant-suggested improvements survey. The SRCCT effect sizes will be calculated&#xD;
      comparing multiple data point cognition scores between an SRCCT group and a usual care&#xD;
      control group. Upon completion, investigators expect to understand the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the SRCCT delivered in community-based rehabilitation centers, and the&#xD;
      combined effect of SRCCT on cognition and QOL for middle-aged ICU survivors who experienced&#xD;
      an episode of ICU delirium. The hypothesis is that study participants who engage in physical&#xD;
      exercise and cognitive training concurrently will have a greater improvement in cognition and&#xD;
      QOL than physical exercise training alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a 2-year RCT, single-masked (participants), pilot feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability study, with repeated measures to compare SRCCT to usual care on cognition and&#xD;
      QOL in MA, ICU survivors who experienced at least one episode of delirium in an ICU and have&#xD;
      mild to moderate cognitive impairment. The SRCCT will include 12 weeks of simultaneous&#xD;
      recumbent bicycling and cognitive training delivered at the same time in a rehabilitation&#xD;
      center followed by a 6-month maintenance phase when no intervention will be delivered.&#xD;
      Cognitive training will be administered via the POSIT Science (TM) Brain HQ computer-based&#xD;
      program. At 12, 24, and 36 weeks post-baseline, cognition will be measured using Montreal&#xD;
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and PROMIS Cognitive Function Abilities SF8a (PRO Cog), and QOL&#xD;
      will be assessed using PROMIS Global-10 Health Short Form (PGH-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and Study Population: The study will take place in two large, urban health care&#xD;
      systems in Kansas City, Missouri: St. Luke's Hospital (SLH) and Truman Medical Center (TMC).&#xD;
      St. Luke's Hospital is located in downtown Kansas City with 600 staff physicians practicing&#xD;
      in 60 specialty areas. This centrally located hospital has 77 ICU beds. Truman Medical Center&#xD;
      is the safety net hospital for the Kansas City area and has 41 ICU beds. The rehabilitation&#xD;
      centers employ healthcare staff who work with outpatients who are deconditioned and&#xD;
      recovering from hospitalization. Data provided by SLH and TMC indicate an adequate pool for&#xD;
      study recruitment. In 2018, 87 MA patients were admitted to TMC ICUs; 1366 were admitted to&#xD;
      SLH ICUs. Combined ICU admissions age 45-64 were 1453 and 12% (174) experienced delirium&#xD;
      (using CAM-ICU). Given 79% (138) of patients who have ICU delirium experience cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and recruitment rate of 75%, there are 103 ICU survivors possible and therefore&#xD;
      the recruitment goal of 50 participants for this study is achievable. Fifty patients meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be recruited and enrolled.The final patient sample will comprise 50&#xD;
      MA ICU survivors who have had at least one episode of delirium in the ICU and have mild to&#xD;
      moderate cognitive impairment (using MoCA). Registered Nurses (RN) from SLH and TM CICUs will&#xD;
      identify and HIPAA-consent patients who meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once&#xD;
      consented, the RN will notify the study Research Assistant (RA). After discharge from the ICU&#xD;
      to a hospital room, the RA will meet with the patient to explain the study and obtain&#xD;
      consent. Once consented, the RA will contact the PI's who will determine random assignment to&#xD;
      either treatment (SRCCT) or usual care. Block randomization will be created using a&#xD;
      computer-generated list of random numbers blocked into balanced groups of four. Before&#xD;
      recruitment begins, the RAs will practice the consent process in simulated situations with&#xD;
      PIs. Rapport will be maintained by pairing RAs and participants for the duration of the&#xD;
      intervention thereby enhancing retention. Investigators anticipate low attrition but&#xD;
      recognize participants may withdraw 1) on the advice of their healthcare provider or for&#xD;
      other health reasons, 2) due to changes in life circumstances, or 3) loss of interest in the&#xD;
      study. In such cases, the RAs will document the event and notify the PIs who will track all&#xD;
      withdrawals. Patients who are randomized to the SRCCT intervention treatment group will be&#xD;
      screened and consented after transition from ICU into their hospital room. The SRCCT will&#xD;
      begin approximately two weeks after discharge to home. The intervention was developed by Dr.&#xD;
      Lasiter (Co-PI and Critical Care nurse), Dr. Chrisman (Co-PI and physical activity&#xD;
      interventionist), and Dr. Russell (Co-I and feasibility/acceptability/RCT expert) and will be&#xD;
      administered by Drs. Lasiter and Chrisman, and two trained RAs. A rehabilitation center RN&#xD;
      will monitor the participant's condition while engaged in the SRCCT or usual care. Dr.&#xD;
      Lasiter and Dr. Chrisman will oversee the intervention protocol. Research assistants who are&#xD;
      baccalaureate and master's-prepared RNs experienced in RCT studies will undergo training by&#xD;
      Drs. Lasiter, Chrisman, and Russell, including the following components: 1) project rationale&#xD;
      and overview; 2) detailed information on the SRCCT intervention and usual care; 3) scripts&#xD;
      for use when consenting and collecting data; 4) how to use Research Electronic Data Capture&#xD;
      (REDCap) database (redcap.umkc.edu); 5) detailed training on administering study instruments&#xD;
      (MoCA requires training before permission is granted to use the instrument), and 6) using a&#xD;
      tablet. Simulation and role-play will be used until the RAs are consistently applying the&#xD;
      protocol as judged by investigators. To ensure the highest level of RA protocol knowledge and&#xD;
      skills, the training sessions will also include role-playing of disruptive situations for the&#xD;
      intervention. To monitor RA intervention fidelity, a fidelity protocol checklist will be used&#xD;
      during all participant encounters to document key elements of the protocol, including number&#xD;
      of intervention sessions, session duration, length of time between sessions, and intervention&#xD;
      steps. Each element will be rated as completed, partially completed, not completed, or N/A.&#xD;
      Field notes will be kept for every encounter. Participants randomized into the usual care arm&#xD;
      will receive scheduled follow-up office appointments with their provider post-discharge at&#xD;
      which time a member of the study team will administer the scheduled study measures at&#xD;
      specific time points. The usual care group will not receive SRCCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses: Drs. Lasiter, Chrisman and Staggs (biostatistician) will conduct analyses.&#xD;
      Feasibility will be tracked using checklists for 1) educating nursing staff about inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and HIPAA consent, 2) educating RAs about interpersonal communication, recruitment,&#xD;
      consent, intervention procedures and fidelity and, 3) guiding the intervention to insure&#xD;
      fidelity between sites and study staff/investigators. Acceptability will be evaluated by&#xD;
      assessing four domains: participant satisfaction, participant preferences, participant&#xD;
      burden, and suggestions for improvement. Limitations: One limitation is that the study will&#xD;
      not include exercise-only or cognitive-only training groups. Literature supports that each is&#xD;
      effective independently and, rather than isolate their effects, investigators will examine&#xD;
      combined effects which has the potential to be synergistic in efficacy. Potential difficulty&#xD;
      may be recruitment; if recruitment difficulty occurs, investigators will consult with the&#xD;
      study team and study site contacts to potentially widen the scope of recruiting participants,&#xD;
      add a third study site, or hire an RA who closely matches the ages of the study sample.&#xD;
      Another potential difficulty is low retention, and/or patient mortality. To minimize&#xD;
      attrition, an honoraria will be provided for each data collection time point. Although&#xD;
      mortality in MA ICU survivors is higher than in the general MA population, investigators do&#xD;
      not expect mortality to have a major effect on retention in this 36-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses Plan: Descriptive statistics (e.g., standardized mean difference) will be used&#xD;
      to compare the intervention and control groups on selected patient characteristics and adjust&#xD;
      for meaningful imbalances on any variables by including them as covariates in statistical&#xD;
      modeling. In the focal analysis investigators will assess the effect of the SRCCT&#xD;
      intervention on each of the three Aim 1 outcome measures at T3 by fitting three ANCOVA models&#xD;
      with the T3 measurement as the dependent variable, the baseline measurement (T2) as a&#xD;
      covariate, and group (intervention vs. control) as an explanatory variable. In secondary&#xD;
      analyses the intervention effect at T4 and T5 will be assessed analogously. If the usual&#xD;
      linear modeling assumption of Normal residuals is not met, investigators will either&#xD;
      transform the dependent variable, fit an appropriate generalized linear model, or obtain&#xD;
      confidence limits and p-values by non-parametric bootstrapping. Power and precision of&#xD;
      estimation for the ANCOVA model described above were assessed using a simulation study. For&#xD;
      each of 1,000 simulated data sets, investigators randomly generated Normal T2 scores and then&#xD;
      used these to generate Normal T3 scores, assuming a strong intervention effect of 0.5 SDs and&#xD;
      a correlation of 0.7 between T2 and T3 scores within each arm (implying roughly 50% of&#xD;
      variability in T3 scores can be explained by T2 scores). In keeping with the exploratory&#xD;
      nature of this aim, power was estimated to detect a non-zero intervention effect with a&#xD;
      one-sided test at α = 0.10. The average length of the 90% confidence interval for the&#xD;
      intervention effect across the simulated data sets was computed. Estimated power was 86%, and&#xD;
      confidence intervals averaged 0.68 SDs in length (equivalent to an average margin of error of&#xD;
      0.34 SDs). Actual power will depend on the true intervention effect size and true correlation&#xD;
      between T2 and T3 scores, both of which are unknown; however, in this preliminary effort to&#xD;
      demonstrate efficacy the focus will be on estimating the intervention effect size, not making&#xD;
      a yes/no decision in a null hypothesis test based on an arbitrary α cutoff. Analyses will be&#xD;
      run using an intent-to-treat approach, with missing data addressed either by multiple&#xD;
      imputation or nonresponse weighting.&#xD;
