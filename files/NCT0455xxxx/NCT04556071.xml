  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Niraparib is an oral, potent and highly selective PARP1/2 inhibitor. It can be used as a&#xD;
      single drug in HRD positive ovarian cancer patients for multi-line therapy. Bevacizumab is a&#xD;
      recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits tumor angiogenesis and is also&#xD;
      recommended for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. Clinical studies showed that&#xD;
      niraparib combined with bevacizumab could significantly prolong progression free survival of&#xD;
      platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. We intend to conduct a single-arm, prospective,&#xD;
      open-label, phase II study to observe the efficacy and safety of niraparib combined with&#xD;
      bevacizumab in the treatment of FIGO III/IV platinum refractory/resistant ovarian cancer,&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. The results are expected to provide more&#xD;
      effective and precise treatment for platinum resistant recurrent/refractory ovarian cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      The study is a single-arm, prospective, open-label, phase II study to observe the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of niraparib combined with bevacizumab in the treatment of FIGO III/IV platinum&#xD;
      refractory/resistant ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer.The&#xD;
      primary end point is the objective response rate, and the secondary end points are&#xD;
      progression free survival, duration of remission, disease control rate and safety. We also&#xD;
      stratified analysis the level of tumor load, the status of BRCA and HRD on the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;
