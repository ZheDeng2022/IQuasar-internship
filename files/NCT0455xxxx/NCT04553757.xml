  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates how seizures can vary over time with changes in low grade gliomas and&#xD;
      its treatments. This study may help doctors find symptoms or triggers of seizures earlier&#xD;
      than normal, and ultimately earlier care or treatment for seizures.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the rate of change of seizure frequency and the status of the tumor at each&#xD;
      data collection point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain sufficient number of patients' data in order to power the analysis to determine&#xD;
      whether a change in seizure frequency correlates with tumor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate progression free survival and overall survival when compared with seizure&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a seizure assessment survey over 5 minutes at each clinic visit.&#xD;

    <description>Both average composite scores as well as individual question scores from the seizure survey will be evaluated. Will perform descriptive statistics to characterize the demographic and disease-related features of this population. Will perform regression analyses to the relationship of survey results to clinical and radiographic features. Cox regression analyses for other relevant post-hoc analyses may be performed.</description>

    <description>Radiographic information will be derived from brain MRIs performed on each patient at time of diagnosis, and subsequently at times of survey administration. Will perform descriptive statistics to characterize the demographic and disease-related features of this population. Will perform regression analyses to the relationship of survey results to clinical and radiographic features.

    <measure>Patient data collection</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will obtain sufficient number of patients' data in order to power the analysis to determine whether a change in seizure frequency correlates with tumor control. Clinical information to be extracted from the medical record includes but not limited to; date of birth, gender, date of diagnosis, clinical symptoms referable to the brain tumor, functional status and age at diagnosis, treatments applied, dates of progression, and date of death. Radiographic information will be derived from brain MRIs performed on each patient at time of diagnosis, and subsequently at times of survey administration. Will perform descriptive statistics to characterize the demographic and disease-related features of this population.</description>
