      Objective: To assess the efficacy of peri-operative alpha1 blockers on improving the success&#xD;
      rate and decreasing complications of non-stented ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy for ureteric&#xD;
      stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: A randomized control trial was conducted at two high volume urological&#xD;
      centers from September 2017 to December 2018. We enrolled 120 patients with lower ureteric&#xD;
      stones. They were randomly divided into two groups. Group A had 58 patients who underwent&#xD;
      non-stented ureteroscopy using Ho-YAG laser for stone disintegration and received&#xD;
      alpha1-blockers for one week preoperatively and another two weeks postoperatively, while&#xD;
      Group B had 62 patients who underwent non-stented ureteroscopy and laser and received&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
