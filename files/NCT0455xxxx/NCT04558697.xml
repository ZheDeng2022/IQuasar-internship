  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are more and more herbal preparations that are used for the purpose of treatment and&#xD;
      improvement of the clinical picture of vaginitis by patients themselves, but also by&#xD;
      healthcare professionals. Plant species, St. John's wort, chamomile, calendula, yarrow,&#xD;
      shepherd's purse and tea tree oil are well known for there anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial&#xD;
      and wound healing activity. This paper presents the results of a clinical study in which&#xD;
      three herbal formulations/vagitories, based on extracts of above mentioned plant species,&#xD;
      were investigated for their effectiveness on non-specific vaginitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was randomized controlled clinical study that included 210 women with diagnosed&#xD;
      non-specific vaginitis. Patients were divided into two basic groups, women in reproductive&#xD;
      stage and postmenopausal stage. Three subgroups, containing approximately 30 patients each,&#xD;
      received one of three vagitorie formulations for 5 days during which the effects on&#xD;
      subjective and objective symptoms were monitored.&#xD;
