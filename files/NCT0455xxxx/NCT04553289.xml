  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the randomized clinical trial is to investigate if &quot;exercising into pain&quot; gives&#xD;
      better results in term of clinical outcomes compared to a non-painful exercise program.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy is the first choice of treatment in the treatment of subacromial shoulder&#xD;
      pain (SSP). Guidelines suggest exercise therapy for at least three months and research&#xD;
      underlines the importance of progressive loaded exercise therapy at high dosage. However, it&#xD;
      is not clear which is the best type of exercise and if pain should be provoked or avoided&#xD;
      during exercise. Recent research found that painful exercises are beneficial in short term on&#xD;
      pain and function in patients with different kinds of chronic musculoskeletal pain. The aim&#xD;
      is to investigate if one painful exercise can give better and faster results in the&#xD;
      management of SSP than non-painful program.&#xD;

    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>There are 13 items, divided in two subscales: pain (5 items) and function (8 items). Each item is scored from 0 (no pain/no difficulty) to 10 (worst imaginable pain/so difficult it requires help) on a NPRS. The final score is a percentage derived from an average of the two subscales, where higher score means worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The participants will train during 12 with progressive loaded exercises, three times per week. There are 9 sessions of supervised physiotherapy treatment, lasting 30 minutes, while the rest of the sessions is conducted as home exercises. There are 4 strengthening exercises, including 2 in closed kinetic chain exercises and 2 executed with the elastic band or with dumbbell/weight. One exercise will be performed with pain ranging between 4 and 7 on a NPRS (Numeric Pain Rating Scale) and the rest of the exercises will be performed with no/slight pain, ranging between 0 and 2 on NPRS. At week 9, patients will continue to exercise with pain between 0 and 2 in all exercises. 10/15 minutes of manual therapy (posterior capsular release) will be applied during the physiotherapy session.</description>
