    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is a prospective, non-randomized, single- arm, multi-center early&#xD;
      feasibility study of the Aria CV Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) System implanted in patients&#xD;
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The purpose of this study is to validate that the&#xD;
      clinical use of the Aria CV PH System is safe for the patient, and to evaluate its&#xD;
      performance in treating patients with PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in a maximum of 10 centers in the United States with a planned&#xD;
      maximum enrollment of 45 patients to ensure up to 15 &quot;Device Deployed&quot; subjects. Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated at each of the following time intervals: preoperative, implant, 7-day (or&#xD;
      discharge if earlier) and 1-, 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-month post index procedure. The Aria CV PH&#xD;
      System will be assessed at each follow-up visit, as well as at 2- and 9- month and quarterly&#xD;
      between 12 and 24 months. The duration of the study is anticipated to be 2.5 years.&#xD;
