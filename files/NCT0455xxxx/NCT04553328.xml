  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of using TAB and ILIH nerve blocks&#xD;
      versus ILIH nerve block only for inguinal hernia repair in patients with liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining institutional ethical committee approval and written informed consent in&#xD;
      2019, 60 patients between the age of 40 and 70 year were divided randomly using a computer&#xD;
      generated randomization table and opaque sealed envelopes into two groups (30 patients in&#xD;
      each group) according to the type of block they received: Group (T) received ultrasound&#xD;
      guided (US) combined ipsilateral transverse abdominis plane (TAB) and ilioinguinal-&#xD;
      iliohypogastric (ILIH) nerve block. Group (I) received US guided ipsilateral illioinguinal-&#xD;
      illiohypogastric nerve block only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitoring was used throughout the surgery; heart rate (HR), non-invasive mean&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2)documented&#xD;
      at baseline before the block then at 5-min intervals intraoperative , then during the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period at 15 and 30 min, and at discharge from the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nasal prong was applied and supplemental oxygen at 3 l/min of fresh gas flow was given&#xD;
      throughout the procedure. It was explained clearly to the patients that any pain, discomfort,&#xD;
      or anxiety would be managed by the administration of local anesthetic (LA) infiltration with&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.25% during the operation or by conversion to general anesthesia (GA) if needed.&#xD;

    <description>The ILIH nerves were identified and located in the fascia compartment between the internal oblique and the transverse abdominis or external oblique muscles, a 20 G needle was advanced between the aponeurosis of the internal oblique and transverses abdominis muscles then 30 ml bupivacaine 0.25% was injected with intermittent aspiration,then 10 ml bupivacaine 0.25% was injected around the nerves.</description>
