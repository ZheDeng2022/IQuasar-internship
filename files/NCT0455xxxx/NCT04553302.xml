  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess hand functions and wrist joint position sense in&#xD;
      patients with and without PsA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 54 patients (18 of them RA, 18 of them PsA and, 18 of them asymptomatic&#xD;
      healthy group) were included. The patient group was selected from the patients who came to&#xD;
      the Izmir Katip Celebi University Ataturk Training and Research Hospital Rheumatology&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinic for routine control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were matched according to age and gender. It was recorded demographic and&#xD;
      clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grip and pinch strengths were evaluated within the scope of hand function evaluation. Wrist&#xD;
      joint position sense was evaluated along with hand functions.&#xD;
