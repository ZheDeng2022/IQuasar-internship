      People with brain injury commonly experience difficulties with memory, concentration,&#xD;
      attention and judgement, meaning that important everyday actions and tasks are not carried&#xD;
      out or not completed, limiting the ability to live independently. Technology-based solutions,&#xD;
      including smartphone applications, can help by providing prompts about intended actions at&#xD;
      the correct time. However, memory and attention impairments mean people forget to set&#xD;
      reminders or fail to set them accurately (e.g. setting the wrong time/date for events). Using&#xD;
      co-design methods with prospective users, the investigators developed ApplTree, a smartphone&#xD;
      reminding application with design features that can be personalised to individuals. ApplTree&#xD;
      prompts reminder setting, supports reminder entry to improve accuracy, and delivers users&#xD;
      with prompts at the appropriate times. A pilot randomised controlled trial will be conducted&#xD;
      to provide crucial information to inform a future larger scale efficacy trial of ApplTree as&#xD;
      an intervention to support memory in people with acquired brain injury.&#xD;

      Rationale Brain injury is a leading cause of disability in Scotland. The British Society of&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Medicine reports the prevalence of head injury in the UK to be 300 per 100,000&#xD;
      and the prevalence of disabled survivors of brain injury is 100-150 per 100,000. A&#xD;
      particularly high prevalence of disability following hospitalisation for brain injury has&#xD;
      been reported in Scotland (4.5 times higher than the Department of Health prevalence&#xD;
      estimate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with brain injury commonly experience difficulties with memory, concentration,&#xD;
      attention and judgement, meaning that important everyday actions and tasks are not carried&#xD;
      out or not completed, limiting the ability to live independently. Technology-based solutions,&#xD;
      including smartphone applications, can help by providing prompts about intended actions at&#xD;
      the correct time. However, memory and attention impairments mean people forget to set&#xD;
      reminders or fail to set them accurately (e.g. setting the wrong time/date for events). Using&#xD;
      co-design methods with prospective users, the investigators developed ApplTree, a smartphone&#xD;
      reminding application with design features that can be personalised to individuals. ApplTree&#xD;
      prompts reminder setting, supports reminder entry to improve accuracy, and delivers users&#xD;
      with prompts at the appropriate times. The investigators wish to find out if such an&#xD;
      intervention can improve the everyday memory performance of individuals with memory&#xD;
      difficulties following acquired brain injury compared to an off-the-shelf reminding app&#xD;
      (Google Calendar). During this project a pilot randomised controlled trial will be conducted&#xD;
      to provide crucial information to inform a future larger scale efficacy trial of ApplTree as&#xD;
      an intervention to support memory in people with acquired brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ApplTree app The investigators designed ApplTree with features that our research suggests can&#xD;
      help support independent use and increase the efficacy of prompting technology interventions,&#xD;
      and which can be personalised according to need and preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      User Interface (UI) Type: ApplTree has the option of a traditional 'broad-shallow' UI or a&#xD;
      'narrow-deep' UK. The 'narrow-deep' UI has several screens but little information on each&#xD;
      screen. Previous research has indicated that this is preferable for people with cognitive&#xD;
      impairments when searching for content online compared to the alternative, and more common,&#xD;
      'broad-shallow' UI that contains lots of information on each screen but a small number of&#xD;
      screens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unsolicited Prompts (UPs): ApplTree provides periodic prompts to encourage the user to set&#xD;
      reminders. This is helpful if people have self-monitoring, initiation or mood problems that&#xD;
      are common after neurological injury. The investigators investigated UP's previously using a&#xD;
      single case experimental design (n=3). Participants set more reminders when receiving UPs&#xD;
      illustrating their potential to increase reminder setting. More investigation is needed to&#xD;
      understand how they influence acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carer Support in App: Reminding software that allows input from carers can be effective as a&#xD;
      memory aid. ApplTree allows carer input so that carers can, when appropriate, set reminders&#xD;
      and send prompts to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific justification Technologies that send timely prompts to people about everyday&#xD;
      activities are an effective, low cost solution to support people with cognitive impairments&#xD;
      after brain injury. Our systematic review and meta-analysis found that prompting technology&#xD;
      improves memory performance for people with memory difficulties vs. practice as usual or a&#xD;
      paper diary/calendar (d = 1.27, large effect size, n=147). Reminding technology can also&#xD;
      reduce the burden on caregivers. This potential positive impact will only be seen in practice&#xD;
      if people have access to this technology (e.g. as part of their clinical rehabilitation). The&#xD;
      positive impact of reminding technology use will be greater if people are able to use the&#xD;
      technology independently when it is provided, and if the technology meets the individual&#xD;
      needs of the users. Our systematic review found few papers that investigated smartphone apps&#xD;
      (the state-of-the-art technology for delivering prompts) delivered through a clinical&#xD;
      service. Furthermore, only three studies asked participants to set reminders independently,&#xD;
      which is crucial to increasing functional independence. Our research with smartphone users&#xD;
      with ABI has highlighted that memory and attention difficulties prevent people from making&#xD;
      effective use of reminding apps. Due to cognitive impairments impacting usability, those who&#xD;
      could benefit most from reminding technology are the people for whom it is least accessible.&#xD;
      This may explain why uptake of reminding technology is currently low. There is, however,&#xD;
      insufficient evidence regarding the best user interface design for apps to ensure that people&#xD;
      with cognitive impairments are able to use them independently. It is also unknown whether it&#xD;
      is feasible and effective to introduce an app with these features to patients through&#xD;
      clinical services. Answering these questions is vital for this intervention to improve&#xD;
      independent functioning and alleviate caregiver burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will build on extensive previous work developing ApplTree - smartphone reminding&#xD;
      software with personalisable features, specifically designed for people with brain injury to&#xD;
      improve everyday functioning. Interventions that can be tailored to individuals' needs are&#xD;
      consistent with the drive towards personalised/ stratified medicine and treatment delivery.&#xD;
      The investigators will undertake a user study and a pilot randomised controlled trial that&#xD;
      will underpin a large-scale RCT to examine efficacy.&#xD;
