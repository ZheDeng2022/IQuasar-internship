    <textblock>
      Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer with&#xD;
      aggressive tumor behavior. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA) is an&#xD;
      effective curative treatment for early stage HCC. This thermal ablation of liver tumor&#xD;
      induces host immune response with changes in serum concentration of various cytokines. It is&#xD;
      not clear whether this host immune response correlates with tumor recurrence and long-term&#xD;
      patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This prospective study is to investigate the change of cytokines' level following&#xD;
      RFA or MWA for HCC and its clinical correlation with tumor recurrence and patients' long-term&#xD;
      survival data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Thermal ablation of HCC creates tumor antigen source for the generation of&#xD;
      antitumor immunity and enhances host immune responses. The resulting inflammation and changes&#xD;
      in cytokines may augment tumor cell death by increasing neutrophil infiltration and oxidative&#xD;
      burst mechanisms. On the other hand, there may be negative effects via the production of&#xD;
      growth factors, which could stimulate tumor cell growth within the sub-lethal margin.&#xD;
      Therefore, the ultimate clinical consequences would be significantly affected by these immune&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a prospective study on the measurement of changes of serum cytokines in&#xD;
      patients with HCC undergone RFA or MWA using the commercially available kit (MILLIPEX, Human&#xD;
      cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead panel - Immunology Multiplex Assay ), which measure 10&#xD;
      cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), TNF-α, CXCL8, CXCL9,&#xD;
      CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5. Statistical correlation will be performed between the cytokine change and&#xD;
      long-term patients' clinical outcome using the prospectively collected database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Patients with HCC undergone RFA or MWA in the Department of Surgery, The Chinese&#xD;
      University of Hong Kong will be recruited. Exclusion criteria were evidence of extrahepatic&#xD;
      metastasis, patients receiving combined hepatectomy and other local ablative therapy and&#xD;
      patients with decompensated liver function that preclude local ablative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: RFA or MWA will be performed for patients with HCC. The serum samples of all&#xD;
      consecutive recruited patients will be collected prospectively during the intervention. The&#xD;
      measurement of cytokines level will be performed in the Laboratory of Department of Chemical&#xD;
      Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong under the standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: Primary outcome measure is early intrahepatic tumor recurrence within&#xD;
      one year after thermal ablation. Secondary outcome measures are other tumor recurrence&#xD;
      pattern (late intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis), overall survival and&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: All data will be prospectively collected by a research assistant and&#xD;
      computerized in a database. Statistical analysis will be performed by Chi-square test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test, where appropriate, to compare discrete variables and Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
      to compare continuous variables. Cumulative survival will be computed by the Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      method and compared by Log-rank test. Multivariable analysis using logistic regression model&#xD;
      will be done to identify the independent prognostic factors affecting early tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: Understanding the relationship between the cytokines change during thermal&#xD;
      ablation and post-treatment tumor recurrence helps to identify high risk patients for the&#xD;
      possible adjuvant therapy in future study.&#xD;

      Background Liver cancer is the sixth most common malignancy in the world. It is the fourth&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer-related deaths and has a global incidence of more than 840,000 new&#xD;
      cases in 2018.1 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 75% - 85% of primary liver&#xD;
      cancer. Hepatectomy, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and orthotopic liver transplantation are&#xD;
      the main treatment options for patients with early stage HCC.2 Hepatectomy is only indicated&#xD;
      in patients with early stage HCC and preserved liver function, whereas the application of&#xD;
      liver transplantation is limited globally because of organ shortage. RFA is therefore the&#xD;
      most effective treatment in patients with HCC and borderline liver function due to cirrhotic&#xD;
      liver, especially in Asia-Pacific region where hepatitis B infection is prevalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal ablation kills tumors via direct thermal denaturation and coagulation of tumor&#xD;
      proteins.3 The retention of devitalized and damaged tumor cells within the body stimulates a&#xD;
      robust inflammatory response. It has also been reported that thermal ablation creates a tumor&#xD;
      antigen source for the generation of antitumor immunity and enhances host immune responses.4&#xD;
      Activated platelets release interleukin (IL) -1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and&#xD;
      transforming growth factor , which increase vascular permeability and promote chemotaxis.&#xD;
      Neutrophils are attracted to the ablation site and perform debris scavenging by releasing&#xD;
      free radicals via oxidative burst mechanisms aimed at destroying inciting agents. Macrophage&#xD;
      migration ensues, transitioning to the proliferative stage, during which macrophages secrete&#xD;
      growth factors, including TNF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast&#xD;
      growth factor.5 The level of proliferative activity of macrophages and lymphocytes is&#xD;
      mediated by IL-6 positively and IL-10 negatively.6, 7 In the event of an incomplete ablation&#xD;
      or nearly complete ablation, viable tumor cells in the sub-lethal ablation zone) may be&#xD;
      affected positively or negatively by the concomitant inflammatory response including&#xD;
      increased levels of cytokines and growth factors. Inflammation following ablation may have&#xD;
      negative effects via the production of growth factors and cytokines by macrophages and&#xD;
      lymphocytes, which could stimulate tumor cell growth within the sub-lethal zone.8 Human and&#xD;
      animal studies using immunohistochemical staining of tissues, enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
      assay of tissue lysates, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of plasma have shown&#xD;
      significant increase in specific inflammatory and immunomodulatory mediators after RFA.9, 10&#xD;
      The principle investigator has previously reported the inflammatory responses of RFA using&#xD;
      the porcine liver model that the level of systemic inflammatory markers (TNF and IL-1) was&#xD;
      significantly elevated after RFA, when compared with hepatectomy.11 Although pre-clinical&#xD;
      studies on inflammatory responses of thermal ablation for liver tumor are substantial,&#xD;
      clinical correlation of these micro-environmental reaction is limited in the literature.&#xD;
      Erinjeri et al.12 reported that the ablation type and primary diagnosis predicted the change&#xD;
      of IL-6 and patient age predicted the change of IL-10 after thermal ablation of tumors. IL-6&#xD;
      may act as surrogates for immunogenic cell death and the combination of immunogenic&#xD;
      death-inducing procedures with immune check-point inhibitor may be beneficial to prolong&#xD;
      patient survival after RFA.13 At the cellular level, RFA has proven to enhance&#xD;
      tumor-associated antigen-specific T cell response and this contributes to the HCC&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival of patients.14 Nonetheless, it is still not clear about the possible&#xD;
      relationship between RFA-induced cytokines change and its prognostic value on tumor&#xD;
      recurrence and long-term patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle investigator has reported the results of 209 patients receiving RFA as the sole&#xD;
      treatment for HCC.15 The overall tumor recurrence rate was up to 80% with median follow-up of&#xD;
      26 months. Hence, identification of high-risk patients who might develop early recurrence&#xD;
      using surrogate biomarkers (e.g. cytokines) carries an important clinical implication on the&#xD;
      use of adjuvant treatment (e.g. immune check-point inhibitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose this single-center prospective study to analysis the&#xD;
      change in serum cytokines level in patients with HCC treated by RFA or MWA. The result will&#xD;
      be used to correlate the clinical outcome of patients, especially tumor recurrence and&#xD;
      long-term survival outcome. This proposed clinical trial is of clinical importance in&#xD;
      establishing the potential role of immune response as surrogate biomarkers to predict&#xD;
      long-term patient outcome. It establishes the platform for future study of adjuvant treatment&#xD;
      using immune check-point inhibitor for patients with HCC treated by RFA or other thermal&#xD;
      ablative therapy. The investigators' center is a tertiary referral center in Hong Kong&#xD;
      managing patients with complicated hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. The number of new&#xD;
      cases of patients with HCC managed in the investigators' center is around 200 every year and&#xD;
      the number of patients with HCC undergoing hepatectomy is around 80 every year. All the&#xD;
      investigators are experts with vast experience in clinical and basic researches of patients&#xD;
      with HCC. The investigators have conducted and published several randomized trials on&#xD;
      management of HCC and other aspects of hepatobiliary surgery in international journals.16-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis RFA or MWA for HCC might induce inflammatory immune response with resulting change&#xD;
      in cytokines level. This micro-environmental reaction might positively or negatively regulate&#xD;
      the residual tumor cells, leading to the significant changes in tumor recurrence and&#xD;
      long-term patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study This prospective study aims to investigate the change of cytokines' level&#xD;
      following RFA or MWA for HCC and its clinical correlation with tumor recurrence and patients'&#xD;
      long-term survival data. Primary outcome measure is early tumor recurrence within one year&#xD;
      after RFA. Secondary outcome measures are other tumor recurrence pattern (late intrahepatic&#xD;
      recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis), overall survival and recurrence-free survival.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Application of kit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously analyze multiple cytokine and chemokine biomarkers with MILLIPLEX MAP Human&#xD;
      Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel - Immunology Multiplex Assay, in human serum, plasma&#xD;

&#xD;
      Expected time of study The investigators' institution is a major tertiary referral center for&#xD;
      HCC in Hong Kong. The patient recruitment will be started once the approval from Institution&#xD;
      Review Board is obtained. The recruitment period is around 12 months to 18 months. With the&#xD;
      median follow-up period of around 18 months, It is expected that the total period of study is&#xD;
      three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation Expected number of patients to be recruited is estimated at 60&#xD;
      according to the past patient number undergoing treatment under the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All data will be prospectively collected by a research assistant and&#xD;
      computerized in a database. Statistical analysis will be performed by Chi-square test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test, where appropriate, to compare discrete variables and Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
      to compare continuous variables. Cumulative survival will be computed by the Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      method and compared by Log-rank test. Multivariable analysis using logistic regression model&#xD;
      will be done to identify the independent prognostic factors affecting early tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration This study will be carried out in accordance with the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki of the World Medical Association and the International Conference on Harmonization -&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Written voluntary consent will be obtained after full explanation of the trial to the&#xD;
      patient before operation and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance to clinical applications&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study carries significant clinical influence on the surgical management of patient with&#xD;
      HCC. Since hepatitis B infection is still endemic in Asia-Pacific area like Hong Kong,&#xD;
      hepatitis B related HCC is still a burden among the whole pool of cancer patients. This study&#xD;
      aims to establish the potential role of immune response as surrogate biomarkers to predict&#xD;
      long-term patient outcome. It enhances the development of the platform for future study of&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment using immune check-point inhibitor for patients with HCC treated by&#xD;
      thermal ablative therapy.&#xD;
