  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concussions are the leading form of mild traumatic brain injury. Management of concussions&#xD;
      and mild traumatic brain injury is a high priority medical focus, social concern, and&#xD;
      research topic. Currently, there are no FDA approved treatments for acute concussion. The&#xD;
      current standard of care is rest followed by gradual return to normal activity. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to show improvement in the way patients feel or function after a concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OXE-103 is a protein hormone produced in the laboratory which identical to the hormone&#xD;
      ghrelin that is secreted by the stomach. This study will investigate the use of this hormone&#xD;
      as treatment for symptoms of acute concussion. The goal of this study is to show improvement&#xD;
      in the way study participants feel or function after concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OXE-103 is already FDA approved for other conditions, but not for concussion. For concussion,&#xD;
      it is considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine, if ghrelin is taken every day for two weeks, if the brain will heal&#xD;
      faster and help improve or resolve symptoms. The study will also include a placebo arm and a&#xD;
      non-treatment group (for those who wish to participate but do not want to receive any&#xD;
      treatment). The OXE-103 and placebo will be self-administered through injections using&#xD;
      needles.&#xD;

      All consenting participants will be screened for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two Parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Post-Acute (within 28 days of injury) Part B: Acute (within 24 hours of injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A does not include randomization and all enrolling subjects will be offered treatment&#xD;
      with OXE-103. Enrolling subjects in this Part A will also have the option to choose&#xD;
      participation in a non-treatment control group if they do not want treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B participation includes double-blinded randomization to receive either OXE-103 or&#xD;
      placebo. There is no option to choose participation in a non-treatment control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part B, consenting and eligible participants will either be randomized to receive study&#xD;
      drug (OXE-103) or placebo. The study team will also be blinded to the assigned treatment, so&#xD;
      they will not know which treatment participants have been assigned to take.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting participants must be willing to commit to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  give themselves subcutaneous injections twice a day (for the treatment groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  attend several study visits, which require both in-person and phone-only visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete various questionnaires and testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have blood drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have ECG's performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergo a pregnancy test (if of childbearing potential) and use contraception while on&#xD;
           study (for the treatment groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tell the study team about any side effects they might experience from the study drug&#xD;
           during study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total participation for the treatment groups will last about 7 weeks, which includes&#xD;
      screening, 14 days of taking the study drug, and 4 weeks of follow-up. Participation for the&#xD;
      non-treatment group will last the same amount of time.&#xD;

    <measure>Symptom Management - Post Concussion Symptom Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-44</time_frame>
    <description>The primary goal is to describe the change in number of symptoms and/or severity of symptoms in sub-acute concussion with treatment with OXE-103 using the Post Concussion Symptom Scale questionnaire during the intervention period at days 1 and 15 as well as during the post-treatment period at days 21 and 44.&#xD;
The Post Concussion Symptom Scale questionnaire consists of 23 common concussion symptoms which are assigned a ranking of severity on a scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). This tool is used to capture both severity of concussion symptoms as well as the number of symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life - QOLIBRI-OS</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-44</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary goal is to examine change in quality of life with treatment of sub-acute concussion using the Quality of Life after Brain Injury - Overall Scale questionnaire.&#xD;
The Quality of Life after Brain Injury - Overall Scale questionnaire consists of six questions which address satisfaction of life after injury. Responses are assigned a ranking on a scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life - PGAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-44</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary goal is to examine change in quality of life with treatment of sub-acute concussion using a Patient Global Assessment Scale, which is measured using a visual analogue scale. The range is from 0 (no impact) to 10 (greatest impact). This tool asks how concussion symptoms impact ability to function or perform daily activities.</description>

        INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In Part A (post-acute), subjects must be consented within 28 days post injury. In Part B&#xD;
        (acute), subjects must be consented, randomized, and start treatment within 24 hours of&#xD;
        presentation to the University of Kansas Health System Trauma Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects in both Part A and B will have a symptom severity score of at least 20 at the time&#xD;
        of randomization in order to reduce the expected degree (number and severity) of&#xD;
        spontaneous symptom resolution prior to study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with pre-existing neurologic conditions other than mTBI (including cognitive&#xD;
        dysfunction) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with concurrent long bone fractures or orbital fractures will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects receiving, or planning to receive, a continuous ketamine infusion while enrolled&#xD;
        in study will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with these known endocrinological abnormalities at baseline will be excluded from&#xD;
        study: diabetes mellitus, excess or deficiency of growth hormone, cortisol, or prolactin.&#xD;
        Exclusion from study for any other endocrinological abnormalities or diagnoses existing at&#xD;
        baseline are ultimately up to the discretion of the study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (&gt;2.5 mg/dL), or alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
        (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal, or bilirubin&#xD;
        (&gt;2.5 mg/dL) will exclude subjects from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any abnormal findings noted on imaging, such as hemorrhage, will be excluded&#xD;
        from the study. Subjects who meet criteria for moderate or severe TBI will also be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who are known to be pregnant will be excluded. Subjects who do not agree to&#xD;
        double-barrier contraception or abstinence (for female subjects of child-bearing potential&#xD;
        or male subjects who are sexually active with a female of child-bearing potential) until&#xD;
        the day following last dose (total of at least 5 half-lives) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In Part A subjects receiving other concomitant medications, physical therapy, or other&#xD;
        treatments related to their current mTBI will be eligible if they meet the inclusion&#xD;
        criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects (or household members) who are not able to inject themselves or the subject will&#xD;
        be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For both Part A and Part B, subjects are not allowed to be concurrently enrolled in another&#xD;
        therapeutic intervention clinical trial while participating in this study. Any subjects&#xD;
        currently enrolled in such a separate therapeutic intervention clinical trial, for any&#xD;
        condition, will be excluded from participating in this study. For clarification, this does&#xD;
        not include observational clinical trials or registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ultimately study subject participation will be at the discretion of the study physician.&#xD;
