  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a serotonergic (5-HT) hallucinogen widely used for&#xD;
      recreational and/or ethnomedical purposes. LSD is thought to induce its prototypical&#xD;
      psychedelic effects primarily via stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor. This study investigates&#xD;
      whether an LSD experience can be attenuated and shortened using 5-HT2A receptor antagonist&#xD;
      ketanserin administration after LSD once the psychedelic effects have established.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LSD is a so-called &quot;classic&quot; or serotonergic hallucinogen or psychedelic.The effects of LSD&#xD;
      have been frequently investigated in the past in both healthy participants and patients. In&#xD;
      these studies, LSD produced acute transient alterations in waking consciousness including&#xD;
      visual perceptual alterations, audio-visual synesthesia, derealization and depersonalization.&#xD;
      Moreover, several of these studies described robust and sustained effects of LSD in patients&#xD;
      suffering from addiction, anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its psychedelic effects are mainly attributed to its potent partial 5-HT2A receptor agonism.&#xD;
      Consistently, administration the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg) prior to the&#xD;
      administration of LSD (100 μg) almost completely prevented the acute effects of LSD in&#xD;
      another study of our research group (NCT03321136). The present study hypothesis is that&#xD;
      ketanserin (40 mg) administered 1h after LSD shortens and reduces the acute subjective&#xD;
      effects of LSD (100 μg) compared to LSD alone (100 μg) followed by placebo in healthy humans.&#xD;
      Such a finding would confirm a primarily competitive antagonism of ketanserin and LSD at the&#xD;
      5-HT2A receptor in vivo and indicate that LSD produces its psychedelic effects only when&#xD;
      present at the receptor.&#xD;
