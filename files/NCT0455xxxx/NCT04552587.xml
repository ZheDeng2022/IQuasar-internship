  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer survivors and their primary caregivers (N=25 dyads) will be enrolled to&#xD;
      pilot test a nutrition support system with a care planning clinic visit and a caregiver&#xD;
      mobile App. Participants will be asked to complete baseline and 6-week follow-up surveys. The&#xD;
      clinic session (offered in person or remotely) will include a needs assessment and a tailored&#xD;
      care plan with information, educational materials and referrals about participants' symptoms,&#xD;
      behaviors, social concerns and caregiving tasks. After the visit, the program will provide an&#xD;
      App for caregivers with follow-up resources and mobile support for one month.&#xD;

      The long-term goal of this research is to improve physical, emotional and social&#xD;
      post-treatment outcomes in head and neck cancer survivors and caregivers by implementing a&#xD;
      nutrition-focused mobile-Support program to prepare and support caregivers after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head and neck cancer survivors and their primary caregivers (N=25 dyads) will be recruited to&#xD;
      a single-arm intervention study to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and short-term&#xD;
      effects of a nutrition-focused mobile support system. The intervention includes 1) a clinic&#xD;
      visit (offered in-person or virtually) with a tablet-based needs assessment at the end of or&#xD;
      after completing treatment which will generate 2) a tailored care plan with messages,&#xD;
      educational materials and referrals mapped to survivor and caregiver-endorsed concerns and 3)&#xD;
      a caregiver App with encouragement, reminders and tips delivered through messaging and peer&#xD;
      videos. Participants will complete baseline and 6-week follow-up surveys.&#xD;
