  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate copeptin values after the subcutaneous injection of glucagon in&#xD;
      adults (healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia). It is&#xD;
      to investigate whether glucagon stimulates the release of copeptin as a surrogate of&#xD;
      vasopressin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The differentiation between central diabetes insipidus (cDI) and primary polydipsia (PP) is&#xD;
      cumbersome. To date the test with the highest diagnostic accuracy is copeptin measurement&#xD;
      after hypertonic saline Infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instead of hypertonic saline Infusion, arginine infusion - known to stimulate growth hormone&#xD;
      - is a potent stimulator of the neurohypophysis and provides a new diagnostic tool in the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of cDI. Copeptin measurements upon arginine stimulation discriminated&#xD;
      patients with diabetes insipidus vs. patients with primary polydipsia with a high diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of 94%. Glucagon has been shown to stimulate GH-secretion. In analogy to the known&#xD;
      stimulatory effect of arginine Infusion it is hypothesized that glucagon might stimulate the&#xD;
      posterior pituitary gland and could therefore be a novel diagnostic test in the&#xD;
      polyuria-polydipsia syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to evaluate copeptin values after the subcutaneous injection of glucagon in&#xD;
      adults (healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned as a double-blind randomized-controlled cross-over trial consisting of&#xD;
      two parts, including healthy adults (study part 1 - proof of concept) and adults with known&#xD;
      diagnosis of cDI or PP (study part 2 - pilot study). Study parts 1 and 2 will be conducted&#xD;
      consecutively. If the results of study part 1 suggest that glucagon is a potent stimulator of&#xD;
      Copeptin in healthy adults, study part 2 will be conducted. Participants will receive&#xD;
      glucagon injection and placebo injection in random order.&#xD;

Study parts 1 and 2 will be conducted consecutively. If the results of study part 1 suggest that glucagon is a potent stimulator of Copeptin in healthy adults, study part 2 will be conducted.&#xD;
The half of the study group will start with test day A (injection of glucagon), followed by test day B (injection of placebo) and the other half will start with test day B (injection of placebo), followed by test day A (injection of glucagon).

    <description>Glucagon with the empirical formula of C153H225N43O49S, and a molecular weight of 3483 g/mol, is a single-chain polypeptide containing 29 amino acid residues. Glucagon is provided in a single dose vial as powder. One container contains 1 mg of glucagon which results in a concentration of 1 mg/ml after dissolution in a volume of 1 ml (Glucagen NovoNordisk (Hypokit)). The currently used standard dose regimen is 1 mg of glucagon in adults. The solution for subcutaneous injection will be prepared by the study personnel according to the attached package leaflet.</description>
