      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of M72/AS01E vaccination&#xD;
      in virally suppressed, antiretroviral-treated participants with human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      infection (HIV).&#xD;

      As of 18 December 2020, participant randomization is on hold due pending investigational&#xD;
      product supply at the trial sites and not due to safety concerns. Sites will continue to&#xD;
      recruit during this period to proactively plan for randomization upon investigational product&#xD;
      availability.&#xD;
