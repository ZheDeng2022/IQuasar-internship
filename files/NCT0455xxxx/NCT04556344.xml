  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional skills are the ability to use emotions cleverly in daily life. Good emotional&#xD;
      skills are associated with better mental and physical health in healthy and clinical&#xD;
      populations. However, to our knowledge, cancer patients have never benefited from an&#xD;
      intervention aiming at increasing their emotional skills. Our goal was thus to design and&#xD;
      test such an intervention. A prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      will be conducted in esogastric and lung cancer patients after antineoplastic treatments.&#xD;
      Forty-three patients are expected in each arm. The primary outcome is the change in emotional&#xD;
      skills assessed using a patient-reported validated questionnaire between the start and two&#xD;
      weeks after the end of the intervention and at 2-month follow-up. The experimental arm will&#xD;
      have to follow three individual sessions on emotional skills (i.e. identification,&#xD;
      understanding, expression and regulation of emotions) while the control arm will have to&#xD;
      follow three sessions of relaxation. In each arm, the first session can be held face to face&#xD;
      or over the phone and the last two sessions will be held over the phone. Patients have&#xD;
      exercises to practice in between sessions.It is hypothesised that the experimental group will&#xD;
      experience a greater increase in emotional skills than the control group.&#xD;
