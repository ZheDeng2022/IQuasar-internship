      A phase I, a single-center, non-randomized, open, single-dose administration study to explore&#xD;
      the safety, pharmacokinetics of Yimitasvir phosphate capsules in subjects with moderate and&#xD;
      severe liver function impairment and healthy subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into four cohorts, cohort A and cohort C in healthy subjects, cohort B&#xD;
      for moderate liver function impairment participants, cohort D for severe liver function&#xD;
      impairment, participants in cohort A and cohort B, group C and group D should be matched in&#xD;
      terms of sex, age, and body mass index (BMI). A total of 32 subjects, 8 in each cohort, both&#xD;
      male and female, are planned to be enrolled. If a complete PK blood sample is not collected&#xD;
      due to subjects' early withdrawal from the study, new subjects will be enrolled to meet the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters that can be evaluated for each cohort of 8 subjects.&#xD;
