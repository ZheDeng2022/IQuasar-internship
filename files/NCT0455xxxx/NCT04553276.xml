  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A &quot;Clinical Registry&quot; is a database which contains clinical information about people with&#xD;
      different medical conditions. They are used in many countries throughout the world to help&#xD;
      medical teams to better understand specific diseases and improve the care and treatment of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UK Severe Asthma Registry has been collecting data on patients attending Severe Asthma&#xD;
      Clinics in the UK since 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining appropriate consent from patients to use their information, data is entered&#xD;
      by the patient's own clinical team and it is kept up-to-date to follow clinical progress and&#xD;
      response to treatments. Very strict controls are in place to make sure individuals cannot be&#xD;
      identified from the Registry and all information available from the National Registry is&#xD;
      anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the local clinic team, occasionally trusted third parties will also be able to&#xD;
      identify you, if required to do so, on a strict need-to-know basis. This is necessary to&#xD;
      ensure that the Registry works efficiently, or as a part of a Research Project, previously&#xD;
      approved by a Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the Registry has a number of uses including judging which severe asthma treatments&#xD;
      are of greater benefit, to identify different subgroups of severe asthma and trial new&#xD;
      therapies and to provide information for planning future services for people with severe&#xD;
      asthma. The use of any information from the UK Severe Asthma Registry requires approval of&#xD;
      the Steering Committee which is made up of the refractory asthma specialists from across the&#xD;
      UK and who will have access to data protection, legal and ethics expertise where necessary,&#xD;
      to safeguard the use of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the Registry closes, data will be returned to the local clinic team if requested,&#xD;
      otherwise it will be destroyed. Participation is entirely voluntary and patients can withdraw&#xD;
      consent form the Registry at any time by informing their local clinical team. The Data&#xD;
      Controller from the UK Severe Asthma Registry is Queen's University Belfast and the Data&#xD;
      Processor is Dendrite Clinical Services Ltd which is a commercial provider of database and&#xD;
      registry systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently 14 Networks of UK dedicated Specialist Difficult Asthma Services&#xD;
      submitting data to the UK Registry: Belfast City Hospital; Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield,&#xD;
      London; Birmingham Regional Severe Asthma Service; South Thames &amp; Kent Severe Asthma Service;&#xD;
      East Midlands Severe Asthma Network; North West Midlands Severe Asthma Service; Yorkshire&#xD;
      Asthma MDT; East of England Severe Asthma Network; Wessex Severe Asthma Network; South West&#xD;
      Asthma Network; North West Asthma Network, Newcastle Severe Asthma Network and Greater&#xD;
      Glasgow &amp; Clyde.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry was set up to standardise clinical services in the UK and facilitate research&#xD;
      into patients with difficult asthma. Patients that attend difficult asthma services across&#xD;
      the UK are approached to give consent for inclusion. The Registry is hosted online by&#xD;
      Dendrite Clinical Systems and admits password protected anonymised data, after fully informed&#xD;
      written consent is obtained from patients (see Patient Information and Consent sheets). The&#xD;
      individual centre data can be downloaded locally by registered users for audit purposes. The&#xD;
      Registry records patient demographics including gender, age at diagnosis, race, occupation,&#xD;
      smoking status, BMI. Disease characteristics such as asthma medication, unscheduled&#xD;
      healthcare visits, exacerbations, hospital and ICU admissions, blood and sputum&#xD;
      investigations, allergen testing, pulmonary function are also recorded in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects have been entered into the Registry in a non-selected manner and there are currently&#xD;
      over 4800 subjects in the Registry with detailed demographic, disease characteristics and&#xD;
      health outcome data. Of these subjects, the majority after detailed assessment fulfil the&#xD;
      American Thoracic Society definition of refractory asthma, whilst others after detailed&#xD;
      assessment are identified as having non-refractory asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry has also been expanded to collect data on bronchial thermoplasty in line with&#xD;
      NICE Guidance on bronchial thermoplasty for severe asthma&#xD;
      (http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg419).&#xD;
&#xD;
      the Registry with detailed demographic, disease characteristics and health outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of NHS England Central Commissioning for Specialist Severe Asthma Services, all&#xD;
      specialist centres in the UK will be required to input data into the Registry to enable&#xD;
      benchmarking between centres.&#xD;
