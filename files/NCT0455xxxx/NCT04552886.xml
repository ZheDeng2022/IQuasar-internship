  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective treatments are desperately needed for glioblastoma (GBM) patients. This phase I&#xD;
      clinical trial assesses the safety of a novel personalized dendritic-cell vaccine&#xD;
      administered to GBM patients shortly after completing standard-of-care treatments. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will evaluate patient progression-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm (non-randomized) first-in-man pilot study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of delivering a dendritic cell vaccine in nine to twenty-four (n=9-24) adult&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) after undergoing neurosurgical tumor resection,&#xD;
      and in whom a neuropathological diagnosis has been established. Standard of care chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiation therapy shall be followed as per routine neuro-oncologic paradigms after which&#xD;
      patients enrolled into this study will receive a personalized vaccine beyond standard of&#xD;
      care. Effective adjuvant therapies are urgently needed for these patients given that standard&#xD;
      of care is rarely successful in preventing recurrence among GBM patients, nor death among&#xD;
      relapsed patients with this very poor-prognosis tumor type. The study is constructed in a 3+3&#xD;
      algorithm for three steps of dose escalation with rigorous and mandatory safety monitoring.&#xD;
