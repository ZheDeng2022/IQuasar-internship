      The purpose of this research is to find out if hormone therapy in transgender subjects'&#xD;
      changes hormone receptors in blood, muscle and fat; fat production; muscle production; and&#xD;
      inflammation processes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Throughout recorded history, some men and women have experienced emotional distress at being&#xD;
      physically &quot;trapped&quot; in wrong gender. Gender incongruence refers to the state where one's&#xD;
      internal sense of gender differs from the gender assigned at birth. Advances in psychology&#xD;
      and in our understanding of human sexuality have permitted the recognition of gender&#xD;
      incongruence (also called transgender) as a biological phenomenon. The acceptance by the&#xD;
      society has led to an expansion of health care services available to these individuals for&#xD;
      supportive treatment. Gender affirming hormone therapy, usually provided by endocrinologists,&#xD;
      is pivotal for the transition of these individuals into their desired gender. This therapy&#xD;
      typically consists of testosterone or estrogen (male and female sex hormones) to transition&#xD;
      into transmen or transwomen, respectively. The hormone treatment results in a &quot;second&#xD;
      puberty&quot;, wherein biological men receiving estrogen gain fat around hips and thighs, lose&#xD;
      muscle and develop breasts. Biological women receiving testosterone lose fat, gain muscle,&#xD;
      stop having menses and develop a deeper voice. However, our knowledge of the mechanisms of&#xD;
      these hormones at the tissue level in transgender population is lacking. In this study, we&#xD;
      plan to evaluate&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. hormone receptors that carry out the action of sex hormones in fat tissue and&#xD;
           mononuclear cells (a type of immune cell in blood) following gender affirming therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the mechanism that lead to growth or suppression of fat mass or lean mass&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. effect on inflammation (a cardiovascular risk marker) The hormone treatment of gender&#xD;
           incongruence is a relatively untested therapy. The treatment is based on extrapolations&#xD;
           and assumptions from hormone treatment in hypogonadal (hormone deficient) in cis-gender&#xD;
           (same gender, no incongruence) individuals. We expect that our mechanistic studies will&#xD;
           initiate an understanding into the actions of transgender therapy at the cellular level.&#xD;
