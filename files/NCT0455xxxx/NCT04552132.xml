  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with painful molars will be randomly assigned to 2 different groups: GentleWave and&#xD;
      EndoActivator. The root canals will be completed using identical protocols except in the mode&#xD;
      of delivery and activation of irrigation (using either the GentleWave or EndoActivator).&#xD;
      Postoperative pain and pain pill consumption will be measured for the 4 days following their&#xD;
      root canal using a Visual Analog Scale and Pain Pill Log, respectively. The alternative&#xD;
      hypothesis is that patients undergoing treatment using the GentleWave will experience less&#xD;
      pain postoperatively and will consume fewer pain pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 12-month follow up with exam and radiographs will be completed to evaluate healing.&#xD;
