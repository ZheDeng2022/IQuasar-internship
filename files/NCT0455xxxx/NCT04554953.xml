  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination drug&#xD;
      containing fimasartan and statins on the control of hypertension and dyslipidemia, and the&#xD;
      secondary objective is to evaluate the drug cost reduction effect, patients' satisfaction&#xD;
      level and safety of the combination drug administration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a non-interventional, multicenter, prospective observational study&#xD;
      for patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. If a patient voluntarily provides written&#xD;
      consent to provide information for this study, the enrollment number will be assigned to&#xD;
      subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and follow-up will be conducted for&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks. Pre-specified study-related data will be collected in the case report&#xD;
      form during the observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study, and the number or interval of subjects' visits to the&#xD;
      hospital is determined by the investigators' clinical judgment under actual medical&#xD;
      circumstances in principle. Whether to participate in this study will not affect the&#xD;
      patients' treatment (physician's prescription or diagnostic, therapeutic decisions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up time points specified below indicate the time points of data collection. That&#xD;
      is, the schedule of subjects' visits is freely determined by the investigators based on the&#xD;
      medical condition of the subjects regardless of the follow-up time points specified in this&#xD;
      protocol, but data that are generated during the study period and are deemed necessary in&#xD;
      relation to the study may be collected in the case report form.&#xD;
