  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled, single-blinded clinical study which conducted over&#xD;
      six months (May to October 2016) in different Jordanian cities, where most of Syrian refugees&#xD;
      reside. The primary aim of this study was to assess refugees' adherence and knowledge of&#xD;
      their chronic medications, and impact of the medication management review (MMR) service&#xD;
      delivered by a clinical pharmacist on their adherence and knowledge of their chronic&#xD;
      medications three months following delivering the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed consent form was signed by all participants who accepted to participate (n=106).&#xD;
      Participants were then randomized into intervention and control groups. The first group would&#xD;
      have received the medication management review service during the study period, while the to&#xD;
      the other group directly after the study was completed (after three months' time). Two&#xD;
      validated questionnaire were used in the study for assessment; adherence to medications&#xD;
      questionnaire and Knowledge about chronic medications questionnaire. These questionnaire were&#xD;
      filled by tha patients at baseline and follow up home visits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized interventional clinical study, conducted over six months (May to&#xD;
      October 2016) in different Jordanian cities, where most of Syrian refugees reside. Clinics&#xD;
      which are specialized for Syrian refugees were approached by the clinical pharmacist&#xD;
      (researcher) in order to meet Syrian refugees, recruit eligible participants and arrange for&#xD;
      their first home visits. An informed consent form was signed by all participants who accepted&#xD;
      to participate. Participants were then randomized into intervention and control groups using&#xD;
      a predetermined list obtained by the computer randomization program (www.randomizer.org). The&#xD;
      study was single - blinded, hence, participants were not informed of the group they were&#xD;
      randomized into, but they were informed that they would have been in either of two study&#xD;
      groups. The first group would have received the medication management review (MMR) service&#xD;
      during the study period, while the to the other group directly after the study was completed&#xD;
      (after three months' time). Appointments were arranged at the physicians' clinics for all&#xD;
      participants to be visited by the clinical pharmacist at their homes. At the baseline home&#xD;
      visit, the clinical pharmacist documented participants' demographics, acute and chronic&#xD;
      medical problems, history of present diseases, past medical history, lifestyle, family&#xD;
      history, allergies, vital signs, physical examination information, diagnostic test data, lab&#xD;
      results, current medications and issues related to the short and long term management of the&#xD;
      patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MMR service was completed following verification of collected baseline data. The home&#xD;
      visits were planned not to exceed one hour. During these visits, self-completed&#xD;
      questionnaires were completed by the participants, evaluating their adherence and knowledge&#xD;
      about their chronic medications. The clinical pharmacist identified and documented the&#xD;
      treatment-related problems (TRPs) for each patient in both groups at baseline. The physician&#xD;
      was identified based on the participant's reported clinic and on participant's choice when&#xD;
      more than one physician was visited by the participant. Following receipt of the letter,&#xD;
      physicians addressed the recommendations and returned the letter to the pharmacist showing&#xD;
      approved and rejected recommendations. Participants were called by the pharmacist to visit&#xD;
      the physician and have the approved recommendations applied. Counselling and education were&#xD;
      delivered to participants in the intervention group regarding their illnesses, knowledge of&#xD;
      medications and adherence to their treatment. Three months post baseline, new appointments&#xD;
      were arranged through a phone call by the clinical pharmacist, and all participants were&#xD;
      revisited at home. Data needed to assess TRPs where recollected (as was done at baseline),&#xD;
      plus the adherence and knowledge about chronic medications' questionnaires was completed for&#xD;
      all participants. At the end of the study, control group participants received the MMR and&#xD;
      pharmacist counselling service exactly as was delivered to the intervention group&#xD;
      participants at baseline. For the purpose of data documentation and evaluation, the adherence&#xD;
      to medication questionnaire and the knowledge about chronic medications were used. Data were&#xD;
      coded then entered into the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20.&#xD;
      Continuous variables were expressed as mean Â± standard deviation . Differences within the&#xD;
      same group were detected using paired sample t-test for continuous variables. Group&#xD;
      differences (between the intervention and control groups) were detected using the independent&#xD;
      sample t-test or Mann Whitney U-test (based on the normality of data following testing) for&#xD;
      continuous variables. Categorical data were expressed as proportion (%) and analysed using&#xD;
      Chi-square test. A probability value of &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant&#xD;
      for all analysis's tests.&#xD;

    <description>how often the patient during the last month forgot to take his/her medication/s, skipped it, stopped it when feeling better, stopped it when feeling worse or stopped it when they experienced a side effect. The measurement scale used in this questionnaire was scored at 0 (never), 1 (rarely), 2 (sometimes), 3 (often) and 4 (always). Hence, adherence was analysed as a continuous scale out of 32. Higher scores indicted lower adherence by the patient.</description>

    <measure>Knowledge about chronic medications scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consisted of five questions related to patients' medications including 1- scientific medication name, 2- generic medication name, 3- how, 4- when, and 5- why was the patient taking each medication. The knowledge about medications was analysed as a continuous scale out of five. Higher scores indicated less knowledge about one's medication therapy.</description>
