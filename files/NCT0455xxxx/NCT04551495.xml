  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite different clinical characteristics including the response to treatment and the&#xD;
      patterns of metastatic relapse, invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILBC) is treated like&#xD;
      invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDBC) carcinoma both in the clinics and in clinical trials.&#xD;
      A large majority of ILBC are ER+/HER2- and almost 90% have loss of E-cadherin (CDH1)&#xD;
      expression. A non-clinical study of CDH1 synthetic lethality interactions has identified ROS1&#xD;
      as a potential target. In vivo, ROS1 inhibitors produced profound antitumor effects in&#xD;
      multiple models of E-cadherin-defective breast cancer, providing the preclinical rationale&#xD;
      for assessing ROS1 inhibitors in this setting. Endocrine therapy being the mainstay of&#xD;
      therapy for ER+/HER2- ILBC and the pre-operative setting offering a platform for rapid drug&#xD;
      evaluation and biomarker research, the ROSALINE phase 2 study will evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      Entrectinib (a potent inhibitor of ROS1 among other targets) in combination with letrozole (+&#xD;
      goserelin in premenopausal women) in the early setting of ILBC (stages 1 to 3). The&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy will last 4 months and post-operative therapy will follow local practice.&#xD;
      Biomarker research will include RNA sequencing of initial biopsis and surgical specimens, as&#xD;
      well as liquid biopsies.&#xD;

      The neoadjuvant setting has been the target of increasing interest recently, as it offers the&#xD;
      possibility of direct evaluation of treatment effect on tumour size, better surgical results&#xD;
      as well as for the possible research opportunities it provides via the comparative analysis&#xD;
      of tumour biology and clinical outcomes before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILBC) is the second most common histologic subtype (5-15%)&#xD;
      after invasive ductal breast cancer (IDBC). Despite clinical and pathologic differences, ILBC&#xD;
      is still treated as IDBC. Indeed, subjects with ILBC tend to have lower response rates to&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapeutic agents and some results have suggested that they might derive&#xD;
      increased benefit with aromatase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy are FDA-approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer following the results of 7 positive phase&#xD;
      3 trials. These agents are currently tested in phase 3 studies in the adjuvant setting and&#xD;
      might achieve the status of standard of care for subjects with ER-positive/HER2-negative&#xD;
      early breast cancer treated with curative intent. In the NeoPAL (UCBG10/4, NCT02400567)&#xD;
      neoadjuvant randomized study, Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) 0-1 status was achieved for 7.7%&#xD;
      of subjects in the letrozole + palbociclib arm. This rate is not available for the 7 subjects&#xD;
      with lobular breast cancer enrolled in this arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In lobular breast cancer, loss of E-cadherin (CDH1) expression is the most frequent oncogenic&#xD;
      event and is present in 90% of cases. In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems as well as&#xD;
      different functional profiling modalities (genetic and chemical screens) have been used to&#xD;
      identify CDH1 synthetic lethality interactions. In vivo, ROS1 inhibitors produced profound&#xD;
      antitumor effects in multiple models of E-cadherin-defective breast cancer, providing the&#xD;
      preclinical rationale for assessing ROS1 inhibitors in this setting. A study is currently&#xD;
      investigating this hypothesis in ER+/HER2- metastatic lobular breast cancer (NCT03620643).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entrectinib is a potent small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets oncogenic&#xD;
      rearrangements in NTRK, ROS1, and ALK. In vitro, entrectinib potently ROS1 at low nanomolar&#xD;
      concentrations, with an average median inhibitory concentration of 0.007 μM against ROS1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single arm, multi-center, phase 2 trial will include pre and post-menopausal women with&#xD;
      ER-positive/HER2-negative early stage invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of combining endocrine therapy with entrectinib. Subjects will receive four 28-day&#xD;
      cycles of letrozole 2.5 mg daily in combination with entrectinib 600 mg daily. Pre-menopausal&#xD;
      women will receive goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' response to therapy will be evaluated at screening, after 2 cycles and after the 4&#xD;
      cycles of treatment by breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An ECG will be performed at&#xD;
      screening and then before cycle 2. Surgery will take place after at least 16 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment, during week 18 (+ 7-day window). Breast and axillary surgery will follow local&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative therapy will be at the discretion of the investigator and will follow local&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
