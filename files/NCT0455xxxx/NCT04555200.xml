  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When oral rehydration is impossible, enteral rehydration via the nasogastric route has been&#xD;
      the recommended method of rehydration since 2008 by ESPGHAN ( European Society for Paediatric&#xD;
      Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition ), for children with acute gastroenteritis.&#xD;
      However, these recommendations are rarely followed in France. These recommendations were not&#xD;
      applied in the Children's Emergency Department of BREST University Hospital. The&#xD;
      investigators changed the protocol and shared it with the caregivers of the emergency unit.&#xD;
      The investigators studied the impact of this change of protocol&#xD;

      The main purpose was to assess the proportion of children rehydrated by nasogastric tube(NG)&#xD;
      after protocol change. Secondary outcomes were to assess hospital length of stay and sides&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a retro and prospective study. The first phase took place from June to September 2018&#xD;
      and the second from June to September 2019. Any child presenting to pediatric emergencies for&#xD;
      acute gastroenteritis requiring nonoral rehydration was included.&#xD;
