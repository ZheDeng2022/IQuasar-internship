  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a variety of disorders that result from the&#xD;
      continuous activation of the immunoinflammatory cascade, whose etiology has not been defined&#xD;
      in some cases. Classical IBD include Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and&#xD;
      indeterminate colitis. These diseases are chronic and are characterized by alternating&#xD;
      periods of recurrence and remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Society of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) defined malnutrition as a&#xD;
      state resulting from lack of uptake or intake of nutrition leading to altered body&#xD;
      composition (decreased fat-free mass and body cell mass), resulting in diminished physical&#xD;
      and mental function and impaired clinical outcome from disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of Malnutrition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is very&#xD;
      high. it presents in up to 70% of patients with active disease and up to 38% in patients with&#xD;
      remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors contribute to the malnutrition in IBD including insufficient nutrient intake&#xD;
      as a consequence of impaired appetite (anorexia, stomachache), short bowel syndrome, impaired&#xD;
      nutrient absorption (diarrhea, villus atrophy, bowel resection, intestinal flora overgrowth),&#xD;
      increased nutrient losses (bleeding, fistulae), and food-drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition in IBD has been associated with several adverse clinical outcomes. IBD patients&#xD;
      with nutritional deficiencies may present with higher mortality rate, length of stay in the&#xD;
      hospital, infectious rate, and even thromboembolic events than those without nutritional&#xD;
      deficiencies. Furthermore, undernutrition in patients with postoperative conditions has been&#xD;
      associated with increased complications such as anastomotic leakage and breakdown, infection&#xD;
      including sepsis and pneumonia, prolonged hospitalization, and increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBD is clearly associated with intestinal dysbiosis. Changes in the microbiome have a pivotal&#xD;
      role in determining the onset of the pathology, when the genetic background of the individual&#xD;
      makes him/her predisposed and other concomitant environmental factors intervene. Results of&#xD;
      studies aimed at characterizing the microbiota of patients suffering from IBD, even sometimes&#xD;
      with checkered results, indicate a generalized decrease in biodiversity, measured by an&#xD;
      appropriate parameter-alpha-as well as a reduction in specific taxa including Firmicutes and&#xD;
      Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus and Eubacterium. IBD patients also present a reduction in&#xD;
      species producing butyrate, a short chain fatty acid positively modulating intestinal&#xD;
      homeostasis and reducing inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding environmental factors, accumulating data have proven that various nutritional&#xD;
      components in diet can play a significant role in the development and clinical course of IBD.&#xD;
      Dietary nutrients alter the composition of the gut microbiota and intestinal permeability,&#xD;
      influencing the interaction between the host and gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is a nutritional model inspired by the traditional dietary&#xD;
      pattern of some of the countries of the Mediterranean basin. Mediterranean dietary pattern&#xD;
      (MDP) gather the following characteristics: abundant consumption of olive oil and high&#xD;
      consumption of fruits, vegetables, cereals (preferably as whole grain), legumes, nuts and&#xD;
      seeds. The MDP also includes moderate consumption of fish and shellfish, white meat, eggs,&#xD;
      and fermented dairy products (cheese and yogurt), as well as relatively small amounts of red&#xD;
      meat, processed meats, and foods rich in sugars. Frequent but moderate intake of wine,&#xD;
      especially red wine with meals is also recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from clinical and translational research on the Mediterranean diet point to its&#xD;
      possible meaningful use in managing IBD, and thus additional studies could have the potential&#xD;
      to add further insights to the field. Concerning published data, it was observed that 153&#xD;
      Italian healthy subjects were investigated for their dietary habits and their gut microbiota&#xD;
      was assessed, and high-level adherence to a Mediterranean diet was found to beneficially&#xD;
      impact the gut microbiota and associated metabolome. These studies provided the first&#xD;
      concrete evidence for the interconnection between Mediterranean dietary patterns, gut&#xD;
      microbiota and microbial metabolites as they observed that the consumption of fruit,&#xD;
      vegetables and legumes by subjects with satisfactory adherence to the Mediterranean diet was&#xD;
      associated with an increase in fecal SCFA levels, an effect that was likely boosted by&#xD;
      bacteria belonging to both the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes capable of degrading&#xD;
      carbohydrates not digestible by the host. When eight adult patients suffering from CD&#xD;
      followed the Mediterranean diet for 6 weeks, their transcriptome analysis showed a change in&#xD;
      expression of more than 3000 genes; changes in the intestinal microbiota, although not&#xD;
      significant, showed a trend towards normalization with an increase in the expression of&#xD;
      Bacteroidetes (17.89% to 18.74%), Clostridium cluster IV (19.2% to 21.86%) and Clostridium&#xD;
      cluster XIVa (26.78% to 28.79%) and a decrease in the abundance of Proteobacteria (5.93% to&#xD;
      5.48%) and Bacillaceae (4.65% to 4.21%).&#xD;
