  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of TAK-994 and to&#xD;
      determine the effect of TAK-994 (compared to placebo) on sleepiness, as measured by mean&#xD;
      sleep latency on the maintenance of wakefulness Test (MWT), in an acute sleep phase delay&#xD;
      paradigm in healthy participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-994. The study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety/tolerability, PD, and PK of TAK-994 in an acute sleep phase delay paradigm in healthy&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to approximately 18 healthy participants. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment sequences which will remain undisclosed to the&#xD;
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-994 Dose A + Placebo + TAK-994 Dose B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-994 Dose B + TAK-994 Dose A + Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo + TAK-994 Dose B + TAK-994 Dose A&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 10 weeks. Participants will be followed up&#xD;
      remotely on Day 7 after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Sleep Latency Over Four Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) Sessions After Initial Dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 hours after initial dosing in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>MWT is a validated objective measure that evaluates a person's ability to remain awake under soporific conditions for a defined period of time. Tendency to fall asleep is measured via electroencephalography-derived sleep latency. Mean sleep latency: mean time to sleep onset, over 4 MWT sessions (at approximately 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after initial dosing).</description>

             assessment of sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At the time of screening, be receiving treatment with nasal/oronasal positive airway&#xD;
             pressure for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have abnormal findings on the initial polysomnography conducted on Day -1 (check-in)&#xD;
             of the first treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have traveled across 2 or more time zones within the 2 weeks before screening.&#xD;
