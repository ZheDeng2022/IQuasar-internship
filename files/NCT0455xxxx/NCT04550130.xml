  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, randomised, multi-centre, dose evaluation study of the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      TLA Gut™ leukapheresis treatment in patients with UC. The aim of this trial is to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of two different TLA Gut™ dose regimens in patients with acute&#xD;
      exacerbation of UC. Enrolled patients will participate in a 6-week treatment phase and a 20-&#xD;
      week follow-up phase. The treatment phase consists of two periods; 2 weeks in which patients&#xD;
      will undergo two treatment sessions per week, followed by 4 weeks of a single treatment&#xD;
      session per week. The follow-up phase consists of 2 visits, one visit at week 7 and the last&#xD;
      visit at week 26. Telephone visits will be conducted between these visits. In all a patient&#xD;
      will undergo 8 treatment visits and 2 follow-up visits. Only patients not having experienced&#xD;
      an earlier recurrence will participate in the follow-up phase.&#xD;

    <description>The medical device to be investigated is named Tailored Leukapheresis (TLA) Gut™. The device comprises a column that has been designed for extracorporeal leukapheresis to specifically remove chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 9 (CCR9) expressing immunological cell populations including human leukocyte antigen DR isotype (HLA-DRhi ) monocytes from the circulation. This is achieved by integrating a strong affinity binding between the gut homing cell receptor, CCR9, and its cognate ligand, thymus-expressed chemokine (TECK) or chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25). Those blood cells that express CCR9 will bind to presented Biotinylated thymus-engineered chemokine (bTECK) on the matrix by a strong receptor ligand interaction, remaining bound to the matrix. Blood cells that do not express the receptor pass through the column unchanged and are returned to the patient.</description>
