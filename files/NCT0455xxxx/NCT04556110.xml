      In order to evaluate the bioequivalence of the test preparation and reference preparation of&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This single-center, randomized, open, single-dose, four-cycle，cross-over design&#xD;
      bioequivalence test was conducted in subjects after meal conditions. Subjects were fasted for&#xD;
      at least 10 hours over the night in each cycle，but can't ban their from drinking water.The&#xD;
      next morning，after eating a high-fat and high-calorie meal for 30 minutes, according to&#xD;
      test-reference (TR) or Reference-test (RT) sequential oral perindopril tert-butylamine&#xD;
      tablets (4 mg, 240 mL warm water). Each period was separated with a 14-day wash-out period in&#xD;
      after meal trials. The blood concentrations of perindopril and perindoprilat in qualified&#xD;
      subjects were tested. Safety assessment includes vital signs examination, physical&#xD;
      examination, laboratory safety examination, coagulation examination, electrocardiogram and&#xD;
      adverse event reports.&#xD;
