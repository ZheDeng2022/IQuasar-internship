    <textblock>
      The LIFTING trial will examine the feasibility and safety of a heavy lifting strength&#xD;
      training (HLST) program in head and neck cancer survivors (HNCS) at least 1 years post&#xD;
      surgical neck dissection. The trial will determine whether this training style is safe and&#xD;
      feasible in HNCS. Physical and psychosocial changes will also be reported.&#xD;

      RATIONALE Despite improvements in treatments, HNCS still endure numerous acute and chronic&#xD;
      side effects. Strength training has been shown to manage some of these side effects but most&#xD;
      interventions have involved light-to-moderate resistance training programs. HLST may produce&#xD;
      better outcomes but it is unknown if such a weight training program is feasible and safe for&#xD;
      HNCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE The primary aim of this proposed study is to examine the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      a HLST program in HNCS at least 1 year post-surgical neck dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This single arm feasibility study will recruit 15-20 HNCS to complete the HLST&#xD;
      program 2 times per week. The primary feasibility outcomes will include the eligibility rate&#xD;
      (with reasons for ineligibility), recruitment rate (with reasons for refusal), 1 repetition&#xD;
      maximum testing rate (with reasons for not completing the test), program adherence (including&#xD;
      attendance, dose modifications, and progression), and follow-up assessment rate (with reasons&#xD;
      for drop out). The primary efficacy outcome will be strength gains from baseline. Secondary&#xD;
      efficacy outcomes will include physical functioning, quality of life, fear of cancer&#xD;
      recurrence, pain, body composition, anxiety, fatigue, stress, shoulder mobility, self-esteem,&#xD;
      sleep, and motivation to engage in a HLST program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE Weight training is an effective intervention in HNCS but the optimal weight&#xD;
      training prescription is unknown. If heavy weight training is deemed safe and feasible in&#xD;
      HNCS, it can be compared to light-to-moderate load weight training to determine if it is a&#xD;
      better prescription for improving outcomes that are important to HNCS.&#xD;
