      Lower socioeconomic status (SES) individuals with type 1 diabetes have poorer outcomes than&#xD;
      wealthier patients and part of this disparity comes from a lack of tools and knowledge about&#xD;
      how to teach these patients on the technologies other patients take for granted. Therefore,&#xD;
      this is a study designed to develop and test low literacy English/Spanish language teaching&#xD;
      tools for patients with type 1 diabetes treated with varying types of technology in the Los&#xD;
      Angeles County healthcare system. The aims are to:To reduce health disparities for&#xD;
      underserved adults with diabetes on multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy using vials and&#xD;
      syringes through the use of a simplified lower literacy, culturally and language appropriate&#xD;
      approach to teach, implement and follow these individuals started on insulin pens and&#xD;
      pumps/continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII); To show no increase in rates of&#xD;
      diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hypoglycemia when using CSII or pen therapy compared to&#xD;
      baseline rates; To reduce time spent in hyper and hypoglycemic ranges, as well as glycemic&#xD;
      variability, as measured by blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM); Reduce psychological&#xD;
      distress due to diabetes and improve health-related quality of life, as measured by validated&#xD;
      distress and quality of life scales. Secondary Aims include: Reduction in A1C levels with&#xD;
      CSII/pen therapy compared to standard MDI treatment; and to perform a cost-analysis of the&#xD;
      process of implementation to improve the generalizability of the model.&#xD;

      SUMMARY OF STUDY RATIONAL - Lower socioeconomic status (SES) individuals with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      (T1D) have poorer outcomes than wealthier patients and part of this disparity comes from a&#xD;
      lack of tools and knowledge about how to teach these patients on the technologies other&#xD;
      patients take for granted. Until recently many of these lower SES individuals did not have&#xD;
      access to health insurance, but with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act the group&#xD;
      with the greatest expansion of coverage is the young adult age group (ages 18 - 34),&#xD;
      particularly in the Latino community. Increased insurance allows for access to newer&#xD;
      technology including insulin pens and pumps. As these patients have not had access to such&#xD;
      devices, low literacy educational tool are necessary for safe and efficient utilization.&#xD;
      Therefore, this is a study designed to develop and test low literacy English/Spanish language&#xD;
      teaching tools for patients with type 1 diabetes treated with varying types of technology in&#xD;
      the Los Angeles County (LAC) healthcare system. This study is a single center pilot study and&#xD;
      by the nature of our clinic setting it cannot be a randomized controlled trial - it is more&#xD;
      of a naturalistic experiment comparing each patient to their prior state of glycemic control&#xD;
      with their status after the educational intervention using low-literacy educational materials&#xD;
      has been applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION - Baseline Visit: Participants will sign informed consent, complete&#xD;
      questionnaires, and measure HbA1C. Those opting to do so will start a continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitor (CGM) sensor. All patients will be provided the written low literacy teaching tools&#xD;
      in the language of their choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGM Visit - for those opting to wear CGM will occur at Week 2 where 14 days of CGM data will&#xD;
      be downloaded from participants' device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education Sessions: Educational sessions will be conducted using the low-literacy tools we&#xD;
      created. Classes will be available on Fridays during T1D Clinic and on Saturdays to maximize&#xD;
      participation. Classes will be every two weeks for approximately 3 months. Classes will be&#xD;
      approximately 1 Â½ hours in duration. Patients will be encouraged but not required to attend&#xD;
      the classes. However, those starting on the pen and/or pump will be asked to attend the&#xD;
      relevant sessions to prepare them for use of the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1 - Basics of type 1 management Session 2 - Carbohydrate counting, Session 3 -&#xD;
      Insulin self- adjustment, Session 4 - Sick day rules and physical activity dose adjustments&#xD;
      Session 5 - Starting the insulin pen (for pen users) or pump (for pump users) Session 6 -&#xD;
      Trouble shooting the pump (for pump users)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone Calls - Each patient will be contacted monthly (baseline month up to month 3 visit) by&#xD;
      the diabetes educator to follow-up on questions and concerns regarding their diabetes&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Visit 2 - post education visit will occur at 3 months. Questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered, A1C measured and CGM data and compare to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Visit 3 - will occur at 6 months. Questionnaires will be administered, A1C measured&#xD;
      and CGM data and compare to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Visit 4 -will occur at 12 months. Questionnaires will be administered, A1C measured&#xD;
      and CGM data and compare to baseline and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND TESTING PROCEDURES (Baseline, 6 months and 12 months) HbA1c - HbA1c will&#xD;
      be obtained using the point of care Siemens DCA Vantage Analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)- A commercially available DexCom G5 or Libre device will&#xD;
      be provided and a sensor will be inserted. The participant will receive instructions on&#xD;
      calibration, insertions, maintenance, use, and removal of the sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1D REDEEM Diabetes Distress Questionnaire- The T1D REDEEM Diabetes Distress Questionnaire&#xD;
      measures several dimensions of stress related to having type 1 diabetes. It consists of the&#xD;
      following 7 subscales: Subscale 1 - Powerlessness (5 items); Subscale 2 - Management Distress&#xD;
      (4 items); Subscale 3 - Hypoglycemia Distress (4 items); Subscale 4 - Negative Social&#xD;
      Perceptions (4 items); Subscale 5 - Eating Distress (3 items); Subscale 6 - Physician&#xD;
      Distress (4 items); Subscale 7 - Friend/Family Distress (4 items). Each question has a&#xD;
      6-choice Likert response format. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia Fear Survey - The Hypoglycemia Fear Survey measures several dimensions of fear&#xD;
      of hypoglycemia among adults with type 1 diabetes. It consists of a 10-item Behavior subscale&#xD;
      that measured behaviors involved in avoidance and over-treatment of hypoglycemia and a&#xD;
      13-item Worry subscale that measures anxiety and fear surrounding hypoglycemia, each with a&#xD;
      5-choice Likert response format. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simplified Diabetes Knowledge Test -The Simplified Diabetes Knowledge Test consists of 23&#xD;
      knowledge test items developed by the Michigan Diabetes Research Training Center (MDRTC).&#xD;
      These items represent a test of general knowledge of diabetes and are answered in a&#xD;
      true/false/don't know format. The psychometric properties provide information regarding the&#xD;
      reliability of the various groups of items, as well as a difficulty index (percent of&#xD;
      patients who scored this item correctly), and an item to group total correlation for each&#xD;
      item. These data can be reported when describing the use of the test. Administration time is&#xD;
      approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Sever Hypoglycemia and Diabetic Ketoacidosis -The Assessment of Severe&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia and Diabetic Ketoacidosis is an interviewer administered survey assessing if the&#xD;
      subject had any episodes of severe hypoglycemia and/or diabetic ketoacidosis since their last&#xD;
      study visit. Events are recorded to assess frequency, as is type of assistance required to&#xD;
      treat the event. Administration time is approximately 5 minutes.&#xD;
