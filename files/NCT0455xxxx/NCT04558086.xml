    <description>Measurement of pin using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPS). The scale contains six cartoon faces shwing pain ratings of 0~10, which are, from left to right, no pain(0), a little pain (2), mild pain (4), average pain (6), severe pain (8), and excruciating pain (10).The children, primary caregivers, and nurses were asked to select the faces that best described the pain levels experienced by the children receiving intravenous injections; the pain levels were subsequently converted into numerical values .</description>

    <description>Measurement of fear using the Choldren Fear Scale(CFS).The scale consists of five cartoon faces showing fear ratings of 0-4, which were no fear (0), a little fear (1), some fear (2), very fear(3) and extreme fear (4). The children, primary caregivers, and nurses were asked to select the faces that best described the fear levels of the children receiving intravenous injections. The pain levels were subsequently converted into numerical values.</description>
