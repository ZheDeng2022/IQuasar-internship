      The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide PET&#xD;
      imaging in comparison with the current golden standard, 68Ga-DOTA-somatostatin analog PET, in&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumor patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Part A (main part of the trial):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-five neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients (M/F, aged 18 years and older) with a&#xD;
      routine clinical 68Ga-DOTA-somatostin analog (SSA) PET/CT performed in the last three months&#xD;
      or scheduled within three months, will undergo a whole-body Al18F-NOTA-octreotide PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 10, possibly up to 20 NET patients (M/F, aged 18 years and older) with a routine&#xD;
      clinical 68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT performed in the last three months or scheduled within three&#xD;
      months, will undergo a whole-body Al18F-NOTA-octreotide PET/MR.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Differential detection ratio (DDR)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The fraction of lesions detected by one tracer is the detection ratio. In case of non-inferiority, the difference in detection ratio on Al18F-NOTA-octerotide PET and the detection ratio on 68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET, i.e. the differential detection ratio (DDR), equals zero. The primary objective will be met if the lower margin of the 95% confidence interval for the DDR is higher than -15%. Readers will be blinded for the radiopharmaceutical that is used. (only for part A of the trial)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lesion detection rate on the organ level</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A sub analysis will be performed, involving a lesion count per organ to determine the sensitivity of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide PET and 68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET on the organ level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lesion uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements will be performed: SUVmax for lesions and SUVmean for several background areas will be determined. Lesion uptake, in terms of SUVmax and tumor-to-background ratio (TBR), will be compared for both tracers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical impact on TNM staging or patient management</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate whether different findings with both tracers have a clinical impact, e.g. leading to different TNM staging or differences in patient management. (only part A of the trial as this will be blinded)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lesion detection rate according to the specific 68Ga-DOTA-SSA used for the routine PET scan</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Due to the multicenter nature of this study, two or three different standard PET tracers will be used for the routine clinical care 68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET: 68Ga-DOTATATE (current standard in UZ Leuven), 68Ga-DOTANOC (current standard in UZ Antwerp), and potentially 68Ga-DOTATOC (depending where patients from UZ Ghent are scanned). Therefore, the diagnostic performance of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide PET will also be compared with the two or three 68Ga-DOTA-SSAs tracers separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lesion detection rate according to tumor grade</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A sub analysis will be performed, comparing the diagnostic performance and lesion uptake with Al18F-NOTA-octreotide and 68Ga-DOTA-SSA between low-grade and high-grade NETs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall diagnostic image quality according to a five-point Likert-scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>As part of an inter-observer agreement analysis, readers will score overall diagnostic image quality using a five-point Likert-scale: (1) non diagnostic, (2) poor, (3) sufficient, (4) good and (5) excellent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lesion conspicuity according to a five-point Likert-scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>As part of an inter-observer agreement analysis, readers will score lesion conspicuity relative to the surrounding background using a five-point Likert-scale: (1) no increased uptake (equal or lower than background uptake), (2) barely perceived (slightly higher than background uptake), (3) moderately detectable (higher than background uptake, but less than twice, or less than 5 standardized uptake value (SUV) units above, the background uptake), (4) definitely detected (at least twice the background uptake and at least 5 SUV units higher than background uptake) and (5) strikingly evident/easily spotted (evident on maximum intensity projection images and typically higher than uptake in all normal organs, including the spleen).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diagnostic confidence according to a five-point Likert-scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>As part of an inter-observer agreement analysis, for each focus of increased non-physiologic uptake readers will score diagnostic confidence using a five-point Likert-scale: (1) definitely no lesion, (2) probably no lesion, (3) indeterminate, (4) probably a lesion, (5) definitely a lesion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Whole-body MRI correlate of the lesions detected by the PET scans</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>For the union of lesions identified on both PET scans, MRI images will be checked for corresponding MRI lesions. If a correlating lesion is detected and deemed to be of malignant nature by an experienced whole-body MRI radiologist, the PET lesions will be considered true positives. (only part B of the trial)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide injection on blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide administration on blood pressure (in mmHg) will be assessed. This parameter and changes from baseline values will be scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide injection on heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of Al18F-NOTA-octreotide administration on heart rate (in beats per minute) will be assessed. This parameter and changes from baseline values will be scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03</description>
