  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy study in subjects with POS, with optional OLE. The study consists of 4&#xD;
      periods as follows: An 8-week of Screening/Baseline Period, 24-week of Double-blind Treatment&#xD;
      Period (including a 18-week Titration Phase and 6-week Maintenance Phase), 52-week of&#xD;
      Open-label Extension (OLE) Period (applicable for subjects who participate in the OLE) and up&#xD;
      to 5-week of End of Study (EOS) Follow-up Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 100, 200 and 400 mg/day&#xD;
      of cenobamate as adjunctive therapy compared with placebo in subjects with partial onset&#xD;
      seizures (POS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of cenobamate adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy in subjects with POS who have completed the double-blind treatment period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo an 8-week Screening/Baseline Period to assess seizure frequency.&#xD;
      Subjects with a high enough number of seizures will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive placebo or cenobamate 100, 200, or 400 mg given once per day in the morning. Subjects&#xD;
      will first enter the 18-week Titration Phase, during which the initial dose will be 12.5&#xD;
      mg/day or placebo. The dose of cenobamate will be increased in a double-blind fashion from&#xD;
      12.5 mg/day to 25 mg/day and 50 mg/day (or matching placebo) at 2-week intervals and then&#xD;
      will be titrated by 50 mg/day (or matching placebo) every 2 weeks. After 18-week&#xD;
      up-titration, subjects will enter the Maintenance Phase. During the Maintenance Phase,&#xD;
      subjects are recommended to maintain their dose for 6 weeks. Subjects who have completed the&#xD;
      Double-blind Treatment Period and who choose to participate in this OLE will enter an 18-week&#xD;
      Double-blind Conversion Phase before starting the 34-week Open-label Maintenance Phase.&#xD;
      Subjects who do not enroll into the OLE will enter a 5-week FU period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cenobamate as adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy compared with placebo in subjects with POS. The secondary objectives of this study&#xD;
      are: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of cenobamate in subjects with POS, to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of cenobamate in POS and in specified seizure types, and to assess blood plasma&#xD;
      exposure of cenobamate in subjects with POS.&#xD;

             informed consent and assent (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Weight at least 35 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Written informed consent signed by the subject prior to entering the study in&#xD;
             accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines. For all underage subjects (according to the&#xD;
             specific laws of the country) or subjects who lack the capacity, consent will be&#xD;
             obtained from the parent/legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A diagnosis of partial onset seizures according to the International League Against&#xD;
             Epilepsy's Classification of Epileptic Seizures (1981). Diagnosis should have been&#xD;
             established by clinical history and an electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. EEG performed within 5 years prior to Visit 1 that is consistent with localization&#xD;
             related epilepsy; normal interictal EEGs will be allowed provided that the subject&#xD;
             meets the other diagnosis criterion (i.e., clinical history).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Need additional antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment despite having been treated with at&#xD;
             least one AED for the last 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. During the 8-week Screening/Baseline Period, subjects must have at least 8 partial&#xD;
             seizures including only simple partial seizures with motor component, complex partial&#xD;
             seizures, or secondarily generalized seizures without a seizure-free interval of&#xD;
             greater than 25 days any time during the 8-week period. Subjects must have at least 3&#xD;
             of these partial seizures during each of the two consecutive 4-week segments of the&#xD;
             Screening/Baseline Periods, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Currently on stable antiepileptic treatment regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Subject must have been receiving stable doses of 1 to 3 AEDs for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to Visit 1 to be continued unchanged throughout the Double-blind Treatment&#xD;
                  Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) or deep brain stimulator (DBS) will not be counted&#xD;
                  as an AED; however, the parameters must remain stable for at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
                  to Visit 1 and during the study. VNS or DBS must have been implanted at least 5&#xD;
                  months prior to Visit 1.&#xD;

               3. The daily use of benzodiazepines (except for diazepam) for epilepsy, or for&#xD;
                  anxiety or sleep disorder, will be counted as 1 AED and must be continued&#xD;
                  unchanged throughout the study. Therefore, only a maximum of 2 additional&#xD;
                  approved AEDs will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subjects receiving felbamate as a concomitant AED must meet the following&#xD;
                  criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Two-year history of felbamate use and a history of a fixed dosing regimen&#xD;

             past 5 years that ruled out a progressive cause of epilepsy. If brain imaging has not&#xD;
             been performed within the past 5 years, a CT scan must be performed prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to reach subject by telephone&#xD;
&#xD;
