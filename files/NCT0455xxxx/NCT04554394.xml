  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, non-randomized, multicenter pivotal study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of the CellFX System in patients with cutaneous non-genital warts on&#xD;
      all areas of the body, excluding the face.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll healthy adult subjects with a minimum of two cutaneous non-genital&#xD;
      warts, excluding the face, with each wart lesion not exceeding 10 x 10mm. One of the warts&#xD;
      for each subject will be untreated and will serve as the subject's internal control.&#xD;
      Macrophotography of all study warts will be captured along with Investigator assessments&#xD;
      using the Wart Measurement Scale (WMS) and lesion measurements for wart reduction. All&#xD;
      subjects will be followed at 7, 30, 60, 90 and 120-days post-initial CellFX treatment. All&#xD;
      wart lesions are eligible for re-treatment up to 3 times over the course of the study.&#xD;
      Adverse events will be documented.&#xD;
