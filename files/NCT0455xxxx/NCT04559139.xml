    <textblock>
      This phase II/III trial compares the effect of adding chemotherapy before and after surgery&#xD;
      versus after surgery alone (usual treatment) in treating patients with stage II-III&#xD;
      gallbladder cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the&#xD;
      tumor smaller; therefore, may reduce the extent of surgery. Additionally, it may make it&#xD;
      easier for the surgeon to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue. Giving&#xD;
      chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. This study will determine&#xD;
      whether giving chemotherapy before surgery increases the length of time before the cancer may&#xD;
      return and whether it will increase a patient's life span compared to the usual approach.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the difference in overall survival (OS) for patients given neoadjuvant&#xD;
      gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine) and cisplatin prior to re-resection followed by&#xD;
      adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin compared to patients who receive only adjuvant gemcitabine&#xD;
      and cisplatin after re-resection for incidental gallbladder cancer (IGBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the incidence of residual disease at the time of re-resection between patients&#xD;
      with IGBC who receive perioperative chemotherapy prior to re-resection and those who receive&#xD;
      only adjuvant chemotherapy after re-resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the clinical effect of preoperative chemotherapy compared to upfront&#xD;
      re-resection on resectability among 3 cohorts: all enrolled patients, all patients who&#xD;
      undergo staging laparoscopy, and all patients who undergo laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the difference in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with IGBC&#xD;
      who receive perioperative chemotherapy prior to and after re-resection compared to patients&#xD;
      who receive only adjuvant chemotherapy after re-resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Within 4 weeks of randomization, patients undergo surgery to remove part of the liver,&#xD;
      the lymph nodes around the liver, and possibly the bile ducts. Patients then receive&#xD;
      gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes-24 hours on&#xD;
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin over 30 minutes-24&#xD;
      hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 4-8 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, patients whose disease has not spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastasized) undergo surgery as in Arm I. Patients with successful surgery then resume&#xD;
      treatment with gemcitabine IV and cisplatin IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
      days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 1 year after surgery or until disease recurrence, whichever comes&#xD;
      first, for up to 5 years.&#xD;

             of childbearing potential is defined as any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or&#xD;
             whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has&#xD;

             oophorectomy; or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer&#xD;
             therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months&#xD;
