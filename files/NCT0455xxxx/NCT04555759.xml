  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There exist a variety of outcome measures to asses gait function in individuals with a spinal&#xD;
      cord injury (SCI). The most established measures are the 10-meter walk test (10MWT) and the&#xD;
      6-minute walk test (6mWT). They are used to assess treatment efficacy and recovery of gait&#xD;
      function in individuals with SCI. However, the 10MWT is appropriate for poor walkers but not&#xD;
      sensitive in good walkers and the 6mWT can be time-consuming and is very demanding for&#xD;
      severely impaired patients. Therefore the 2-minute walk test (2mWT) has gained more attention&#xD;
      in the SCI field. The 2mWT has been established in numerous neurological diseases and has&#xD;
      shown to correlate with the 6mWT in patients with neuromuscular disease, multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      and stroke. Though the 2mWT has not yet been validated in individuals with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limitation that affects all timed walking tests is that they suffer from limited&#xD;
      information about gait quality (i.e. how walking function is achieved). Being able to receive&#xD;
      information on the gait quality of a patient can help to understand the underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      of walking improvements after an intervention (e.g. compensation vs recovery). The research&#xD;
      in the field of inertia measuring units (IMU) develops and advances very rapidly at the&#xD;
      moment resulting in the possibility to perform a gait analysis with a simple IMU setup.&#xD;
      However, the reliability of such measurement setups has not yet been shown in individuals&#xD;
      with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to test the validity and reliability of the 2mWT in the SCI&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, it will be investigated if a simple sensor setup can give additional reliable&#xD;
      information about the gait pattern of individuals with SCI.&#xD;
