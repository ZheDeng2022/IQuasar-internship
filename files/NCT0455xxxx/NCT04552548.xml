      The aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare the analgesic effect of&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided Quadratus Lumborum Block with ultrasound-guided Transversus Abdominis plane&#xD;
      block in pediatric Laparoscopic lower abdominal surgeries&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      90 male and female patients aged from 1 to 7 years old from ASA class I to II undergoing&#xD;
      elective laparoscopic lower abdominal surgery will be randomly divided into three equal&#xD;
      groups of thirty patients each by using computer generated random table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique of the study After insertion of venous access, all children received premedication&#xD;
      in the form of atropine at a dose of 0.01-0.02 mg/kg. Perioperative monitoring included&#xD;
      continuous ECG, pulse oximetry and non-invasive arterial blood pressure. Baseline reading of&#xD;
      heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure was recorded after monitor attachment. General&#xD;
      anesthesia will be induced using propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg over 20-30 sec. as tolerated,&#xD;
      atracurium 0.5 mg/kg to facilitate endotracheal intubation and fentanyl 1 µg/kg. Anesthesia&#xD;
      will be maintained using isoflurane (1 MAC) and atracurium 0.1 mg/kg supplements will be&#xD;
      given to maintain muscle relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAP block or quadratus lumborum block will be performed in all patients immediately after&#xD;
      induction and before starting of surgery. patients will be allocated randomly into three&#xD;
      equal groups , 30 patients in each as the following :-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C &quot;Control group&quot; will receive regular analgesics (1 µg /kg fentanyl with induction and&#xD;
      15mg/kg paracetamol before extubation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group TAP &quot;TAP group&quot; will receive bilateral TAP block using (0.5 ml/ kg bupivacaine 0.25%)&#xD;
      in each side + regular analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group QL&quot;quadratus lumborum group&quot; will receive bilateral quadratus lumborum block using (0.5&#xD;
      ml/ kg bupivacaine 0.25%) in each side + regular analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAP block procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the patient in the supine position, the site of the ultrasound and needle entry was&#xD;
      sterilized. The TAP block will be performed laterally behind the midaxillary line between the&#xD;
      iliac crest and the most inferior extent of the ribs. The plane between the internal oblique&#xD;
      and transversus abdominis muscle located around the midaxillary line with the probe&#xD;
      transverse to the abdomen. Anteriorly, the needle passes to come perpendicular to the&#xD;
      ultrasound beam and placed between transversus and internal oblique posterior to the&#xD;
      midaxillary line. Then, the local anesthetic will be injected. QL block prcedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      bilateral ultrasound guided transmuscular quadrates lumborum (TQL) block was given SONOSITE&#xD;
      NANOMAX; the scanning probe was the linear 25N multifrequency 13-6 MHz transducer (L25x13-6&#xD;
      MHz linear array) made in USA. In lateral position, the side to be blocked was kept up and&#xD;
      probe was placed in the midaxillary line in the transverse plane immediately above the iliac&#xD;
      crest and then it was slided dorsally till the Shamrock sign was clearly identified. In&#xD;
      &quot;Shamrock sign&quot; The quadratus lumborum (QL) muscle is seen as a superior leaf of the Shamrock&#xD;
      at the apex of the transverse process (TP) of L4, erector spinae (ES) muscles make up the&#xD;
      posterior leaf, psoas major (PM) muscle makes the anterior leaf and the transverse process&#xD;
      (TP) represents the stem connecting the 3leaves. A 22-G 90-mm spinal needle was inserted from&#xD;
      the posterior end of the probe and directed for the fascial plane between the QL and PM&#xD;
      muscles through the QL muscle. Once needle was confirmed at correct location the drug was&#xD;
      injected. Other side was also injected in similar manner. The parents were not aware of group&#xD;
      allocation as the block was done after induction of anesthesia. An independent&#xD;
      anesthesiologist conducted postoperative assessments and was not aware of group allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical intervention was started 15 min after QL block. Pneumoperitoneum was maintained&#xD;
      at a flow rate of 0.5 L/min and a pressure of 8-12 mm Hg with CO2 insufflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of surgical procedure anesthesia was discontinued, muscle relaxant reversed&#xD;
      using atropine 0.02 mg/kg and 0.05 mg/kg of prostigmine. Paracetamol infusion (15 mg/kg) will&#xD;
      be given by intravenous infusion before extubation. After extubation transfer the children to&#xD;
      PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively pain will be assessed using FLACC score (face, leg, activity, cry and&#xD;
      consolability) as shown in the table below. Acetaminophine (perfalgan) 15 mg/kg IV will be&#xD;
      given as rescue analgesia for patients if FLACC score &gt;4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters will be assessed&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Preoperative and intraoperative measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hemodynamic parameters: HR, MAP and SaO2 were recorded before and immediately after&#xD;
           induction of anesthesia, at the time of puncture of the prop and then every 5 min&#xD;
           intervals until the end of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analgesic requirement: all through the procedure (by measuring the analgesic need intra&#xD;
           operative in the form of fentanyl 0.5 µg/kg) in case of increase in intraoperative mean&#xD;
           arterial blood pressure or heart rate of more than 20% of baseline for longer than 5&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of complications: in the form of hemodynamic instability, injury to the&#xD;
           underlying structures, and hematoma formation as recorded under ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Postoperative measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The number of patients who require rescue analgesia in the first 24 h. 2. Quality of&#xD;
      analgesia: it will be assessed immediately postoperatively, every 30min in the PACU and then&#xD;
      at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and 24 h postoperatively using FLACC score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Time to the first analgesic requirement: Duration of analgesia was defined as the time&#xD;
      interval from completion of local anesthetic administration till first need of rescue&#xD;
      analgesic (FLACC&gt;4) in the form of IV paracetamol 15mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each category is scored on the 0-2 scale, which results in a total score of 0-10. 0 Relaxed&#xD;
      and comfortable 1-3 Mild discomfort Behaviour 0 1 2 Face No particular expression or smile&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occasional grimace or frown, withdrawn, disinterested&#xD;

      and the numbers of analgesic doses in 24h. 5. Hemodynamic data: HR, MAP and SaO2 were&#xD;
      recorded up to 120 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. length of hospital stay and patients or parents satisfaction assessed on a 5point scale.&#xD;
      1-completely dissatisfied, 2-dissatisfied, 3-not satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4- satisfied&#xD;
      5-completely satisfied 7. Postoperative complication: including postoperative hypotention or&#xD;

    <description>Abdominal field blocks have been used in anesthesia for surgery involving the anterior abdominal wall with ultrasound-guided technique. TAP block is a regional anesthetic technique that blocks neural afferents of the anterolateral abdominal wall. Using anatomical landmark guidance or with the aid of ultrasound (US), local anesthetic is injected into the transversus abdominis fascial plane, where the nerves from T6 to L1 are located. Ultrasound-guided quadratus lumborum (QL) block is considered now as one of the novel truncal abdominal blocks, as it is effective in preventing somatic pain associated with upper and lower abdominal surgeries.</description>
