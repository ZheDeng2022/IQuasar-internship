      Environment which children live and grown is very important for the all development stages.&#xD;
      In Turkey there is no measurement for home environment evaluation so our aim is to&#xD;
      investigate the Psychometric Properties of the Turkish version of Affordances in the Home&#xD;
      Environment for Motor Development-Infant Scale (AHEMD-IS) in a sample of Turkısh children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With the advances in technology and medical fields, the rate of cerebral palsy is increasing&#xD;
      worldwide with the increase in the survival rate of preterm, low birth weight babies and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmentally risky babies living in neonatal intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Classification of Health, Function and Disability - Child and Youth version&#xD;
      (ICF-CY), developed by the World Health Organization, provides a common language to record&#xD;
      problems involving functions and structures of the body, restrictions of activity and&#xD;
      participation that occur in childhood and adolescence, and related environmental factors; and&#xD;
      It was developed to use terminology and consists of four main components: &quot;Body Functions&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;Body Structures&quot;, &quot;Activity and Participation&quot;, &quot;Environmental Factors&quot;. According to&#xD;
      ICF-CY, environmental factors that have an effect on activity and participation are&#xD;
      changeable factors. Therefore, it is stated that environmental conditions should be changed,&#xD;
      redesigned and the child-supportive environment should be increased in order to increase the&#xD;
      level of activity and participation in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preschool children spend most of their time at home and playing games. Toys in the game&#xD;
      environment, playmates, parental participation and attitude play a major role in the&#xD;
      development of the child's motor and cognitive skills and social participation (6, 7). In&#xD;
      recent years, the importance and positive effects of the enriched environment on the motor&#xD;
      and cognitive development of babies have been emphasized in studies. Regular neuromotor&#xD;
      evaluations and follow-up of risky babies are guiding in establishing an early intervention&#xD;
      program. The &quot;Affordances in the Home Environment for Motor Development-Infant Scale&#xD;
      (AHEMD-IS)&quot; scale, developed to evaluate the characteristics of the environment in which&#xD;
      babies live, is a valid and reliable scale that is frequently used in the literature in many&#xD;
      different areas such as hearing loss, motor developmental delay, sensory impairment, and&#xD;
      typical development. is a scale (8-11). Translation has been done in many different languages&#xD;
      so far. Turkish infants at risk on a scale to evaluate the home environment in Turkey within&#xD;
      our existing information is not yet available. It is thought that the introduction of the&#xD;
      AHEMD-IS scale into the Turkish language will give clinicians and academicians a different&#xD;
      perspective in the evaluation of risky babies and children.&#xD;

Questions are answered in three categories: dichotomous, 4-degree likert and explanation-based. Higher scores means good environmental enrichment.</description>
