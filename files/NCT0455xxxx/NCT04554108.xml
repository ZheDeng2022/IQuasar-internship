  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of bone and joint infections (BJI) in children (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis&#xD;
      and spondylodiscitis) is 22 per 100,000 children in France. Every year, 3,000 children are&#xD;
      hospitalized for BJI, 46% of whom are hospitalized for osteomyelitis. The clinical pictures&#xD;
      of BJI are varied: some are severe from the outset; others are non-severe, such as BJIs in&#xD;
      Kingella kingae, which are most common in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years.&#xD;
      Currently, the management of children's BJI, regardless of their severity, involves initial&#xD;
      hospitalization to start intravenous antibiotic therapy. This non-inferiority trial&#xD;
      evaluates, in children with acute osteomyelitis with no severity criteria, less invasive&#xD;
      outpatient management with an oral antibiotic treatment given at the outset compared to&#xD;
      standard management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective : Demonstrate the non-inferiority of an ambulatory management strategy versus&#xD;
      a standard strategy involving hospitalization on complete recovery without relapse at 6&#xD;
      months after an episode of acute osteomyelitis in children aged 1-4 years without severity&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Complete cure without relapse at 6 months defined by the absence of&#xD;
      clinical signs of osteomyelitis at 6 months AND the absence of secondary septic complications&#xD;
      (septic arthritis, periosteal abscess) before the end of antibiotic therapy AND the absence&#xD;
      of relapse or rehospitalization for osteomyelitis related to the initial infection. This&#xD;
      criterion will be assessed blindly by an adjudication committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial of non inferiority, with active control, in open multi-center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control or experimental arm allocation (1:1 ratio) will be open-label of the physician,&#xD;
      patient and parents. This is a PROBE study: The evaluation of the main judgment criterion&#xD;
      will be carried out blindly by an adjudication committee.&#xD;
