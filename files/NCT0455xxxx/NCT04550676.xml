  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, randomized, single-blind (researchers), active treatment concurrent&#xD;
      control trial with individuals aged 50-80 living with HIV who experience fatigue and live a&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle. The overall goals of this proposal are to determine whether&#xD;
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can overcome physical function impairments and&#xD;
      increased fatigue (Aim 1) and impairments in mitochondrial bioenergetics of older people with&#xD;
      HIV (PWH) to a greater extent than continuous moderate-intensity exercise (CME) (Aim 2). The&#xD;
      investigators further seek to determine whether a biobehavioral coaching intervention&#xD;
      following either HIIT or CME can promote long-term adherence to physical activity (Aim 3), a&#xD;
      crucial component of the sustainability of the intervention. This study will enroll 200&#xD;
      participants in Aurora, Colorado and Cleveland, Ohio, and includes 20 visits over a one-year&#xD;
      period. Data collection will occur at each visit, with baseline data collected at the initial&#xD;
      visit. A 3-month follow-up will be conducted over the phone from the date of the final visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, randomized, single-blind (researchers), active treatment concurrent&#xD;
      control trial with individuals aged 50 and older living with HIV who experience fatigue and&#xD;
      live a sedentary lifestyle. The overall goals of this proposal are to determine whether&#xD;
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can overcome physical function impairments and&#xD;
      increased fatigue (Aim 1) and impairments in mitochondrial bioenergetics of older people with&#xD;
      HIV (PWH) to a greater extent than continuous moderate-intensity exercise (CME) (Aim 2). The&#xD;
      investigators further seek to determine whether a biobehavioral coaching intervention&#xD;
      following either HIIT or CME can promote long-term adherence to physical activity (Aim 3), a&#xD;
      crucial component of the sustainability of the intervention. This study will enroll 200&#xD;
      participants in Aurora, Colorado and Cleveland, Ohio, and includes 20 visits over a one-year&#xD;
      period. Data collection will occur at each visit, with baseline data collected at the initial&#xD;
      visit. A 3-month follow-up will be conducted over the phone from the date of the final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical function will be measured by a 400-meter walk test (400MWT) and the short physical&#xD;
      performance battery in its original (SPPB) and modified (mSPPB) forms. Fatigue will be&#xD;
      measured by the Lee Fatigue Scale (LFS) - a 7-item visual analog self-report scale that asks&#xD;
      participants to rate from 0 to 10 how they feel &quot;right now.&quot; Mitochondrial bioenergetics will&#xD;
      be assessed through blood draws, muscle biopsies and mitochondrial assays. Adherence to&#xD;
      physical activity (PA) will be analyzed through ActiGraphy - measurement of PA duration and&#xD;
      intensity on three planes of movement captured through PA monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, perceptions of PA will be determined through the analysis of qualitative interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are that that investigators will see greater changes in mitochondrial&#xD;
      bioenergetics with HIIT (AIM 1), and that these changes will be related to improved physical&#xD;
      function and fatigue (Aim 2). The investigators expect that HIIT will result in greater&#xD;
      exercise satisfaction and likelihood of long-term continuation of exercise (Aim 3). Using a&#xD;
      coaching intervention for self-directed exercise that combines motivational interviewing and&#xD;
      personalized support during the maintenance phase (Aim 3), the investigators seek to develop&#xD;
      the ideal &quot;cocktail&quot; to promote healthspan among older PWH in the current era of ART.&#xD;

This is followed by a 5-minute cool-down. The total exercise time will be 42 minutes.
