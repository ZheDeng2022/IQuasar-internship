  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity of stroke patient, a very common complication in clinical practice, affects&#xD;
      performance of hand function and gait pattern. It also interferes with quality of life of&#xD;
      patients severely. Currently first line clinical approach to spasticity consist of physical&#xD;
      therapy and pharmacological management. However, there are still some refractory cases that&#xD;
      needed local intervention such as Botox injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, we only can use subjective methods to measure muscle tension, such as modified&#xD;
      Ashworth scale and Tone Assessment Scale. In our previous study, we found that ultrasound&#xD;
      shear wave image could correlate with muscle stiffness caused by poststroke spasticity. With&#xD;
      this new method, we aim to establish a more objective method in measuring abnormal poststroke&#xD;
      muscle tension before and after treatments and further monitor therapeutic effect. We also&#xD;
      include several assessment scales to evaluate the correlation between measured muscle spasm&#xD;
      and activity of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the rheological changes in muscles muscle spasm after Botox injection can&#xD;
      be detected by ultrasound shear wave image. Therapeutic effect can also be seen in its effect&#xD;
      on daily functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we will use shear wave imaging of ultrasound to investigate the elasticity&#xD;
      (and hardness) of the biceps brachii and brachialis muscle in stroke patients with unilateral&#xD;
      hemiplegia before and after Botox injection. The findings of this project will provide the&#xD;
      objective evaluation of muscle spasticity and its correlation with functional status, which&#xD;
      will provide new points of view toward treatment of spasticity.&#xD;
