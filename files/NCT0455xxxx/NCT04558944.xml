  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, controlled study. The patients were divided into two groups with&#xD;
      twenty patients per group. The control group received the standard treatment for postburn&#xD;
      scars. The treatment group received the standard treatment and treatment of postburn scars&#xD;
      with Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy 512 impulses of 0.15mJ/mm 2 in each session, twice per&#xD;
      week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators assessed the appearance of scar with the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS),&#xD;
      pruritus and pain with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before the start of the treatment and at 2&#xD;
      weeks and 5 months after the treatment.&#xD;

    <description>This group received pain and pruritus medication as needed, received the usual physical therapy as per the protocol of our burn unit, as well as compression garments, silicone sheets and gels and moisturizing cream twice a day. Additionally, the patients were advice on reducing sun exposure and applying +50SPF sunblock on a daily basis.</description>
