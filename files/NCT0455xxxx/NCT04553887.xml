    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and the safety/ tolerability of Almonertinib&#xD;
      in NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR Mutation or EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Patients&#xD;
      with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have to had at least one prior systemic treatment for&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.&#xD;
