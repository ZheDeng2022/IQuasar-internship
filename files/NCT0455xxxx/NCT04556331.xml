  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To pilot a brief group early intervention aimed at reducing or preventing the&#xD;
      intergenerational transmission of anxiety, with parents whose child is between 12 and 47&#xD;
      months. To explore feasibility and acceptability of such an intervention with this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will attend two group sessions of 'psychoeducation' (psychologically&#xD;
      informed information about the topic of transmitting anxiety) and cognitive-behavioural&#xD;
      strategies aimed at reducing the transmission of anxiety from parent to young child. The two&#xD;
      sessions will be delivered online via Microsoft Teams, last 2 hours each and will run one&#xD;
      week apart. Outcome and acceptability measures will be collected before, immediately after,&#xD;
      and 6 weeks after the intervention. Feasibility data (e.g. drop-out rate) will be recorded.&#xD;
