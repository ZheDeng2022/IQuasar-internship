  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define and characterize important subtypes of patients with&#xD;
      urinary urgency to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology, risk factors,&#xD;
      experiences, and comorbidities to lay the foundation for more effective treatment by focusing&#xD;
      on the most bothersome and difficult to treat symptoms of urinary urgency and urgency urinary&#xD;
      incontinence.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LURN is pursuing deeper phenotyping of patients with urinary urgency and UUI using distinct,&#xD;
      but related, projects. The Urinary Urgency Phenotyping Protocol is the overarching effort,&#xD;
      and will comprise five integrated projects. Project A, the Observational Cohort, will be a&#xD;
      large-scale accrual of male and female participants with urinary urgency and age-matched&#xD;
      controls without any LUTS. Standardized clinical data, comprising information typically&#xD;
      gathered at the patient clinic encounter, self-report symptom, urologic and non-urologic&#xD;
      data, and biosamples will be collected. Using this group of participants, subsets will be&#xD;
      identified for more focused and in-depth studies of urinary urgency and urgency incontinence.&#xD;
      This more focused effort will be conducted as Project B: the Central Sensitization Study;&#xD;
      Project C: the Physical Activity and Sleep Study; Project D: the Organ-Based Study; and&#xD;
      Project E: the Qualitative Assessment of Patients with Urinary Urgency Study.&#xD;
