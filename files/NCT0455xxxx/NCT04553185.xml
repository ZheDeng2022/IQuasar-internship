    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between problems in sleep,&#xD;
      genetic variations in the Aquaporin-4 gene (AQP4), and the development of Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the&#xD;
      abnormal deposition in the brain of aggregates called Lewy Bodies, packed with a protein&#xD;
      called α-synuclein. The mechanisms why this protein accumulates in the brain of patients with&#xD;
      PD, as well as its relationship with clinical symptoms, is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, an internal mechanism of drainage of waste proteins called glymphatic system has&#xD;
      been identified and characterized. This system is silent during wakefulness and works during&#xD;
      sleep. When it is active, a virtual space between the blood capillaries and cells of the&#xD;
      brain called astrocytes opens and lets out waste products from the brain. This process is&#xD;
      mediated by a protein of the astrocytes called Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Preclinical studies have&#xD;
      shown that the function of this system could be critical for the clearance of β-amyloid, a&#xD;
      protein linked with the development of Alzheimer's Disease. Studies in humans have shown that&#xD;
      genetic variations some parts of the AQP4 gene, defined as single nucleotide polymorphisms,&#xD;
      may increase the likelihood to develop an aggressive form of Alzheimer's Disease. However, no&#xD;
      studies in humans have ever been performed in Parkinson's disease and α-synuclein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to elucidate whether genetic variations in the AQP4 gene&#xD;
      contribute to variations in the clinical presentation and progression of sporadic and genetic&#xD;
      forms of Parkinson's disease. To do so, the genetic profile of patients will be determined&#xD;
      through a small venous blood sample collection. This will be coupled with clinical and sleep&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
