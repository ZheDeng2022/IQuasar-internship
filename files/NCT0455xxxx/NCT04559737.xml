  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a study to formally compare two Continuous Positive Airway Pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) follow-up pathways: 1) Usual care - follow-up visits reflect standard care practice&#xD;
      and we rely on patients to reach out to us if they are struggling with therapy (there will be&#xD;
      no active outreach); 2) Case Management - in addition to &quot;Usual Care&quot; visits, patients CPAP&#xD;
      use will be monitored and further encounters may be initiated with &quot;struggler&quot; CPAP users&#xD;
      while &quot;successful&quot; users are passively followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate measures of CPAP adherence, patient engagement and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness for the duration of 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that &quot;Case Management&quot; will improve CPAP adherence and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      compared to &quot;Usual Care&quot;. The investigators also hypothesize that targeting &quot;strugglers&quot; only&#xD;
      in a management by exception (MBE) approach will be equally effective, but require less&#xD;
      personnel time compared to targeting &quot;all&quot; patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases patient risks and burden on the healthcare&#xD;
      system due to its high prevalence, impact on cardiovascular health, and daytime symptoms that&#xD;
      cause deficits on daytime functioning. The yearly economic cost of OSA in Australia, with a&#xD;
      population of about 25 million, is estimated to be $21 billion. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on improving patient and&#xD;
      population outcomes is limited by suboptimal adherence with literature generally reporting&#xD;
      adherence rates of 50-70% (defined by Medicare as ≥70% nights used ≥4 hours). The development&#xD;
      of technology-based solutions is critical towards improving adherence, and this includes the&#xD;
      use of remote patient monitoring, automation, and population management tools. Current CPAP&#xD;
      devices are now wirelessly connected (eg, via cellular) which enables remote access by sleep&#xD;
      medicine providers to access patient usage. Fox et al demonstrated the utility of remote&#xD;
      monitoring in a randomized trial. New CPAP users that were remotely identified to have&#xD;
      suboptimal use (and underwent a telephone encounter with a sleep medicine provider) showed&#xD;
      significantly better 3 month CPAP use compared to the control group without monitoring (321&#xD;
      minutes versus 207 minutes; p&lt;0.0001). Our center also performed a randomized trial (Tele-OSA&#xD;
      study) in which a similar process was applied but the monitoring and patient feedback was&#xD;
      automated. Patients with &lt;4 hours use for 3 nights in a row were automatically sent messages&#xD;
      (typically via SMS text) encouraging use. The investigators demonstrated the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of this automated approach (Auto-Monitoring), which resulted in improved&#xD;
      CPAP adherence without an increase in manual intervention with a provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population management platforms capable of automatically risk stratifying patients (eg,&#xD;
      automatically identifying poor users) may be another cost-effective technology-based tool by&#xD;
      enabling a &quot;management by exception&quot; (MBE) follow-up process. This process concentrates&#xD;
      provider effort on patients most at need by allowing providers to passively observe&#xD;
      successful users and actively intervene only in CPAP strugglers. In our center, the&#xD;
      investigators intend to implement this population management process by identifying CPAP&#xD;
      strugglers at 1 month, 2 month, and 3 months after therapy initiation although impact on&#xD;
      outcomes is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Motion Pilot&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our center proceeded with a preliminary implementation of this automated MBE process and&#xD;
      performed a time motion study comparing time required to deliver care utilizing the&#xD;
      population management process with automated risk stratification versus a non-automated&#xD;
      process. The tasks performed were as follows: 1) Risk stratification (identifying patients&#xD;
      with moderate-severe OSA), assessing CPAP Adherence (identifying those with &gt;50% nights used&#xD;
      at least 4 hours), telephone encounter (to troubleshoot issues with CPAP use), and&#xD;
      documentation. The investigators demonstrated an 83% reduction in time required to follow-up&#xD;
      a similar population of new CPAP users at any given time point (eg, 1 month, 2 months, etc.)&#xD;
      While the results of this pilot (unpublished data) demonstrates significant improvement in&#xD;
      care delivery efficiency, the impact on adherence remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Management Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a study to formally compare two CPAP follow-up pathways: 1) Usual&#xD;
      care - a control group utilizing standard care practices with no active outreach; 2) Case&#xD;
      Management - in addition to &quot;Usual Care&quot;, other encounters may be initiated with CPAP&#xD;
      strugglers while successful users are passively followed.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive Auto-Monitoring text messages. The Auto-Monitoring tool that will be used is a function within Somnoware (Somnoware, Inc.) patient management platform, which is the national KP benchmarked platform for sleep management software. Fixed scheduled follow-up visits will be scheduled at 1-month (telephone encounter), 3-months (in-person or video encounter), and 1-year (in-person or video encounter). This sequence of follow-up visits reflects current real-world practice. Patients are eligible for additional visits when self-initiated. Sleep questionnaires will be delivered at 1, 3, and 6 months and at 1 year.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo the same follow-up process as described in the Usual Care Pathway. A population CM dashboard (Somnoware, Inc.) will be used to automatically identify PAP strugglers (defined as &lt;70% nights with ≥4 hours use during the preceding month) for 1 year. Video encounters will be triggered for these select patients for troubleshooting. Additionally, throughout this 1-year period, Q1 window of &lt;70% nights &gt;4 hours will trigger a phone call and at the discretion of the case manager convert to video or in-person encounter for troubleshooting. CPAP Follow-Up Questionnaire will also be delivered to patient at 3 months and 1 year.</description>
