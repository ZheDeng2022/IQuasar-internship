  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, fixed sequence, pharmacokinetic interaction study&#xD;
      between bictegravir and tenofovir alafenamide with rifapentine dosed either daily or weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of once-weekly rifapentine on the steady-state PK of BIC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of once-daily rifapentine on the steady-state PK of BIC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of daily dosed rifapentine on steady-state PK of TAF (measured as&#xD;
           plasma and IC concentrations of TFV-DP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect and timing of interactions of weekly dosed rifapentine on&#xD;
           steady-state PK of TAF (measured as plasma and IC concentrations of TFV-DP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of BIC/TAF/FTC when coadministered with once-weekly or once-daily&#xD;
           rifapentine&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive once-daily Biktarvy for 4 weeks to ensure all moieties of interest&#xD;
      reach steady-state prior to the baseline PK assessment. Thereafter, subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      in one of two groups for PK analysis as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group one will continue Biktarvy and have rifapentine dosed daily for 4 weeks (10 mg/kg;&#xD;
      600mg dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group two will continue Biktarvy and have rifapentine dosed weekly for 4 weeks (15 mg/kg;&#xD;
      900mg dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 weeks of Biktarvy dosing, subjects will have a baseline intensive PK of plasma&#xD;
      bictegravir (BIC), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), tenofovir (TFV) levels at all time points,&#xD;
      and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be collected at 24 hours post-dose for IC&#xD;
      TFV-DP. This will occur prior to receiving their first dose of directly observed oral&#xD;
      rifapentine co-administered with Biktarvy, thus serving as their own control. Rifapentine&#xD;
      will thereafter be administered by directly observed therapy (DOT) or ingestion monitored by&#xD;
      smart phone application (e.g., Time Stamp App or other phone app platform). Intensive PK&#xD;
      assessments will be repeated after 4 weeks of RPT dosing for both Group 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive PK sampling will be performed at time 0 (pre-dose), 15 and 30 min; 1, 2, 3, 4, 8,&#xD;
      12 and 24 hours post-dose with BIC/TAF/FTC alone and when coadministered with rifapentine.&#xD;
      Plasma will be isolated at all time points, and PBMCs will be isolated at 24 hours post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK levels will be measured by colleagues at the Colorado Antiviral Pharmacology (CAVP)&#xD;
      Laboratory at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      BIC, TAF, TFV, and IC TFV-DP in PBMCs will be measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry.&#xD;
