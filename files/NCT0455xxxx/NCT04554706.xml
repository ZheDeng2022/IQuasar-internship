      This clinical trial intends to study the efficacy of a mobile phone delivered intervention in&#xD;
      reducing depression-related rumination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Here we propose to test a novel intervention to help individuals manage their depressive&#xD;
      rumination. The intervention is based on a just-in-time, adaptive-intervention (JITAI)&#xD;
      design. A JITAI is &quot;an intervention designed to address the dynamically changing needs of&#xD;
      individuals via the provision of the type/amount of support needed, at the right time, and&#xD;
      only when needed .&quot; This study is also to address one major concern regarding designing JITAI&#xD;
      interventions: the burden on participants in having to be engaged with the intervention&#xD;
      through diaries, self-reports, and other forms of assessment procedures daily. To reduce this&#xD;
      burden, we first pilot test an interactive narrative form. An interactive narrative is an&#xD;
      essential form of storytelling that involves certain interactive features such that audiences&#xD;
      or readers of the story can have the feeling that they are actively engaging in certain forms&#xD;
      of interactions with the story characters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the efficacy of such an intervention, there will be a one-month three-arm clinical&#xD;
      control trial to reduce depressive rumination. There are three conditions: a JITAI&#xD;
      interactive narrative condition, a non-narrative JTIAI condition, and a wait-list control&#xD;
      condition. This study could contribute to our knowledge in designing more effective&#xD;
      interventions in curbing depression using mobile technology. It can also advance our&#xD;
      theoretical knowledge of the role of interactive narratives in reducing user burden in mobile&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
