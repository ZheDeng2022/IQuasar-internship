  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of oral chemotherapy,&#xD;
      for its comfort and for allowing a higher quality of life. However, one of the main drawbacks&#xD;
      is the lack of adherence to treatment with important clinical, social and economic&#xD;
      consequences. In this scenario, the investigators did not have a questionnaire designed and&#xD;
      validated to measure adherence in onco-hematological patients, a population that was&#xD;
      erroneously considered very adherent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the investigators is to build and validate a questionnaire to measure&#xD;
      adherence to treatment in oncohematological patients in treatment with oral anti-cancer&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: An observational study to validate questionnaires will be carried out&#xD;
      combining qualitative and quantitative research techniques. With the results of a systematic&#xD;
      review of the literature and a qualitative study based on focus groups, a questionnaire will&#xD;
      be designed to measure adherence in oncohematological patients in treatment with with oral&#xD;
      anti-cancer drugs. The investigators will include patiens from two hospitals in the Valencian&#xD;
      Community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: It is essential to have a simple, reliable and validated instrument for measuring&#xD;
      adherence in cancer patients undergoing treatment with oral antineoplastic agents. With this,&#xD;
      lack of therapeutic compliance and its causes can be detected in order to establish&#xD;
      interventions that improve it.&#xD;
