  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FK506 (tacrolimus), a calcineurin inhibitor, is widely used as an immunosuppressant to lower&#xD;
      the risk of organ rejection after organ transplantation, and to treat T cell-mediated&#xD;
      diseases such as eczema and atopic dermatitis. FK506 treatment often accompanies pain&#xD;
      sensation in patients with atopic dermatitis or after organ transplantation. In previous&#xD;
      studies, we confirmed that FK506 treatment increased neuronal activity of primary afferent&#xD;
      neurons and causes pain behavior in naïve mice. In order to further search for objective&#xD;
      clinical evidence, we proposed to investigate pain incidence after FK506 immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapy in liver transplantation patients. We will investigate pain incidence and pain&#xD;
      intensity in patients who underwent liver transplant from September of 2011 to May of 2018 in&#xD;
      the Liver Health Rehabilitation Association. The patients who were divided into two groups&#xD;
      based on whether or not FK506 was used in the immunosuppressive therapy. The patients in&#xD;
      control group (without FK506 treatment) and FK506-treated group report pain sensation 3&#xD;
      months and 12 months after liver transplant. We will compare the pain incidence between the&#xD;
      two groups at both time points. On the other hand, we will further investigate changes in&#xD;
      pain sensation after 1st and 2nd reductions of FK506 dose. Pain is reported subjectively by&#xD;
      the patient using the visual analogue scale (VAS) 1 month after dose reduction. In our study,&#xD;
      1st and 2nd reductions of FK506 dose refers to the first two dose-adjustments (approximately&#xD;
      6 months apart) that occurred 3-6 months after the liver transplantation.&#xD;
