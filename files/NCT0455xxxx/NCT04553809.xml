    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer related deaths in Denmark. In order to improve the&#xD;
      prognosis diagnosis in earlier stages are needed. This will however require improved sampling&#xD;
      techniques from very small lung lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One method involves the use of a radial ultrasound probe inserted in the working channel of&#xD;
      the bronchoscope, to more accurately identify the lung lesions before sampling them (rEBUS).&#xD;
      The other method involves the use of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) to guide&#xD;
      the operator to the lung lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine whether a combination of rEBUS and ENB is superior to ENB alone&#xD;
      in biopsy sampling. The study will be conducted as a non-blinded RCT. Furthermore, we will&#xD;
      make an estimate of the hospital costs of the entire diagnostic work up for lung cancer when&#xD;
      combining ENB and rEBUS compared to ENB alone.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite recent years' improvement regarding the treatment of lung cancer, it remains the&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer deaths in Denmark. This is partly due to many patients being&#xD;
      diagnosed in an advanced stage limiting the possibilities of curative treatment. Much&#xD;
      attention has therefore been aimed at developing tools for early identification of patients&#xD;
      with possible lung cancer . Screening or easy access to CT of the chest may help to identify&#xD;
      patients with possible early stage lung cancer. Performing biopsies of small lung lesions in&#xD;
      a safe manner without inexpedient complications, however, is an ongoing diagnostic challenge&#xD;
      especially for the increasing elderly patient population and patients with decreased lung&#xD;
      function. If patients are to benefit from an improved identification of possible early stage&#xD;
      lung cancer, it is necessary to also further improve the methods for obtaining biopsies in&#xD;
      this patient population in order to decrease the morbidity during the diagnostic work-up and&#xD;
      to prepare the patients for treatment in a secure manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current methods for performing biopsies of small lung lesions are transthoracic, endoscopic&#xD;
      or surgical. When compared to surgery, the endoscopic methods have the advantages of being&#xD;
      easily accessible, cheap, safe with a very low risk of complications, and have limited&#xD;
      patient discomfort following the procedure. The major drawback is the diagnostic yield still&#xD;
      being significantly lower than surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, two methods have been developed which seem to improve the diagnostic yield&#xD;
      of bronchoscopy for diagnosing peripheral lung lesions. The rationale behind both techniques&#xD;
      is to improve identification of the lung lesions prior to performing the biopsies and thereby&#xD;
      improving the chance of obtaining representative tissue samples. One method involves the use&#xD;
      of a radial ultrasound probe inserted in the working channel of the bronchoscope, which&#xD;
      enables the proceduralist to perform radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS) to more&#xD;
      accurately identify the lung lesions before sampling them. The other method involves the use&#xD;
      of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) to guide the operator to the lung lesion.&#xD;
      One small randomised clinical trial has indicated that the diagnostic yield can be further&#xD;
      improved by a multimodal approach, which combines both rEBUS and ENB in the same procedure.&#xD;
      The drawbacks of such a combination are however increased costs and procedure time, thus&#xD;
      limiting the number of procedures which can be performed within a given time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This PhD thesis aims to determine whether a combination of rEBUS and ENB is superior to ENB&#xD;
      alone in patients with suspected lung cancer due to a peripheral lung lesion as well as an&#xD;
      estimate of the hospital costs of the entire diagnostic work up for lung cancer when&#xD;
      combining ENB and rEBUS as compared to ENB alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The diagnostic yield of ENB in combination with rEBUS is equal to ENB alone in patients&#xD;
           with peripheral lung lesions or solitary lung nodules (null hypothesis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The hospital costs of the entire diagnostic work up for lung cancer when combining ENB&#xD;
           and rEBUS is the same when compared to an approach with ENB alone (null hypothesis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the diagnostic yield of ENB in combination with rEBUS different from ENB alone in&#xD;
           diagnosing lung lesions?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the hospital costs of the entire diagnostic workup for lung cancer when&#xD;
           combining ENB and rEBUS in comparing with ENB alone?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navigation EndoBronchial ULtrAsound (NEBULA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses The study examines the following null-hypothesis: The diagnostic yield of ENB in&#xD;
      combination with rEBUS is not superior to ENB alone in patients with peripheral lung lesions&#xD;
      or solitary lung nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To determine which bronchoscopy approach should be considered standard for&#xD;
      examining patients with suspected lung cancer due to a peripheral lung lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design Multicentre, randomized, non-blinded clinical trial Pre- and&#xD;
      post-procedure Preparations prior and following the bronchoscopy procedure are done in&#xD;
      accordance with local guidelines. Procedures will be performed either under conscious&#xD;
      sedation using midazolam and fentanyl or in general anesthetic depending on the set up of the&#xD;
      center performing the procedures. Other medication given during the procedure is also given&#xD;
      accordance with local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference test Histology or cytology results will be used as the reference test for all&#xD;
      malignant as well as non-malignant conditions that could be diagnosed based on these.&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up including imaging for at least 6 months with no signs of malignancy and&#xD;
      results of additional diagnostic procedures will be used as the reference test in patients in&#xD;
      which a final diagnosis cannot be established based on histology or cytology results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistics In a previous study by Eberhardt et al. the diagnostic yield of&#xD;
      ENB and combined rEBUS/ENB was 59 % and 88 %, respectively. The diagnostic yield of the&#xD;
      intervention arm in the planned study may be lower due to selection of patients with smaller&#xD;
      lesions and multicentre approach rather than a single centre study performed by experts. If&#xD;
      the total diagnostic yield is 60 % in the control group (ENB) and 80 % in the intervention&#xD;
      group (rEBUS/ENB), then a power of 80 % at the 5 % level is obtained with a sample size of&#xD;
      184 patients. Allowing for a 10 % dropout it is planned to enroll 200 patients in the study.&#xD;
      The χ2 test, alternatively the Fischer exact test will be used to establish whether there is&#xD;
      a difference in the primary endpoint. All results will be assessed using intention to treat&#xD;
      principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies and analyses will be conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and Data Protection Agency in Denmark and the Medical Ethics Committee.:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies do not interfere with choice of other diagnostic tests performed in the patients&#xD;
      (e.g. EBUS / EUS-b for mediastinal staging). The patients are treated and followed up&#xD;
      according to national and institutional guidelines. The protocols for studies II and III do&#xD;
      not influence treatment or follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will help to clarify how one of the most important diagnostic procedures for&#xD;
      patients with suspected lung cancer due to a peripheral lung lesion should be used in&#xD;
      clinical practice. The results of the project can be directly implemented at a national scale&#xD;
      once the results are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project expenses are expected to be partially covered by funds from the Kræftens Bekæmpelse -&#xD;
      Centre for Lung Cancer Research with a grant of 1 mill. DKK. Funding of expenses for&#xD;
      procedures (e.g. scans and invasive procedures) will be covered as part of the lung cancer&#xD;
      diagnostic work up &quot;package&quot; covered by the department.&#xD;
