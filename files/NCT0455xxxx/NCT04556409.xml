    <textblock>
      Cesarean section is one of the commonly performed surgical procedures in obstetrics and is&#xD;
      certainly one of the oldest operations in surgery. One of the most dramatic features of&#xD;
      modern obstetrics is the increase in the caesarean section rate. In Egypt, the past decade&#xD;
      has witnessed a sharp increase in the prevalence of CS with the most recent Egypt Demographic&#xD;
      and Health Survey (EDHS) documenting a CS rate of 52%, which suggests that caesarean delivery&#xD;
      might be overused or used for inappropriate indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several CS skin incision and abdominal wall opening techniques have been developed during the&#xD;
      years, yet a general consensus on the most appropriate approach, in terms of safety and&#xD;
      morbidity has not been yet reached 3.The choice of technique depends largely on the Surgeon's&#xD;
      experience and preference and on the maternal-fetal clinical condition .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pfannenstiel incision and the Misgav-Ladach method, mainly represented by the modified&#xD;
      Joel-Cohen incision, are the most common skin incisions performed . The Pfannenstiel incision&#xD;
      is a transverse &quot;smile&quot;-like incision made 2-3 cm above the symphysis pubis at the pubic area&#xD;
      border; the Misgav-Ladach method is a straight transverse skin incision which lies about 3 cm&#xD;
      below the level of the anterior superior iliac spines (ASIS) . Both techniques involve skin&#xD;
      and subcutaneous tissues . Although several studies comparing these two abdominal wall&#xD;
      opening techniques have been conducted, differences in terms of acute and chronic&#xD;
      post-operative pain have not been always considered .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute and chronic pain after CS depends mainly on the type of cutaneous incision and&#xD;
      subsequent access into the pelvic cavity, in relation to the abdominal wall's somatic&#xD;
      innervation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both techniques involve an abdominal area innervated by two principal nerves:&#xD;
      ileo-hypogastric and ileo-inguinal. These nerves originate from the lumbar plexus, which is&#xD;
      formed by the ventral branches of the first to the fourth lumbar nerves (L1-L4) and by the&#xD;
      last thoracic nerve (T12) supplementing with a twig .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iliohypogastric nerve is formed by the fusion of the first lumbar branch with fibers&#xD;
      originating from T12. It arises from the upper part of the lateral border of the psoas major&#xD;
      then courses infra-laterally atop the quadratus lumborum to the ilium crest where it pierces&#xD;
      the transverse abdominal muscle and emerges approximately 3 cm medial to the ASIS. The&#xD;
      proximal end of the iliohypogastric nerve enters the abdominal wall 2.8±1.3 cm medial to and&#xD;
      1.4±1.2 cm inferior to the ASIS. Once in the abdominal wall, it follows a linear path&#xD;
      terminating 4±1.3 cm lateral to the midline . As the iliohypogastric passes through the&#xD;
      abdominal oblique muscles, it divides into the lateral and anterior cutaneous branches which&#xD;
      provide sensory innervation to the gluteal (lateral cutaneous branch) and the hypogastric&#xD;
      skin regions (anterior cutaneous branch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the treatment of peripheral nerve injury, low energy biostimulation lasers are used,&#xD;
      applied in the way of pulsatile (905 nm), continuous (808 nm), or pulsing-constant rays.&#xD;
      Laser therapy increases the formation of ATP, and the energy of the ATP hydrolysis can be&#xD;
      used by nerve cell to restore normal transmembrane potential, which facilitates the&#xD;
      generation of electrical impulses and thereby restoring nerve conduction (bioelectric&#xD;
      effect). Application of laser beams improves microcirculation and hence nutrition and&#xD;
      regeneration of nerve cells - bio-stimulation effect - and increases the release of&#xD;
      endorphins and the concentration of neurotransmitters in the synapses - analgetic effect.&#xD;
      Application of laser irradiation (Ga-As laser) in the site of the anastomosis inhibits the&#xD;
      degeneration process, accelerate remyelination, and nerve function recovery . In the clinic,&#xD;
      low-level laser therapy employs doses from 1 to 4J/cm2, associated with output power between&#xD;
      10 to 90mW, and is widely used in various musculoskeletal lesions, as well as in painful and&#xD;
      inflammatory processes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a precious study had done by Lowdon and Colleagues 30,they found that continous ultrasound&#xD;
      at low intensity (0.5W/cm2, 1MHZ, 1min. day every day for 2-3 weeks) was beneficial for&#xD;
      regeneration of tibial nerve of rats following compression lesion while continous ultrasound&#xD;
      at high intensity (1W/cm2, 1MHZ, 1min. day every day for 2-3 weeks) was harmful for&#xD;
      regeneration of tibial nerve of rats following compression injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continous low intensity ultrasound (CLIU) treatment can accelerate the regeneration and&#xD;
      functional recovery of neurotometic injured sciatic nerve at earlier stages after injury, the&#xD;
      upgraded expression of NGF induced by continuous low intensity ultrasound may be the primary&#xD;
      mechanism of the acceleration effects .&#xD;
