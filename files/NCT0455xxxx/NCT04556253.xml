  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter phase II clinical study. The aim is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and anti-tumor activities of AK104(a PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody) in&#xD;
      MSI-H/dMMR locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer during the&#xD;
      perioperative period.Eligible patients will receive AK104 for three cycles before surgery and&#xD;
      at most 6 months after surgery. The primary endpoint is the pathological complete response&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For cohort 1, histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced gastric&#xD;
             carcinoma(cT3-T4a, Nx, M0). For cohort 2, histologically or cytologically documented&#xD;
             locally advanced colorectal cancer(cT2-T4a, Nx, M0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Haven't received any chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function.&#xD;

             years prior to the first dose of study treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has undergone major surgery within 30 days of Study Day 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires systemic treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;

             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment NOTE: Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood&#xD;
             asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent&#xD;
             use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the&#xD;
             study;&#xD;
&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             this subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live virus vaccine within 30 days of the planned first dose of study&#xD;
             therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father a child within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the study including 120 days following the last dose of study&#xD;
