      To examine the effect of using Lumen on metabolic parameters and anthropometric variables.&#xD;
      This will be done from baseline to the end of a 12 weeks intervention in adults with&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A single arm intervention evaluation for 12 weeks (pre-post analysis) was designed for the&#xD;
      study. After initial screening of the subjects, they will be familiarized with Lumen and will&#xD;
      learn on how to take a measure. After 2 days of using Lumen device at home for acquaintance&#xD;
      and calibration, subjects will arrive to the clinic and several baseline measurements will be&#xD;
      taken, including blood samples and anthropometric variables. Then, subjects will use Lumen at&#xD;
      home and will take a Lumen measurement each day for a period of 12 weeks. Subjects will take&#xD;
      a Lumen measurement each morning at fasted state and will get a nutritional plan according to&#xD;
      their result. In addition, subjects will be guided to log in the last time they consumed a&#xD;
      meal (how long they fasted for), the duration of their sleep, and if they managed to follow&#xD;
      the previous day recommendations. Moreover, the Lumen application will encourage the subjects&#xD;
      to take more measurement throughout the day, in particular in response to food intake as well&#xD;
      as before and after workouts. Lumen coach will remotely support the subjects via Lumen's&#xD;
      mobile phone application and will provide clarifications and guidelines if needed based on&#xD;
      the Lumen metric. Finally, subjects will return to the clinic for their final assessment&#xD;
      which would include taking blood samples and anthropometric variables again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 40 subjects the most with a minimal target of 30 subjects. The number&#xD;
      of subjects was determined based on power analysis made according to a study evaluating HbA1c&#xD;
      levels in prediabetic subjects who received low-carb diet for 12 weeks.&#xD;
