      The prognosis for unresectable and metastatic biliary tract cancers (BTCs) including&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma is poor with first line gemcitabine and cisplatin offering a median&#xD;
      overall survival of 11.7 months. There is no standard second- or third-line therapy for&#xD;
      advanced BTC, and this represents an unmet medical need for novel therapies. The immune&#xD;
      system plays a critical role in the development of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and chronic&#xD;
      inflammation is a common underlying risk factor for CCA. Vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) signaling in CCA may lead to an immune suppression via inadequate tumor antigen&#xD;
      presentation and an impaired T cell-mediated immune response directed against tumor antigens.&#xD;
      Lenvatinib significantly decreased the population of immunosuppressive tumor-associated&#xD;
      macrophages and increased interferon-γ-producing cluster of differentiation 8+ (CD8+) T&#xD;
      cells. Addition of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand (PD-L1)&#xD;
      inhibitors helps reverse VEGF-mediated immune suppression, restore T cell function, and&#xD;
      promote T cell tumor infiltration. The combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab has&#xD;
      demonstrated promising activity with manageable adverse events in various solid tumor types.&#xD;

      Title: A Single Arm Phase II Study of Pembrolizumab in combination with Lenvatinib in&#xD;
      Patients with Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma after Progression on Standard Systemic Therapy&#xD;
      Study Description: The prognosis for unresectable and metastatic biliary tract cancers (BTCs)&#xD;
      including cholangiocarcinoma is poor with first line gemcitabine and cisplatin offering a&#xD;
      median overall survival of 11.7 months. There is no standard second- or third-line therapy&#xD;
      for advanced BTC, and this represents an unmet medical need for novel therapies. The immune&#xD;
      system plays a critical role in the development of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and chronic&#xD;
      inflammation is a common underlying risk factor for CCA. VEGF signaling in CCA may lead to an&#xD;
      immune suppression via inadequate tumor antigen presentation and an impaired T cell-mediated&#xD;
      immune response directed against tumor antigens. Lenvatinib significantly decreased the&#xD;
      population of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages and increased&#xD;
      interferon-γ-producing CD8+ T cells. Addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors helps reverse&#xD;
      VEGF-mediated immune suppression, restore T cell function, and promote T cell tumor&#xD;
      infiltration. The combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab has demonstrated promising&#xD;
      activity with manageable adverse events in various solid tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      lenvatinib in patients with advanced CCA who failed standard therapy in this phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) (RECIST1.1) of lenvatinib in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced CCA after progression on standard&#xD;
      systemic therapies Secondary Objective: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      lenvatinib+pembrolizumab in this population; Determine the duration of response (DOR),&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS); Determine the ORR, PFS and OS of&#xD;
      subgroups stratified by molecular signatures (tumor mutation burden, PD-L1 expression,&#xD;
      microsatellite instability (MSI) status, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) or FGFR&#xD;
      mutation/fusion status) in a pre-planned post-hoc analysis; Define molecular correlates of&#xD;
      response, including circulating biomarkers and tumor tissue biomarkers Study Population: The&#xD;
      study will enroll 40 patients who have unresectable or metastatic, histologically-confirmed&#xD;
      advanced CCA. Both male and female patients age of 18 years or older who have failed standard&#xD;
      systemic therapy for advanced CCA with measurable disease, adequate bone marrow reserve and&#xD;
      hepatic/renal function, and ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1 could be eligible to participate&#xD;
      in the study after completing the study enrollment screening tests and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: II Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: The study will be conducted&#xD;
      at Jiahui International Cancer Center, Shanghai Jiahui International Hospital, in&#xD;
      collaboration with Zhongshan Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment/Intervention: Each cycle is defined as 21 days treatment of Pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with Lenvatinib. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab 200mg IV day 1 of every 21 day-cycles; Lenvatinib 20mg PO once daily for 21-day&#xD;
      cycles Study Duration: 24-36 months Participant Duration: up to 24 months&#xD;
