    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is one of the common symptoms of women at childbearing age. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to assess the efficacy of acupuncture for female with non-cyclic chronic&#xD;
      pelvic pain. A three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) using acupuncture, sham&#xD;
      acupuncture and waiting list with a total sample of 150 will be conducted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a persistent pain in pelvis, anterior abdominal wall, lower&#xD;
      back, or buttocks lasting at least six months. According to a WHO epidemiological study, the&#xD;
      worldwide prevalence rate of CPP in childbearing age women was 2.1%-24%. At present, nearly&#xD;
      55% of the patients had unclear etiology, and there is no universally accepted diagnosis,&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment. CPP is often associated with gynecological and non gynecological&#xD;
      diseases, including endometriosis, abdominal visceral adhesion, myofascial pain and&#xD;
      dysfunction, irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. CPP&#xD;
      are also accompanied by psychological and physiological dysfunction, the most common is&#xD;
      depression and anxiety, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture may have effect on non-cyclic CPP in female, however, there is a lack of evidence&#xD;
      of effectiveness of acupuncture. A multi-center randomized three-armed controlled trial will&#xD;
      be conducted. The aim of this study is assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for&#xD;
      female patients with non-cyclic CPP.&#xD;

    <measure>The change from baseline of the Brief Pain Inventory score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6, 18 and 30</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory score uses 0-10 numeric scales for item rating with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The pain severity score is calculated from the four items about pain intensity with a range from 0 to 40. The pain interference score corresponds to the item on pain interference with a range from 0 to 70. Higher scores of the Brief Pain Inventory mean a worse outcome.</description>

Each item is rated from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;, and contributes with the same weight to the final score, ranging from 0 to 40. The pain interference score corresponds to the item on pain interference. Higher scores of the The pain severity score mean a worse outcome.</description>
