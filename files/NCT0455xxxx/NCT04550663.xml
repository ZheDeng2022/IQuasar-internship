             metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC)&#xD;
             staging system classification for B or C, for B, patients are not suitable for local&#xD;
             treatment and/or surgery, or disease progression occurs after surgery and/or local&#xD;
             treatment, or declined to surgery and/or local treatment);&#xD;

             patients have at least one measurable lesion. Target lesions located within the field&#xD;
             of previous therapeutic irradiation or within the area of local treatment&#xD;
             (interventional or ablative treatment) are considered measurable if progress is&#xD;
             confirmed;&#xD;
