      This study is a randomized, multicenter clinical study ，which is designed to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of the safety and efficacy of treatment every 6 weeks in EGFR positive&#xD;
      (Non-small-cell-cell cancer, NSCLC) with concurrent Driver gene mutations，who used EGFR-TKI&#xD;
      with or without combined chemotherapy，estimated with stable efficacy (CR, PR, and SD) .In&#xD;
      this study, subjects will be randomly assigned to the following two groups according to a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio:(A) Standard programme group, EGFR-TKI targeted therapy; (B) controlled programme&#xD;
      group, EGFR-TKI targeted therapy combined chemotherapy(pemetrexed plus carboplatin for 4&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, multicenter clinical study aimed at EGFR positive non-small-cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects with concurrent Driver gene mutations who have not previously&#xD;
      received systematic treatment. After comparing EGFR-TKI alone or EGFR-TKI combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy for 4 cycles, after the efficacy evaluation was stable (CR, PR, and SD), the&#xD;
      safety and clinical efficacy of maintenance therapy every 6 weeks were compared. The eligible&#xD;
      subjects in this study will be randomly assigned into the following two groups according to&#xD;
      the 1: 1 ratio: (A) Standard programme group, EGFR-TKI targeted therapy; (B) controlled&#xD;
      programme group, EGFR-TKI targeted therapy combined chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus carboplatin&#xD;
      for 4 cycles ) During the course of the trial treatment, if the subject develops disease (the&#xD;
      first PD), the researcher will decide whether to continue the medication according to the&#xD;
      patient's situation and communicate with the patient, as follows: After the first PD of the&#xD;
      subject, the researcher decides whether to continue the treatment with the original regimen&#xD;
      according to the disease state of the subject. At least 4 weeks later, the tumor is evaluated&#xD;
      again. If the tumor progresses again (the second PD), the subject's study treatment ends and&#xD;
      the follow-up period is entered; if there is no progress, the original regimen is continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point was descriptive analysis of progression-free survival and Objective&#xD;
      response rate.The secondary end point of this study was to compare the incidence of&#xD;
      treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events between the standard group and the controlled&#xD;
      group. Using RECIST 1.1 as the evaluation standard, the independent imaging evaluation&#xD;
      committee (IRRC) conducted the evaluation. For the first time to evaluate PD, regardless of&#xD;
      whether they continue to study treatment after progression, the date of the first PD&#xD;
      evaluated by IRRC will be used for all statistical analysis containing progress information.&#xD;
