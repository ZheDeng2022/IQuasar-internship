  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Cohort Treatment Plan is to allow access to nilotinib for eligible&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, preliminary responses of nilotinib monotherapy in adults with refractory or&#xD;
      relapsed Ph+ ALL show limited clinical benefit in this population of patients with a high&#xD;
      unmet medical need. Remissions induced by imatinib are of short duration and resistance to&#xD;
      imatinib represents a major clinical challenge. The exact benefit and role of nilotinib in&#xD;
      this leukemia remains to be determined and requires further analysis. Until further data is&#xD;
      available patients with Ph+ ALL should be treated with nilotinib through the Individual&#xD;
      Patient Program.. Studies to date indicate that nilotinib may provide clinical benefit to Ph+&#xD;
      ALL patients and may represent a novel treatment option for these patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following criteria must be fulfilled for the provision of Managed Access and will vary&#xD;
        depending on the stage of the product lifecycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An independent request should be received from the Treating Physician (in some&#xD;
             instances from Health Authorities, Institutions or Governments);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient to be treated has a serious or life threatening disease or condition, and&#xD;
             no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy is available to monitor or treat the&#xD;
             disease or condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is not eligible or able to enroll in a clinical trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is a potential patient benefit to justify the potential risk of the treatment&#xD;
             use, and the potential risk is not unreasonable in the context of the disease or&#xD;
             condition to be treated;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provision of the investigational product will not interfere with the initiation,&#xD;
             conduct or completion of a Novartis clinical trial or overall development program and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Such access provision as described above is allowed as per local laws and regulations.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Magnesium ≥ LLN or corrected to within normal limits with supplements prior to&#xD;
                  the first dose of nilotinib medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN or ≤ 5.0 x UL:N if considered due to tumor&#xD;
