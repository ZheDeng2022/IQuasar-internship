      The project objective is to test the feasibility of delivering health education and&#xD;
      self-management support to African-American patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN)&#xD;
      through a culturally-tailored smartphone application (app)-enhanced intervention within&#xD;
      federally qualified health centers.&#xD;

      The Fostering African-American Improvement in Total Health (FAITH!) Program at Mayo Clinic, a&#xD;
      community-based cardiovascular (CV) health promotion initiative for African-Americans (AAs)&#xD;
      will collaborate with the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) Cardiovascular Health Unit and&#xD;
      two federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) (NorthPoint Health &amp; Wellness Center,&#xD;
      Minneapolis, MN; Open Cities Health Center, St. Paul, MN) to integrate an innovative mobile&#xD;
      health (mHealth) intervention (FAITH! HTN App) into clinical and community settings with the&#xD;
      aim of improving blood pressure (BP) control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project objective is to test the feasibility of delivering health education and&#xD;
      self-management support to African-American patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN)&#xD;
      through a culturally-tailored smartphone application (app)-enhanced intervention within&#xD;
      federally qualified health centers. This initiative is a component of a Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention (CDC) effort to support state/local public health strategies to&#xD;
      prevent and manage cardiovascular disease (CVD) in under-resourced populations&#xD;
      disproportionately affected by CVD risk factors, such as HTN. Insights from the FAITH!&#xD;
      Community Steering Committee (CSC) will also provide guidance to ensure project&#xD;
      patient-centeredness. The investigators will incorporate strategies grounded in theoretical&#xD;
      frameworks to ensure soundness of our intervention while tailoring it to meet the preferences&#xD;
      and needs of an under-resourced population with multi-level barriers to HTN management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1:To assess app feasibility through participant intervention engagement (app&#xD;
      education module completion, self-monitoring) and intervention satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To assess preliminary efficacy of the app by evaluating improvement in&#xD;
      patient BP control (immediate, 3 months and 6 months post-intervention), CV health knowledge&#xD;
      (via app self-assessments), and BP self-management (medication adherence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that an app-based intervention will be feasible and demonstrate&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy in improving uncontrolled HTN and health education among AA patients&#xD;
      from baseline to post-intervention (immediate, 3 months and 6 months post-intervention).&#xD;

    <description>FAITH! HTN App: The program promotes HTN self-management through a 10-week education module series on HTN. Participants will follow each module weekly and use a wireless home BP monitor for self-tracking which syncs to the app. The app includes module quizzes, a BP tracking dashboard and a moderated sharing board to foster discussion on HTN management.&#xD;
Patient-Provider-CHW ICM. The patient-provider-CHW triad works together for personalized, collaborative goal setting. The patient will complete app modules, self-monitor BP, and engage with a sharing board integrating HTN topics. At weekly virtual visits (telephone or video), the CHW will record patient BPs, assist with addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) identified by the patient (eg, local community resources), and review HTN modules. The CHW will upload clinical/SDOH data to the patient electronic medical record (EMR) for FQHC care providers to review. This cycle will be completed weekly over the 10-week intervention.</description>
