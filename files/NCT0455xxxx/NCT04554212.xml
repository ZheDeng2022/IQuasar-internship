  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to allow health care professionals and researchers to answer&#xD;
      many questions about whether either an injection of saline (salt water) in the knee or a new&#xD;
      type of physical therapy called blood flow restriction training (called BFRT) will improve&#xD;
      recovery after patellar dislocation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will randomly be assigned to 1 of 4 groups. This means that neither the&#xD;
      participant or their doctor will not choose the treatment, but that the treatment will be&#xD;
      randomly selected (like a coin toss). The two study treatments are saline injection and blood&#xD;
      flow restriction training (BFRT). BFRT uses an air cuff that is inflated around the top of&#xD;
      the thigh. This temporarily limits blood flow to the muscles and may allow the participant to&#xD;
      recover strength more quickly after injury. As will be described later, the participant will&#xD;
      be closely monitored during all study treatments to make sure they are as safe as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four groups that participants could be assigned to are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Knee injection with standard physical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Injection without saline but with standard physical therapy and BFRT&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Knee injection with standard physical therapy and BFRT&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Injection without saline but with and standard physical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee Aspiration and Saline Injection: All patients will have an injection of a numbing&#xD;
      medication called lidocaine in the skin on the side of the knee. During a knee aspiration the&#xD;
      study doctor will remove fluid from the space around the knee using a needle and syringe. A&#xD;
      spray will be used to numb your skin in the area. Then the participant will have the numbing&#xD;
      injection in the skin on the side of the knee. YKnee aspirations after knee injury are a&#xD;
      common orthopaedic practice to either relieve swelling or to obtain fluid for analysis to&#xD;
      diagnose a joint disorder and/or problem. After the fluid is drawn off the knee, the study&#xD;
      doctor will inject two tablespoons of saline into the knee. There are no known side effects&#xD;
      of this treatment. There is a 50/50 chance that participants will either have only the&#xD;
      numbing medication injection or an injection of the numbing medication followed by a saline&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Therapy Sessions: We are comparing two physical therapy interventions, one is the&#xD;
      standard of care and the other is the standard of care plus an additional treatment.&#xD;
      Participants have a 50/50 chance of receiving either treatment. If randomized to receive&#xD;
      BFRT, the air cuffs will then be placed on the participants' thighs and they will be doing a&#xD;
      standardized exercise program that will vary depending on the stage of rehabilitation they&#xD;
      are in and as determined by the study personnel. Participants will also complete a&#xD;
      standardized course of physical therapy. Activities in physical therapy may include ice over&#xD;
      the knee, range of motion exercises to maintain hip strength and gait training exercises as&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures may be performed. Some procedures may not be performed due to time&#xD;
      constraints, availability of equipment, and/or by the decision of the investigator. Before&#xD;
      initiating physical therapy, participants will be asked some questions including but not&#xD;
      limited to the following: age, sex, level of activities, and expectations. Participants will&#xD;
      also complete a Sports Activity Scale to determine their physical activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline of Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 Screening and enrollment: Upon arriving at the clinic potential subjects will have&#xD;
      the following assessments: range of motion, knee instability and standardized bent knee&#xD;
      weight bearing x-rays, all of which are the standard of care for a patient with a suspected&#xD;
      patella dislocation. After providing informed consent to participate in the study,&#xD;
      investigators will ask participants to provide a urine sample and will collect about 2&#xD;
      teaspoons of blood for laboratory testing. The blood will be collected from the arm using&#xD;
      standard venipuncture. In addition, investigators will ask participants questions about their&#xD;
      medical history including current medications, demographic information, BMI, and smoking&#xD;
      status. Participants will be asked to complete three study questionnaires: the Norwich&#xD;
      Patella Instability Score which asks questions about the knee, the Cincinnati Occupational&#xD;
      Rating Scale which asks questions about the physical demands of their job or daily life, and&#xD;
      a Visual Analogue Scale that will ask participants to rate their current pain. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to either have a saline injection or no knee injection. Participants have&#xD;
      a 50/50 chance of having the injection. Investigators will also schedule you to go to the&#xD;
      BioMotion laboratory for baseline strength testing and to have the first study MRI.&#xD;
