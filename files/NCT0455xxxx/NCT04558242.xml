  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the safety and effectiveness of a light therapy&#xD;
      device for human hair growth. This device, called the GENIX, is a type of cold, or non-heat&#xD;
      producing light emitting diode (LED) that will emit light on the hair growth cells within and&#xD;
      around the hair follicle. When these cells do not function properly, one may experience&#xD;
      common problems such as baldness and thinning or brittle hair. The application of a special&#xD;
      category of low-level non-laser light to be studied in the project may cause an increase in&#xD;
      essential nutrients to the damaged hair follicles and skin cells, leading to a reduction in&#xD;
      hair loss and in some cases, possibly leading to re-growth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The application of low-level light therapy has aroused considerable research interest in&#xD;
      recent years for the treatment of a variety of clinical indications. These range from pain&#xD;
      management to wound healing and most recently to hair regrowth. All have demonstrated&#xD;
      biological effects in living organisms. In 1967 Endre Mester, a physician practicing in&#xD;
      Budapest Hungary, decided to test the effects of laser radiation on mice and its possible&#xD;
      link to resultant cancer. To his great surprise, the mice regrew the shaved hair in half the&#xD;
      time of non-radiated mice. This was the first reference to LLLT and hair growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study on LLLT, aims to confirm the established safety and physiologic effects that occur&#xD;
      when the human hair follicle and surrounding tissue structures are exposed to this type of&#xD;
      radiation. Thus far, all reports on the efficacy of low level light therapy (LED) in this&#xD;
      area, have been, in large part, consistent in outcome results, as supported by multi-center,&#xD;
      randomized, double blind, controlled studies. This has been in the form of analysis of the&#xD;
      non-radiated and radiated tissues as determined by terminal hair counts from baseline to post&#xD;
      treatment counts. The theory that is widely accepted is that the mitochondria are the&#xD;
      powerhouse of the stem cells that cause hair growth. The LLLT &quot;turns on&quot; the nutrient pump&#xD;
      process that energizes the mitochondria, which leads to an increase in ATP and subsequent&#xD;
      reversal of hair follicles from the dormant stage of growth called telogen, to the active&#xD;
      growth stage called anagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This specific light system is unclassified by the FDA, from a radiation standpoint, because&#xD;
      the agency has not developed class designations for LEDs. Currently, it is classified as a&#xD;
      class II medical device and will be designated as an Over-the-Counter device. It may be&#xD;
      marketed for hair regrowth, as defined by an increase in terminal hairs and wellness, which&#xD;
      can be defined as thicker, denser, more supple and darker hair shafts.&#xD;
