  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the early detection of prostate cancer by analysing circulating bloodbased&#xD;
      biomarkers. Based on our latest developments, we primarily aim to assess the validity of CTCs&#xD;
      (circulating tumour cells) and tumour cell products circulating in blood (DNA, exosomes) for&#xD;
      early PCa (Prostate cancer) detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first discovery period, the investigators will assess which Liquid biopsy marker will&#xD;
      provide the best discrimination between the patients with histologically proven PCa and&#xD;
      age-matched noncancer controls. Further subset analysis with special emphasis on the&#xD;
      identification of high risk PCa patients with aggressive tumours as defined by a Gleason&#xD;
      score (&quot;gold standard&quot;) of 8 or higher (ISUP 4 and higher), will be performed. The resulting&#xD;
      biomarker candidates will then be further explored in the subsequent training and validation&#xD;
      study (years 2 and 3) in order to obtain the single blood test or combination of tests with&#xD;
      the highest sensitivity and specificity for detection of early PCa and/or high-risk PCa. The&#xD;
      investigators will also compare these new biomarkers with recently FDA cleared CE-IVD assays&#xD;
      for early detection of prostate cancer, based on classic peripheral tumour markers, such as&#xD;
      Prostate Health Index (PHI) and PCA3. Follow up evaluations will be initiated to assess the&#xD;
      prognostic relevance of the candidate biomarkers determined in this project. Here, the&#xD;
      investigators will set up the data management system including all relevant information on&#xD;
      the tissues collected and the results of the analyses as well as the clinical data of the&#xD;
      patients investigated in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this preclinical validation study patients suspicious of prostate cancer who will undergo&#xD;
      initial prostate biopsy are going to be asked for blood samples during a routine visit. Each&#xD;
      patient will have had an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) as part of the care before&#xD;
      performing the biopsy. The investigators will draw a total of 49 ml peripheral blood from&#xD;
      consented patients before the initial diagnostic biopsy is taken. Within this project,&#xD;
      validation of liquid biopsy assays for early detection of prostate cancer patients is the&#xD;
      primary goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine CTC numbers, 21 ml of blood will be subjected to either CTC-Capture,&#xD;
      and 28 ml for the EPIDROP analysis according to standard protocol (For analysis of&#xD;
      circulating blood products plasma, analysis of tumor specific mutations or promotor&#xD;
      methylation, analysis of extracellular vesicles and microRNA). The investigators will also&#xD;
      analyze the Prostate Health Index marker from the additional EDTA tube (7 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess whether CTC counts and/or detection of tumor specific blood&#xD;
      products will provide discrimination between the men with histologically proven prostate&#xD;
      cancer and agematched non-cancer controls as well as identification of high-risk PCa&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will compare results from tested liquid biopsy assay with&#xD;
      current standard of early prostate cancer detection using both serum PSA and digital rectal&#xD;
      examination, MRImp and PSA density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discovery phase is a non-blind study on 70 subjects with elevated PSA, and 50 negative&#xD;
      controls (Healthy patients no suspicion of prostate cancer; PSA&lt;2.5). The 70 patients are&#xD;
      patients with suspected prostate cancer and will undergo prostate biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will be tested for the 3 biomarkers (CTCs, cfDNA, exosome). The validation study&#xD;
      is a non-blind study on 167 subjects with elevated PSA and designated for a biopsy (this&#xD;
      biopsy may be positive (presence of cancer) or negative (no cancer revealed by the biopsy)),&#xD;
      and 33 negative controls. The samples will be tested with the best biomarkers or biomarker&#xD;
      combination selected in the discovery phase.&#xD;
