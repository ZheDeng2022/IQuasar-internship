  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether acute stress can precipitate congestive&#xD;
      heart failure (CHF) exacerbation in patients with CHF.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo a laboratory mental stress protocol, and a field protocol using&#xD;
      ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to, 1) test the effects of psychological stress and&#xD;
      negative emotion on pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in HF patients; 2) examine the&#xD;
      relationship of stress-induced PAP change to HF exacerbation; and 3) identify a risk profile&#xD;
      by exploring predictors of heterogeneity in the PAP response to stress, including&#xD;
      physiological variables (e.g., NYHA class, biomarkers), sleep, quality, and psychosocial&#xD;
      variables (e.g., sources of chronic stress, anger/hostility, depression. Patients will also&#xD;
      undergo a battery of psychosocial questionnaires either online or paper as they prefer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Component HF patients with existing or newly implanted with a CardioMEMS PAP&#xD;
      monitor will complete the laboratory stress protocol, in the Hospital Research Unit (HRU) or&#xD;
      other YCCI outpatient sites. Resting Baseline (10min). Stress period (10min) Recovery (30min)&#xD;
      follows the stress task. PAP and blood pressure are assessed, and the participant completes a&#xD;
      stress/mood likert assessment at 15min and 30min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood drawing: 10 ml of blood will be drawn for a panel of CHF-related biomarkers either at&#xD;
      the beginning of the laboratory session or in a clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field Component: For this phase, they will complete PAP assessment in the morning for six&#xD;
      months, following their standard clinical protocol for daily monitoring (standard of care).&#xD;
      In addition, at the time of the morning PAP assessment they will complete eDiary-based EMA&#xD;
      via likert style questions (e.g., on an anchored, 1-10 scale) concerning the quality of their&#xD;
      sleep the night before, the level of stress they are currently experiencing, and their&#xD;
      emotional state. For one month, they will complete an additional evening PAP assessment,&#xD;
      (extra, not standard of care) at which time they will complete similar eDiary-based likert&#xD;
      style questions concerning the stressfulness of their day and the sources of stress (if any)&#xD;
      they have experienced. All questions will be completed using the smartphone based EMA 'app'&#xD;
      that the team has used and are currently using in NIH funded studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up - Clinical outcomes will be determined through review of the Cardiomems Merlin&#xD;
      database and medical record review &amp; Baseline psychosocial questionnaires&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Heart failure patients over 18 who have or will be receiving a Cardiomems implanted PAP&#xD;
        monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are unable to perform EMA or laboratory assessments due to cognitive, visual,&#xD;
        language, or other disabilities will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Class IV heart failure will also be excluded, as they are already maximally&#xD;
        decompensated, and a ceiling/floor effect would preclude effects of stress.&#xD;
