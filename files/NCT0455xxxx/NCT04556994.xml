  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. CAD happens when the&#xD;
      arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the&#xD;
      buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup&#xD;
      is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the arteries. As a&#xD;
      result, the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain&#xD;
      (angina) or a heart attack. Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the&#xD;
      hearts' blood supply, causing permanent heart damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies reported positive effects of early exercise in the ICU on these measures .&#xD;
      In a meta-analysis published earlier, early mobilization increased the number of&#xD;
      ventilator-free days during hospitalization, but not the duration of Minute ventilation (MV).&#xD;
      A possible explanation is that many patients without MV were included . As a result, these&#xD;
      results should be interpreted with caution. The mortality rate is a traditional measure of&#xD;
      the health status of critically ill patients. Muscle weakness is associated with increased&#xD;
      mortality. Physical therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU) had no effect on mortality in&#xD;
      many previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Similar to previous studies, early&#xD;
      mobilization did not improve ICU mortality, hospital mortality, or 28-day mortality rates in&#xD;
      the previously published meta-analysis. The discharged-to-home rate is an important&#xD;
      prognostic indicator for critically ill patients, first showed that early mobilization&#xD;
      increased the discharged-to-home rate compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous study it was concluded that, after the performance of the mobilization protocol,&#xD;
      the patients in the Immunoglobulins (IG) improved the distance walked in the 6 min walk test&#xD;
      (6MWT), which was assessed during 7 postoperative days and 60 days after hospital discharge,&#xD;
      and it was less time in ICU and lower prevalence of pulmonary complications, when compared to&#xD;
      the control group (CG). It was also concluded that with the results obtained from their&#xD;
      study, it was possible to introduce an early mobilization protocol in the ICU routinely unit&#xD;
      and sensitize the medical board about the importance of proper physiotherapy conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another previously conducted study states that regardless of the different techniques and&#xD;
      periods of mobilization applied, early mobilization may be initiated safely in the ICU&#xD;
      setting and appears to decrease the incidence of Intensive care unit-acquired weakness&#xD;
      (ICU-AW), improve the functional capacity, and increase the number of patients who are able&#xD;
      to stand, number of ventilator-free days and discharged-to-home rate without increasing the&#xD;
      rate of adverse events. However, due to the substantial heterogeneity among the included&#xD;
      studies, the evidence has a low quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous study states the importance of this approach; this has been emphasized in previous&#xD;
      studies on experienced paddlers, rowers, cross-country skiers, cyclists and runners. However,&#xD;
      some studies in sports that depend upon a high lower extremity documented a dependence of&#xD;
      results from a specific Paddler on the season when the test was undertaken. During paddling,&#xD;
      ventilatory functions are also very important. Values for the maximal minute ventilation&#xD;
      (Vmax) and tidal volume obtained in the cycle ergometer were higher than in paddling in&#xD;
      previous studies. During endurance performance the tidal volume depends on age, sex and&#xD;
      constitutional factors and, in athletes, mainly on the nature and duration.The Max oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2) differences between maximal cycling and paddling were non-significant in&#xD;
      previous studies. The ventilation equivalent affords insight into the economy of respiration.&#xD;
      The magnitude is dependent on constitutional factors, especially on morphological conditions&#xD;
      of the respiratory system, and partly on sex, age and, especially in athletes, on the economy&#xD;
      of ventilation.&#xD;

    <measure>Functional independence</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an 18-item measurement tool that explores an individual's physical, psychological and social function. The tool is used to assess a patient's level of disability as well as change in patient status in response to rehabilitation or medical intervention.&#xD;
The higher the score is for a task, the more independent a person is at performing the task. For example, a score of 1 indicates that a person needs total assistance with a task, while a score of 7 means a person can perform a task with complete independence.</description>

    <measure>Self-efficacy Formative Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Efficacy Formative Questionnaire was developed in 2015 by Research Collaboration. An extensive review of related research resulted in identifying the two components essential for developing self-efficacy. Positive self-efficacy increased when students both believe that ability can grow with effort, as well as believed in their abilities to meet specific goals. The questionnaire was tested for reliability using Cronbach's coefficient alpha2&#xD;
Results are displayed on a 100-point scale. These scores can be interpreted similar to grades (e.g., 70-79 is a C)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Arterial blood gases (Ph)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>An arterial blood gas (ABG) test measures the acidity (pH) and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood from an artery. This test is used to check how well your lungs are able to move oxygen into the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the blood.&#xD;
Normal blood pH ranges from 7.35 to 7.45 this is slightly to the alkaline side of the scale. If the pH is at the low end of the scale or if it is actually below 7.35, the condition is acidemia. Thus if it above 7.45 it is described as alkalemia.</description>

    <measure>Ejection fraction</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Echocardiography is a test that uses sound waves to produce live images of your heart. The image is an echocardiogram. This test allows your doctor to monitor how your heart and its valves are functioning. Ejection fraction is a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving your heart each time it contracts. The heart contracts and relaxes.&#xD;
A normal heart's ejection fraction may be between 50 and 70 percent. A ejection fraction measurement under 40 percent may be evidence of heart failure or cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
EF from 41 to 49 percent may be considered &quot;borderline.&quot; It does not always indicate that a person is developing heart failure. Instead, it may indicate damage, perhaps from a previous heart attack.&#xD;
An ejection fraction measurement higher than 75 percent may indicate a heart condition such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life SF-36 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) questionnaire consists of eight scales yielding two summary measures: physical and mental health. The physical health measure includes four scales of physical functioning (10 items), role-physical (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), and general health (5 items). The mental health measure is composed of vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role-emotional (3 items), and mental health (5 items). A final item, termed self-reported health transition, is answered by the client but is not included in the scoring process.&#xD;
The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
