  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 habitual soft contact lens wearing participants will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      unilateral, randomized, double-masked (participant and investigator masked) repeated measures&#xD;
      insertion study. All participants will be seen for a Screening/Dispensing Visit at which&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained and eligibility will be assessed. If participants satisfy&#xD;
      all eligibility criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, subjects will insert study&#xD;
      lenses in random, successive order according to unique randomization schedules that will be&#xD;
      provided to each Investigator.&#xD;

          <description>Participants wore each lens type for 5, 10 and 15 minutes in a randomly assigned fashion. All participants completed the study, therefore each participant wore kalifilcon A lens, Dailies Total 1, Precision 1, and Biotrue ONEday. The only way to show demography for each lens is to show the same information for 10 participants that completed kalifilcon A lens wear, the 10 participants that completed Dailies Total 1 wear, the 10 participants that completed Precision 1 wear, and the 10 participants that completed Biotrue ONEday wear, but there are 10 participants total, not the 40 that the demography table would show if the duplicate information is entered for each lens to which a participant was exposed.</description>

        <title>Surface Refractive Index Shifts at 10 Minutes</title>
        <description>Refractive index is the ratio of velocity of light in a material divided with velocity of light in vacuum. The eye was measured for surface refractive index on the refractometer. The refractive index of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in the medium. It has no units.</description>
        <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
        <population>Participants wore each lens type for 5, 10 and 15 minutes in a randomly assigned fashion. The surface refractive index was measured at each timepoint. All participants completed the study. All 10 participants completed kalifilcon A lens wear, all 10 participants completing Dailies Total 1 wear, all 10 participants completed Precision 1 wear, and all 10 participants completed Biotrue ONEday wear. There were 10 participants total who wore each lens type for 5, 10 and 15 minutes each.</population>
