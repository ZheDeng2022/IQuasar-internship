  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain has two sides. The 'bad pain' refers to the adverse impact of pain on humans, which&#xD;
      disturbs daily life of the sufferers. Evidence indicates that in the transduction and&#xD;
      transmission of the painful signals some molecules may retrogradely moving to the tissues&#xD;
      where the pain was initiated, to provide protection to the cells and the organ being insulted&#xD;
      by the nociceptive stimulation. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), as a&#xD;
      nociceptor, promotes the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P&#xD;
      (SP) in the small diameter primary sensory neurons, mediating the pain signals from&#xD;
      nociceptor to the spinal dorsal horn, sending the pain signals to the central nervous system.&#xD;
      In the same time, the neuropeptides are released from the peripheral nerve terminals of the&#xD;
      innervating neurons, where the harmful stimulation occurred, including the heart and&#xD;
      vasculature. CGRP and SP play important roles in cardio-protection and homeostasis of&#xD;
      systemic hemodynamics via the neurogenic mechanism. All the beneficial effects initiated by&#xD;
      pain is mentioned as 'good pain' by physiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery-related pain is mostly so severe and disturbing that must be medically treated.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the beneficial aspect of pain is commonly ignored in daily clinical practice.&#xD;
      Does it matter to the patients' outcomes? We don't know yet! What we have been seeing is the&#xD;
      shocking outcomes of patients underwent surgery, which shows about 0.8% and 7% of mortalities&#xD;
      in the period of 48 hours and 30 days after surgery, respectively&#xD;
      (https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/national-hip-fracture-database-annual-report-20&#xD;
      16; Injury. 2017; 48(10): 2180-2183). What causes the disaster? Piles of evidence demonstrate&#xD;
      that deep anesthesia or deep sedation is related to the high mortality of the patients&#xD;
      (Anesthesiology. 2012; 116:1195-1203; Crit Care. 2014; 18(4):R156 ). What about the effect of&#xD;
      analgesia, especially the over-analgesia, on the patients' outcome in and after surgery?&#xD;
      Opioids are the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of moderate and sever pain&#xD;
      including intra- and postoperative pain. The µ-opioid receptor agonists induce analgesic&#xD;
      effect via inhibition of the transduction and the transmission of pain signals, by&#xD;
      suppression of the release of CGRP and SP from the nerve terminals. The protective effects on&#xD;
      cardiovascular system mediated by CGRP and SP can be inhibited, if the same effect is&#xD;
      produced by the action of opioids in the peripheral nerve terminals innervating the heart and&#xD;
      the vasculature. Our previous research shows that intrathecal administration of morphine or&#xD;
      epidural administration of ropivacaine (1%, in 20 μL) significantly attenuates the increases&#xD;
      of CGRP and its coding mRNA in ventricular myocardium and the innervating dorsal root&#xD;
      ganglion neurons following occlusion of coronary artery in experimental animals. Based on the&#xD;
      evidence, we hypothesize that over-analgesia using opioids significantly suppresses the&#xD;
      activity of TRPV1/CGRP、SP mechanism and reduces the amount of CGRP and SP released, which&#xD;
      results in an effective de-protection of the cardiovascular system. The severer myocardial&#xD;
      damage under some insulting circumstances and eventful systemic hemodynamics is likely&#xD;
      occurring upon some surgical/pathological/pharmacological insults in the intra- and&#xD;
      postoperative periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This parallel, randomized controlled trial will be conducted in eleven centers in Shanxi&#xD;
      province, China, which is designed to investigate the perioperative incidence of adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and alteration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in the patients (one&#xD;
      thousand patients, ASA Physical Status 1-II, older than 16 years, regardless of the gender)&#xD;
      undergoing surgery under total intravenous general anesthesia with conventional µ-opioid&#xD;
      agonists or Esketamine, as the major analgesic. Clinically appropriate anesthesia depth or&#xD;
      BIS readings will be used for judgement of anesthetic depth. Conventional monitoring&#xD;
      parameters, including blood pressures, heart rate, SpO2 and ECG, will be recorded and&#xD;
      analyzed. Blood samples will be collected at 30 min before induction of anesthesia, at the&#xD;
      end of surgery and 24 h after the surgery. The association of the perioperative adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and the alterations of the levels of serum TRPV1, CGRP, SP and cTnI in&#xD;
      the patients underwent general anesthesia using different analgesics (µ-opioid agonists vs&#xD;
      Esketamine) will be evaluated. Postoperative outcome, including the functions of the brain&#xD;
      and cardiovascular system, is also going to be traced for 1 year postoperatively.&#xD;
