  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a novel robot-guided stretching under intelligent control&#xD;
      and combine it with active movement training, which helped increase joint ROM, reduce&#xD;
      spasticity and joint stiffness, increase muscle force output, and improve locomotion.&#xD;
      However, for stroke survivors with sensorimotor impairment, their peripheral muscle may not&#xD;
      sufficiently be recruited. Functional electrical stimulation (FES), has been shown its&#xD;
      advantage to activate the peripheral muscles for people with neurological conditions. The&#xD;
      investigators thus make a hybrid robot-FES rehabilitation system, combining the advantage of&#xD;
      robot and FES technologies for stroke motor recovery. The investigators further would like to&#xD;
      translate the technologies from lab to home-based training. Thus, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a randomized, controlled, primarily home-based clinical trial using an ankle robot&#xD;
      alone or combined with functional electrical stimulation (FES) to treat sensorimotor and&#xD;
      locomotion impairments post-stroke.&#xD;
