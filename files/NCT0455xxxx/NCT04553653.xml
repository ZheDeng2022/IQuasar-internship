      The investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a checklist in acute severe&#xD;
      hypertension would result in improving short and long-term outcomes of patients with acute&#xD;
      severe hypertension treated in the emergency department (ED). The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that in the short-term, a checklist would improve the diagnosis and management of end-organ&#xD;
      damage as well as reduce the length of stay of acute severe hypertensive patients in the ED.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the checklist will result in better compliance with&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive medications than without the checklist at six-month post-discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a global public health issue and results in over 10 million deaths every&#xD;
      year. The disease affects one-third of people living in low- and middle-income countries&#xD;
      (LMICs) and contributes to half of all productivity losses in LMICs due to non-communicable&#xD;
      diseases. Though hypertension often presents as a chronic asymptomatic illness,&#xD;
      hypertension-related emergencies represent a significant burden to the health care system.&#xD;
      Acute severe hypertension [i.e., systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 180 mmHg or diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mmHg] make up to 5% of all emergency admission. One-third of these&#xD;
      patients present with end-organ damage; a condition called a hypertensive crisis. More&#xD;
      worrisome is the fact that a number of ED visits, as a result, severe acute hypertension and&#xD;
      hypertensive crises have almost tripled between 2006 and 2013 in the US. Treatment approaches&#xD;
      to managing acute severe hypertension (~5% of ED patients) are largely unclear and only 6% of&#xD;
      ED patients with acute severe hypertension receive appropriate work-up for the end-organ&#xD;
      damage, indicating a huge care gap. One approach, which has been used successfully in&#xD;
      managing other complex and critical conditions, is the use of checklists. Checklists are a&#xD;
      listing of actions to be performed in a given clinical setting with the aim of improving&#xD;
      adherence to standards, reducing errors and thus improving patient outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the use of a Checklist, if appropriately implemented, can lead&#xD;
      to an improvement in the care of patients presenting with hypertensive crisis. During this&#xD;
      study, the investigators will measure the prevalence of acute severe hypertension and assess&#xD;
      the current quality of care for these patients. This will be followed by the development of a&#xD;
      checklist for the management of the hypertensive crises in the ED. The investigators will&#xD;
      follow these patients to see the impact of the checklist on the quality of care and long-term&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
