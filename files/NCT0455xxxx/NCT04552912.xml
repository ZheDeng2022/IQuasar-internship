      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of an evidence-based tailored physical&#xD;
      activity program adapted for adults with acute leukemia. Implementation-related process&#xD;
      evaluation of the physical activity program will also be assessed.&#xD;

      Rationale/Significance of Study: Acute leukemias (AL) are an aggressive and often&#xD;
      debilitating cancer with increasing incidence among those with a prior history of cancer and&#xD;
      older adults. Initial treatment is complex and even when remission is initially achieved,&#xD;
      there is a high risk for disease relapse. Research shows that individual characteristics such&#xD;
      as decreased physical function are associated with poor survival in AL. Intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy remains the standard treatment necessary for survival. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      administration entails extended hospitalization for treatment and to monitor and manage&#xD;
      multiple symptoms, life-threatening complications, and other adverse events which often&#xD;
      necessitate intensive care unit admissions. Given the significance of this illness and its&#xD;
      complications, adults with AL are commonly encouraged to rest during induction treatment.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the long periods of hospitalization and rest result in diminished physical&#xD;
      function during and after treatment. In fact, patients are unable to function at pre-cancer&#xD;
      levels which can delay or prevent future intensive treatments, such as hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant, that are most likely to be life-saving. Currently there are no clinical&#xD;
      interventions specific to assisting adults recovering from intense induction treatment.&#xD;
      However, PA programs have been shown to improve physical function and reduce symptoms in many&#xD;
      other clinical/disease contexts. Specifically, the Otago home-based program, has undergone&#xD;
      extensive testing internationally and has demonstrated effectiveness for improving strength,&#xD;
      mobility, balance and preventing falls in vulnerable older adults. Efforts to assess the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of evidence-based PA programs for adults recovering from induction&#xD;
      treatment for AL are critically needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptual/Theoretical Framework: The evaluation approach for this study is guided by the&#xD;
      RE-AIM (reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, maintenance) evaluation framework. The&#xD;
      tailored PA intervention is guided by the information-motivation-behavioral (IMB) change&#xD;
      theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Research Variable(s): Reach: percent of eligible patients enrolled; Efficacy: physical&#xD;
      function assessments; Adoption: qualitative interviews to understand what is needed to adopt&#xD;
      the intervention into practice; Implementation: intervention fidelity/adherence; Maintenance:&#xD;
      qualitative interviews to understand what is needed to sustain the intervention in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a two-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) with an implementation-related&#xD;
      process evaluation of the tailored PA intervention. Participants will be randomized to either&#xD;
      the nurse-led PA intervention or the attention-control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center Sample: Adults diagnosed with AL&#xD;
      receiving consolidation/maintenance chemotherapy Methods: A longitudinal RCT over 3-months to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of our nurse-led tailored home-based PA program versus&#xD;
      attention-control. Participants will complete physical function tests and questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline, 6-weeks and 3-months. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected for&#xD;
      summative and formative data relevant to the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance&#xD;
      domains of RE-AIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications for Practice: Adults with AL experience decreased physical function and&#xD;
      concurrent symptoms that negatively affects quality of life (QOL) and may increase their risk&#xD;
      for further adverse events. This intervention would provide oncology nurses with tools to&#xD;
      support patients to engage in behaviors that improve their QOL.&#xD;

    <description>The Build StaMINA (Biobehavioral Self-Management INtervention using physical Activity) is a tailored evidence-based physical activity (PA) program designed to improve endurance, strength, and balance which are all areas of physical function, that adults with acute leukemia (AL) post-induction are known to have diminished capacity. The Build StaMINA program will be tailored to their current Physical Function, per assessment. The detailed PA prescription includes each exercise in the program as well as the frequency, number of repetitions each day and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) for each exercise. The repetitions and RPE are based on the participants' current Physical Function Assessment and will be assigned based on our evidence-based algorithm.</description>
