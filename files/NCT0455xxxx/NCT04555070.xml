      A) Study design and setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Design: An observational Cross-sectional Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Setting and Location: Being a retrospective study, CBCT scans of Egyptian patients who&#xD;
           have already been subjected to CBCT examination as part of their dental diagnosis and/or&#xD;
           treatment planning will be included. The CBCT scans will be obtained from the data base&#xD;
           available at the department of Oral and Maxillo-facial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry,&#xD;
           Cairo University, and a private Oral Radiology center, Cairo, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on sample size calculation, a sample of 272 canals of mandibular first and second&#xD;
      permanent molars belonging to Egyptian individuals will be examined. The selection of the&#xD;
      scans to be included will be based on the following eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Details about variable&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Mesio-distal direction of root canal curvatures in the sagittal cuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Bucco-lingual direction of root canal curvatures in the coronal cuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Schneider's angle of root canals curvatures present in both coronal and sagittal&#xD;
                cuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
                D) Data Sources / Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Retrospective Data Analysis will be performed after the CBCT images are pooled&#xD;
                     from the computer database.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Exposure parameters of the scans were varied depending on the individual&#xD;
                     patient's sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  CBCT scans showing mandibular first and second permanent molars with maximum&#xD;
                     0.2 voxel sizes will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  CBCT images will be analysed using Planmeca Romexis Viewer software, CBCT&#xD;
                     images will be analyzed in 2 planes; the root canal curvatures in the&#xD;
                     mesio-distal dimension from the sagittal section and the curvatures in the&#xD;
                     bucco-lingual dimension from the coronal sections, determining the direction&#xD;
                     of root canal curvatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  For each image of canal trajectory, the number of curvatures and their angle&#xD;
                     will be recorded using Schneider's criteria (Schneider 1971) as follows; (5&#xD;
                     degrees or less); as straight canal (10 to 20 degrees); as moderate curvature&#xD;
                     (25 to 70 degrees); as severe curvature&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If the trajectory of the canal contained more than one curve, the additional&#xD;
                     curvatures were measured as described by Cunningham &amp; Senia (1992) who&#xD;
                     measured Schneider's angle for each curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  All CBCT scans will be interpreted by the main investigator, and 30% of the&#xD;
                     scans will be re-viewed by the same radiologist to assess intra-observer&#xD;
                     reliability with at least 2 weeks interval and by another experienced&#xD;
                     radiologist (co-supervisor) to assess inter-observer reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
                E) Addressing potential sources of bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
                No source of bias. CBCT scans will be coded and interpreted by two oral and&#xD;
                maxillofacial radiologists blinded from demographic data of the patients and from&#xD;
                the results of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
                F) Study Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
                This power analysis used percentage of curved canals at the cervical third in&#xD;
                sagittal plane as the primary outcome. Based upon the results of Estrela C et al&#xD;
                (2015), the percentage was 77%. Using alpha (α) level of (5%), acceptable margin of&#xD;
                error = 5%; the minimum estimated sample size was 272 canals. Sample size&#xD;
                calculation was performed using Epi Info 7.2.2.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
                G) Sampling strategy: The sample will be collected by simple random sampling. H)&#xD;
                Quantitative variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handling of quantitative variables in analyses The number of root canals of permanent&#xD;
           mandibular first and second molars of Egyptian individuals with root canal curvatures&#xD;
           will be counted to estimate the variations in the Egyptian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of curvatures will be estimated using Schneider's method. The direction of&#xD;
      curvatures will be detected from sagittal and coronal cuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Statistical methods. Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS advanced statistics (Statistical&#xD;
      Package for Social Scienceaszxs), version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Numerical data will be&#xD;
      described as mean and standard deviation or median and range. Categorical data will be&#xD;
      described as numbers and percentages. A p-value less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant. All tests will be two tailed.&#xD;
