      As biologic, epidemiologic, and clinical trial data have demonstrated, inflammation is a key&#xD;
      driver of atherosclerosis. Recently, a gigantic proof-of-concept trial, CANTOS has&#xD;
      demonstrated that inflammation of atherosclerosis can be effectively modulated by&#xD;
      Canakinumab. However, fatal infections encountered and high cost in CANTOS. There is,&#xD;
      therefore, a clear need for cheaper and safe alternatives. The latest cell biological studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells have a unique immunomodulatory function. MSCs&#xD;
      contribute to a critical role in regulating the inflammatory microenvironment and interacting&#xD;
      with immune cells and induce anti- inflammatory macrophages, inhibit foam cell formation,&#xD;
      which could reduce atherosclerosis in pre-clinical studies. Therefore, in this randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial, our aim was to assess the safety and the anti-inflammatory efficacy of&#xD;
      intravenous infusion human umbilical Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem Cell (WJMSC) in&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As biologic, epidemiologic, and clinical trial data have demonstrated, inflammation is a key&#xD;
      driver of coronary artery atherosclerosis, which is associated with pathologic injury and&#xD;
      dysregulation of the endothelial cells lining the luminal wall of arteries, accumulation of&#xD;
      lipids, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, &quot;foam cells&quot;, and aggregated platelets at the&#xD;
      arterial luminal wall, resulting in plaque formation. Circulating biomarkers of inflammation,&#xD;
      including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), are&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events independent of cholesterol and other&#xD;
      traditional risk factors. Recently, a gigantic proof-ofconcept trial CANTOS (Canakinumab&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) showed that an antibody that neutralizes IL&#xD;
      (interleukin)-1β can reduce recurrent cardiovascular events in secondary prevention, which&#xD;
      provides intriguing support for the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis. Moreover,&#xD;
      another agent widely used to treat inflammatory conditions, colchicine,the LoDoCo study&#xD;
      (Low-Dose Colchicine) trial has also showed a highly significant reduction in recurrent&#xD;
      cardiovascular events over a 3-year follow-up, which also showed promise anti-inflammation in&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. Therefore, these studies has demonstrated beyond doubt that&#xD;
      inflammation plays a role in the development of atherothrombosis and, more importantly, that&#xD;
      it can be effectively modulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, fatal infections encountered and high cost in CANTOS. Colchicine causes&#xD;
      gastrointestinal distress sufficient to warrant discontinuation of the medication in over 10%&#xD;
      of individuals, the both of which severely limits the wide range of clinical applications.&#xD;
      Moreover, more recent clinical evidence from the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial&#xD;
      (CIRT) has come to challenge the above presented clinical data. low-dose MTX, when compared&#xD;
      with placebo, failed to reduce the adverse CV events comprising the original primary end&#xD;
      point regarding the cardioprotective effects of MTX. Evidence suggested that the inconsistent&#xD;
      cardioprotective effects of different anti-inflammatory agents may be a reflection of the&#xD;
      distinct pathways targeted. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and immune disease&#xD;
      involving multiple cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, T-lymphocytes, endothelial&#xD;
      cells, smooth muscle cells and mast cells (MCs). Thus, therapies seek to target the intricate&#xD;
      balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways in an attempt to limit inflammation&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest cell biological studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells have a&#xD;
      unique immunomodulatory function. In low-density lipoproteinreceptor knockout mice&#xD;
      atherothrombosis models, MSC-treated mice displayed a signifcant 33% reduction in circulating&#xD;
      LY-6C hei monocytes, a 77% reduction of serum CCL2 levels, and signifcantly affected lesion&#xD;
      development, which was reduced by 33% in the aortic root. These lesions contained 56% less&#xD;
      macrophages and showed a 61% reduction in T cell numbers. MSCs contribute to a critical role&#xD;
      in regulating the inflammatory microenvironment and interacting with immune cells, including&#xD;
      T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). MSC induce anti-&#xD;
      inflammatory macrophages, inhibit foam cell formation, suppress immune responses of&#xD;
      endothelial cells and innate lymphoid cells, and increase phagocytic capacity, which&#xD;
      indirectly suppresses T cell proliferation. More recently, the paracrine potency might vary&#xD;
      with sources and microenvironment of MSCs. MSCs isolated from fetal tissues such as umbilical&#xD;
      cord (UC) and UC-blood (UCB) were shown to have increased secretion of anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      factors (TGF-β,IL-10) and growth factors than MSCs obtained from adult adipose tissue or bone&#xD;
      marrow. Our previous research found that the expression characteristics of special&#xD;
      immunomodulatory genes of human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs) .We&#xD;
      found WJMSCs transplantation significantly reduced the number of inflammatory macrophages&#xD;
      (M1), increased the number of anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) and prevented the expansion&#xD;
      of AMI during early stage of AMI in mouse AMI models. At present, many studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated WJMSC possess a robust immunomodulatory potential and anti-inflammatory effects&#xD;
      through release of secretome consisting of a diverse range of cytokines, chemokines, and&#xD;
      extracellular vesicles (EVs), the cross talk and interplay of WJMSCs and local environment&#xD;
      reversely control and regulate the paracrine activity of MSCs. Thus WJMSCs are important&#xD;
      regulators of immune responses and may hold great potential to be used as a therapeutic in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. In particular safety and feasibility of WJMSCs transplant have been clearly&#xD;
      proved by us and other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the current evidence, systemic paracrinemediated anti-inflammatory effects of WJMSCs&#xD;
      can drive beneficial in therapy of atherosclerosis. These concepts lead to a potentially&#xD;
      transformative strategy that intravenous delivery of WJMSCs, through systemic&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory mechanisms.Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo-&#xD;
      controlled trial, randomly assigning 300 patients with coronary artery disease to receive&#xD;
      three times at 30-day intervals for equal doses of 1x106 /kg of WJMSCs or placebo , to&#xD;
      investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of WJMSCs in patients with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
