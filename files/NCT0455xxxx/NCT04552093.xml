      The PUMP-IT study is designed to prove the feasibility of HAIP chemotherapy with concomitant&#xD;
      standard systemic chemotherapy (FOLFOX and FOLFIRI) in the Netherlands. This study will&#xD;
      include patients with both unresectable CRLM and resectable CRLM with an indication for&#xD;
      upfront systemic therapy (further referred to as potentially resectable CRLM), without&#xD;
      extrahepatic metastases. The study will be performed in two tertiary referral centers in the&#xD;
      Netherlands.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      RATIONALE - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer with an annual incidence&#xD;
      of 14.000 patients in the Netherlands. Of all patients with metastases, 32% have isolated&#xD;
      colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Local treatment of CRLM, i.e. resection, ablation and/or&#xD;
      stereotactic radiotherapy, is the only potentially curative option. Unfortunately over 75% of&#xD;
      these patients have CRLM which are (initially) not suitable for such local treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment of unresectable CRLM includes subsequent lines of systemic (chemo)therapy&#xD;
      aiming to convert the CRLM from an unresectable to a resectable or local treatable state in&#xD;
      order to prolong survival. Conversion rates of modern first line systemic chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      regimens, as described in multiple retrospective studies with highly selected patients, are&#xD;
      observed in 10-76% of patients, resulting in a 5-year survival of 33-43% after conversion.&#xD;
      Patients with progressive disease on first line therapy are offered second line systemic&#xD;
      therapy. Conversion during second line systemic therapy is rare and described in only 7-13.5%&#xD;
      of patients. These patients have a poor prognosis with a median OS of approximately 10-15&#xD;
      months. However, overall survival (OS) of patients undergoing local treatment after&#xD;
      conversion on second line systemic therapy is comparable to what is observed after conversion&#xD;
      on first line systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic arterial infusion pump (HAIP) can deliver high-dose regional chemotherapy to the CRLM&#xD;
      using their unique arterial blood supply. Floxuridine is used for HAIP chemotherapy because&#xD;
      of the advantages of having a half-life of ten minutes, a 95% first-pass effect and allowing&#xD;
      high intrahepatic dosing resulting in increased hepatic exposure by a factor 400, with&#xD;
      minimal systemic exposure (e.g. complications). These specific properties of HAIP&#xD;
      chemotherapy make it possible to combine high-dose local HAIP therapy with standard of care&#xD;
      systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several single center studies from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) (New York,&#xD;
      USA) have shown high response rates with HAIP chemotherapy in combination with systemic&#xD;
      therapy for unresectable CRLM. Conversion to resection of the initially unresectable CRLM&#xD;
      have been observed in up to 57% of chemo-naïve patients and in 20%-38% of patients with prior&#xD;
      systemic therapy treated with the combination of HAIP and systemic therapy. Irrespective of&#xD;
      conversion, the combined therapy resulted in a median OS of 50.8-76.6 months and a 5-year OS&#xD;
      of 51.9% for chemo-naïve patients. The median and 5-year OS was 27.7-35 months and 27.9%,&#xD;
      respectively, for patients who have been treated with systemic therapy before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these results are impressive, they come from a single center and have not yet been&#xD;
      confirmed elsewhere. Most important reasons were the technically challenging surgical&#xD;
      procedure of HAIP implantation and the need for stringent monitoring and specific management&#xD;
      of HAIP chemotherapy requiring a highly skilled multidisciplinary treatment team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study investigating combined treatment is required to prove feasibility in a multicenter&#xD;
      setting outside MSKCC before a multicenter randomized phase III trial can be initiated in the&#xD;
      Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN - All eligible patients who signed informed consent (registration) and meet all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria (inclusion) will undergo surgical HAIP implantation. HAIP function is&#xD;
      evaluated with a perfusion test during surgery and postoperatively before starting drug&#xD;
      treatment. Start of combined HAIP chemotherapy and systemic chemotherapy is aimed within 6&#xD;
      weeks postoperatively. Clinical and laboratory evaluations and chemotherapy administration&#xD;
      are scheduled every two weeks. Response evaluations will be conducted with CT thorax/abdomen&#xD;
      and CEA measurement every 2 HAIP cycles (every 4 systemic chemotherapy cycles) during&#xD;
      combined therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined therapy cycles are continued until disease progression, severe toxicity, CRLM&#xD;
      conversion to surgical local treatment or patients withdrawal. After HAIP chemotherapy&#xD;
      discontinuation, treatment and/or follow-up are according to standard clinical practice.&#xD;
