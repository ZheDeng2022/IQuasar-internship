      The aim of this study is to assess JL1 expression by flow cytometric immunophenotyping in&#xD;
      patients with B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and to correlate it with clinical,&#xD;
      morphological, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic data and response to treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is characterized by a rapidly progressive disease. It&#xD;
      accounts for approximately 75% of all cases of childhood leukemias, that produces large and&#xD;
      immature cells (20% or more lymphoblasts in the bone marrow (BM) and/or the blood) that can't&#xD;
      carry out their normal BM function (Terwilliger and Abdul-Hay, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main cause of ALL lies in the genetic or acquired injury to DNA of a single cell in the&#xD;
      BM with the presence of risk factors such as radiation, benzene exposure, Down syndrome and&#xD;
      past treatment with chemotherapeutic agents which leads to uncontrolled and exaggerated&#xD;
      growth and accumulation of lymphoblasts which fail to function as normal blood cells. This&#xD;
      results in blocking the production of normal blood cells and leads to anemia,&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. The most frequent signs are lymphadenopathies,&#xD;
      hepatosplenomegaly, fever, anemia, signs of hemorrhage, and bone tenderness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognostic factors of ALL include patients' factors such as age, white blood cell (WBC)&#xD;
      count and genetic factors such as chromosome and gene changes along with the immunophenotypic&#xD;
      characteristics of the leukemic blast cells and the individual response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JL1 is a CD43 epitope and mucin family cell surface glycoprotein that is expressed on&#xD;
      leukemic cells. It is expressed on hematopoietic cells at different stages of differentiation&#xD;
      including early stage lymphoid precursors and late stage of myeloid cells. Expression&#xD;
      patterns of JL1 antigen occurs on cell surface of leukemic cells, BM cells and&#xD;
      phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated lymphocytes. Most leukemic cells usually express JL1 even&#xD;
      in weak positive cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JL1 is usually expressed in about 60% of acute leukemia regardless of the lineage. It was&#xD;
      also detected on CD34+ CD10+ lymphoid precursors and some immature myeloid cells in BM. An&#xD;
      anti-JL1 (a monoclonal antibody that is selectively reactive with antigen in spite of the&#xD;
      differences in the molecular weight) is mixed with a toxic substance that target the leukemic&#xD;
      cells which leads to the emergence of its role as a therapeutic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the invistigators aim to study JL1 expression on leukemic cells in ALL patients in&#xD;
      South Egypt Cancer Institute, as we hypothesis that it can be used as an adjunctive marker&#xD;
      for the initial diagnosis and the follow up of ALL.&#xD;
