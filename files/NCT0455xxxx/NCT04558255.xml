  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer with the highest morbidity and mortality in the world.&#xD;
      Stagement is closely related to the 5 years of survival rate of patients. The postoperative&#xD;
      5-year survival rate is above 90% for stage â… A lung cancer patients, while the 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of stage IV lung cancer patients is less than 5%. Therefore, early screening&#xD;
      and diagnosis for lung cancer is a key method to reduce lung cancer mortality and prolong&#xD;
      survival for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the most effective method for early&#xD;
      detection of lung cancer. In addition to imaging examination, plasma tumor markers detection&#xD;
      is also a common clinical detection method for tumor screening and postoperative monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid biopsy is a non-invasive or minimally invasive method for testing blood or other&#xD;
      liquid samples to analyze tumor-related markers including nucleic acids and proteins. Several&#xD;
      studies have explored the detection of hot spot gene mutations, methylation and methylation&#xD;
      changes of DNA, protein markers and autoantibodies in peripheral blood in lung cancer&#xD;
      patients. Liquid biopsy has generally become the most popular field for early diagnosis of&#xD;
      lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based above, it is necessary to combine multi-omics methods to improve the detection of early&#xD;
      stage lung cancer. In our study, we intend to integrate molecular features obtained through&#xD;
      liquid biopsy and clinical data of lung cancer patients, and develop and prospectively&#xD;
      validate a machine-learning method which can robustly discriminate early-stage lung cancer&#xD;
      patients from controls.&#xD;

        500 cases will be enrolled including 100 cases of benign pulmonary nodules, 300 cases of&#xD;
        stage I and II lung cancer, 100 cases of stage III lung cancer. All enrolled patients are&#xD;
        newly diagnosed as pulmonary nodules by imaging, benign and malignant conditions of the&#xD;
        nodules are determined by postoperative pathology after surgical resection. All clinacal&#xD;
        data including cancer stage information are available.&#xD;
