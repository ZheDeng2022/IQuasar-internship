      This study aims to determine the local cutaneous and ocular tolerance of 3 developmental&#xD;
      skin-care products; a serum, a lotion, and a cream in healthy female subjects with clinically&#xD;
      evaluated sensitive facial skin for 21 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, non-comparative, single-blind (evaluator), 3-arm, parallel-group,&#xD;
      single-center, clinical 'in-use' study to determine the local cutaneous and ocular tolerance&#xD;
      profiles of 3 developmental cosmetic facial skincare products; a serum, lotion, and cream in&#xD;
      healthy females with clinically-evaluated sensitive skin as determined by a positive response&#xD;
      to a Lactic Acid Stinging Test (LAST) with signs or symptoms of cutaneous irritation and no&#xD;
      ophthalmological conditions. Assessments will be performed and recorded for 21 days.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Local cutaneous tolerance assessment of participants for irritation determined by a dermatologist on Day 21 of product use</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>A qualified dermatologist will assess the signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation for erythema, dryness, scaling, and edema on a scale with a score range of 0 to 3, where 0=none, 0.5=very slight, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=severe. Cutaneous irritation total score = dermal score of erythema + dermal score of dryness + dermal score of scaling + dermal score of edemas. Total possible score range is 0 to 12 where higher value indicates more cutaneous irritation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local ocular tolerance assessment of participants for irritation determined by an ophthalmologist on Day 21 of product use</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>A qualified ophthalmologist will visually assess the signs and symptoms of ocular irritation for ocular eczema of the eyelid, conjunctivitis, follicles and chemosis conjunctivae on a scale with a score range of 0 to 3, where 0=none, 0.5=very slight, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=severe. Ocular irritation total score = ocular score of eczema of the eyelid + ocular score of conjunctivitis + ocular score of follicles + ocular score of chemosis conjunctivae. Total possible score range is 0 to 12 where higher value indicates more ocular irritation.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 1-2 hours post first use</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the local cutaneous, participants were instructed to self-assess any sensations of cutaneous discomfort for redness, dryness, stinging/burning, itching and tightness on a scale with a score range of 0 to 3, where 0=none, 0.5=very slight, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=severe. Participant self-assessment of cutaneous irritation total score = redness + dryness + itching + stinging/burning + tightness. Total possible score range is 0 to 15, where higher value indicates more cutaneous irritation. Change from baseline at 1 to 2 hours post first use = total score at 1 to 2 hours minus total score at baseline.</description>
