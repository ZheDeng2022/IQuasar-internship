      A pilot study to test a novel model for PrEP initiation and refills in Kenya: pharmacy-based&#xD;
      PrEP delivery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new HIV prevention method that works when taken as&#xD;
      recommended. To take full advantage of public health benefit of PrEP for HIV prevention,&#xD;
      there is need to prioritize access, minimize costs of delivery, and reach out to at-risk&#xD;
      populations. In Africa, PrEP is being added to a public health infrastructure which is&#xD;
      sometimes burdened by overcrowding and drug stock outs; the ability of health systems to&#xD;
      maximize PrEP access necessitates finding novel delivery strategies. Additionally, there&#xD;
      exist major barriers to PrEP delivery, which includes stigma, long waiting times, costs of&#xD;
      staffing and healthcare providers' unfamiliarity with delivering prevention interventions. In&#xD;
      Kenya, and many other resource-limited countries, retail pharmacies (i.e., chemists) fill an&#xD;
      important gap in the health care system providing first stop access to treatment, monitoring&#xD;
      and preventive care of urgent and prolonged conditions. Potential PrEP users may desire&#xD;
      pharmacy-delivered PrEP over facility-delivered PrEP for reasons including increased&#xD;
      convenience, increased privacy and greater engagement compared to health facilities that&#xD;
      focus on treating ill patients. Retail pharmacies can offer free, subsidized or affordable&#xD;
      healthcare services. The core components of PrEP - including HIV testing, adherence and risk&#xD;
      reduction counselling, assessment of side effects and provision of refills - are within the&#xD;
      scope of practice for pharmaceutical technologists and pharmacists in Kenya. Prior formative&#xD;
      qualitative research and a stakeholder meeting led to development of a care pathway for&#xD;
      pharmacy-based PrEP delivery (including initiation and refills), endorsed for piloting in a&#xD;
      consultation meeting that included a wide spectrum of regulatory, professional, government,&#xD;
      and community stakeholders in Kenya. This study will pilot this care pathway in six retail&#xD;
      pharmacies in two different geographies in Kenya: Kisumu and Thika. Activities will include&#xD;
      data collection aimed at potential weak points of pharmacy-based PrEP delivery, in domains&#xD;
      relating to acceptability, fidelity, and costs.&#xD;
