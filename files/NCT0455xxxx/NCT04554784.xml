  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized study is to explore the effectiveness of Bowen&#xD;
      Therapy in pain management for patients with fibromyalgia. In Hong Kong, Bowen Therapy is a&#xD;
      non-invasive technique and one of the treatment modalities adopted by Occupational&#xD;
      Therapists. Bowen Therapy uses specific sequences of gentle cross-fibre moves over muscles,&#xD;
      tendons, ligaments, and fascia to stimulate or improve the flow of blood and lymph, and thus&#xD;
      activate the body's healing mechanisms that enhances tissue repair. As a result, it can&#xD;
      lessen pain and tension, restore more optimal body function, and subsequently alleviate&#xD;
      emotional and psychological stress associated with the pain. Bowen Therapy is widely&#xD;
      recognized and utilized worldwide for acute and chronic health conditions from new-born to&#xD;
      the elderly, both mobilized and bed-ridden patients with no documented evidence to show it&#xD;
      has caused any harm or adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two study groups in this study and patients will be randomized and allocated to&#xD;
      either one. One group (Control group) will continue receiving conventional treatment; while&#xD;
      another group (Bowen group) will receive 8 sessions of Bowen therapy. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that Bowen Therapy is superior to the conventional pain treatment for patients&#xD;
      with fibromyalgia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is going to look at the effectiveness of Bowen Therapy in pain management for&#xD;
      patients with fibromyalgia. 80 patients with fibromyalgia attending pain management clinic&#xD;
      will be recruited at Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital after informed consent. They will&#xD;
      be randomized into either group (control group or Bowen group). Control group will continue&#xD;
      receiving conventional treatment such as follow-ups by pain specialists, taking analgesia,&#xD;
      physiotherapy. Bowen group will need to attend 8 sessions of therapy. All subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 12th week and 24th week after signing the consent.&#xD;

The randomization sequence will be prepared by a research assistant, who will not take part in the study.

    <time_frame>3 different time points that include before the study (0 week), the mid term (12th week) and end of the study (24th weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>For the test of lower extremities, study subjects will be asked to sit comfortably on a chair with the back straight. The arms are extended parallel to the trunk with the elbow and shoulder in 0° of flexion/extension, and each hand hold a dumbbell weighing 2.5kg. On receiving a signal from a metronome, subjects rise to a full standing position (body erect and straight), and at the next signal of the metronome, they return back to the initial seated position, maintaining arm extension. The pace of the metronome is 60 beats per minute and 90° of movement per second. The score is measured as the total number of stands executed correctly until the participant cannot keep up with the pace of the metronome.</description>

    <time_frame>3 different time points that include before the study (0 week), the mid term (12th week) and end of the study (24th weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>For the test of upper extremities, you sit on the same chair, leaning back completely, extending the dominant arm parallel to the trunk with the elbow and shoulder in 0° of flexion/extension, and holding a dumbbell weighing 2.5kg. At the signal of the metronome, you bend the weight through a full range of elbow flexion. At the next signal of the metronome, you return to the initial position, keeping the back straight. The pace of the metronome is 60 beats per minute and 120° of movement per second. The score is measured as the total number of curls executed correctly until you cannot keep up with the pace of the metronome. This test is repeated on the other arm. The tests are approximately 5 to 10 minutes per patient.</description>

    <intervention_name>Bowen</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will be referred to Occupational therapist for Bowen Therapy. There will be a week washout period before the start of Bowen Therapy. During a week washout period and study period, patients can continue taking analgesia, but advised to stop the concurrent treatments which can affect the deep tissue such as massage, physiotherapy, and chiropractic to minimize the counteracting effect on the Bowen's action.&#xD;
During a Bowen Therapy session, patients will lie relaxed on the examination couch wearing loosely fitting clothing or only the affected area being exposed. The therapist applies a series of gentle movements across the body. The gentle movements focus on a body of muscle, tendon or nerve and release tension through the nerve within the area. Each session will last for 30 minutes to an hour. After each session, the next appointment will be given to patients. The first four sessions will be scheduled on weekly basis, and the remaining four on biweekly session.</description>
