  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bridging the Gap aims to improve access to effective mental health treatment in a primary&#xD;
      care setting through utilization of single session growth mindset interventions for parents&#xD;
      and for youths. This project will also utilize focus groups and qualitative interviews to&#xD;
      gain feedback on a single session online intervention in a rural pediatric primary care&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bridging the Gap purposes to collect feedback on a single session growth mindset intervention&#xD;
      (GMI) for parents and for youths designed to instill beliefs that personal traits (including&#xD;
      mental health problems) are malleable. Feedback will also be collected to identify ways to&#xD;
      improve implementing single session interventions (SSIs) in a primary care setting as well as&#xD;
      identifying the impact on work-flow of this GMI. Patients presenting with depression and/or&#xD;
      anxiety will all receive the GMI and will have the option of participating in focus&#xD;
      groups/interviews pre and post-intervention to provide feedback on the intervention.&#xD;
      Providers at this rural pediatric primary care practice will also have the chance to&#xD;
      participate in focus groups/interviews pre and post-intervention implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment of Interventions: As an open trial, all participants will be assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention arm and will receive the GMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open trial pilot project to collect feedback on a single session growth&#xD;
      mindset intervention (GMI) (n=25 youth/caretaker dyads). Feedback from pre and&#xD;
      post-intervention focus groups/interviews will be collected for 8 parents, 8 youth, and 8&#xD;
      treatment providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collect feedback from providers, parents, and participants pre and post- GMI to identify&#xD;
           ways to improve implementing single session interventions (SSIs) in a primary care&#xD;
           setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify the impact on work-flow of using an online single session called Growth Mindset&#xD;
           Intervention in a primary care setting.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in child and parental attitudes towards therapy at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline vs. 4 week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Child and parental attitudes towards therapy will be assessed via Attitudes Towards Therapy Scale, as the primary outcome of Bridging the Gap. Scores on this one question assessment range from 0= view of therapy as not at all helpful to 10= view of therapy as very helpful.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in view of emotions as changeable at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline vs. 4 week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Child and parental views of personality as changeable will be assessed via Implicit Theory of Emotions Scale, as the primary outcome of Bridging the Gap. The Implicit Theory of Emotion contains 4 questions, with two incremental items and two entity items. Each item is rated using a 7-point Likert scale with 1= strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree. The two entity items are reverse-scored. Scores range from 4-28 and higher scores indicate a view of emotions as changeable.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in view of personality as changeable at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline vs. 4 week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Child and parental views of personality as changeable will be assessed via Implicit Theory of Personality Questionnaire, as the primary outcome of Bridging the Gap. The Implicit Theory of Personality Questionnaire contains 3 questions with a range of scores from 3 to 18, with lower scores indicating a view of personality as changeable.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hopelessness</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Child and parent hopelessness will be assessed via Beck Hopelessness Short Scale, as the primary outcome of Bridging the Gap. This 4-item scale is totaled using the sum of item scores. Scores range from 0-12, with higher scores indicating more hopelessness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Child anxiety severity will be assessed via SCARED 5-item, as a secondary outcome of Bridging the Gap. This 5-item assessment has scores ranging from 0-10, with higher scores indicating more self-reported anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Child and parent depression severity will be assessed via MFQ questionnaire, as a secondary outcome of Bridging the Gap. The MFQ Child version has scores ranging from 0-66, with a higher score indicating more severe depression. The MFQ Parent version has scores ranging from 0-69, with higher score indicating more severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Psychological distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Child and parent psychological distress will be assessed via PHQ4 questionnaire, as a secondary outcome of Bridging the Gap. The PHQ4 contains 4 questions, 2 questions relating to depression and 2 questions relating to anxiety, with scores ranging from 0-12. Higher scores on the PHQ4 indicate more severe psychological distress.</description>
