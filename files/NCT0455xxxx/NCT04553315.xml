    <textblock>
      the study attempted to assess and evaluate the efficacy of implementing chest expansion&#xD;
      exercises on patients with pleural effusion and how this programme contribute to reduce&#xD;
      pulmonary infection and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the objective of the study, the researcher utilized chest expansion exercises&#xD;
      consisted of stacked breathing exercise, segmental breathing, chest mobility exercises, deep&#xD;
      breathing exercise with use of incentve spirometer and assess the patient before and after&#xD;
      exercises by using three tools help to monitor hemodynamic parameters, chest condition,&#xD;
      laboratory investigations which help to evaluate pulmonary infection score and complications.&#xD;

      Introduction Plural effusion is a syndrome occurs frequently in hospitalized patients,&#xD;
      leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure. A plural effusion&#xD;
      represents the disturbance of the normal mechanisms of formation and drainage of fluid from&#xD;
      the plural space .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plural effusion is defined as a ﬂuid collection between the plural leaves due to&#xD;
      local/systemic disease of the pleura, lung or extra-pulmonary organs. Normally, 0.1 to 0.2&#xD;
      ml/kg of ﬂuid is present in the plural leaves to facilitate plural movement. When the balance&#xD;
      between the production and re-absorption of this ﬂuid deteriorates, it becomes plural&#xD;
      effusion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accumulation of plural effusion has important effects on respiratory system function. It&#xD;
      changes the elastic equilibrium volumes of the lung and chest wall, resulting in a&#xD;
      restrictive ventilatory effect, chest wall expansion and reduced efficiency of the&#xD;
      inspiratory muscles. The magnitude of these alterations depends on the plural fluid volume&#xD;
      and the underlying disease of the respiratory system. The decrease in lung volume is&#xD;
      associated with hypoxemia mainly due to an increase in right to left shunt. The drainage of&#xD;
      pleural fluid results in an increase in lung volume that is considerably less than the amount&#xD;
      of aspirated fluid, while hypoxemia is not readily reversible upon fluid aspiration .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleural effusions are traditionally classified as either transudates or exudates. Diseases&#xD;
      that affect the filtration of pleural fluid result in transudate formation and often occur&#xD;
      bilaterally. Inflammation or injury increases pleural capillary membrane permeability to&#xD;
      proteins and various types of cells and lead to the formation of an exudative effusion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a randomised controlled trial to determine the effect of chest&#xD;
      expansion exercises on reducing pulmonary infection and complications on patients with plural&#xD;
      effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Design Structured as a randomized-controlled prospective study, the objective of this&#xD;
      study was to determine the efficacy of the chest expansion exercises on reducing pulmonary&#xD;
      infection and complications on patients with plural effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting Data was collected from chest ICU and critical ICU in Assiut university hospital .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample The study population consisted of patients eighteen to sixty years old, hospitalized&#xD;
      and treated in Critical, Chest intensive care units. The inclusion criteria stipulated that&#xD;
      the patient was between eighteen and sixty years old; both genders were included; diagnosed&#xD;
      as plural effusion by the physician; and with a symmetrical chest expansion and agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study. A power calculation estimated that in order to detect an effect&#xD;
      size of 0.29 difference in mean of pulmonary function between the two studied groups, with a&#xD;
      p-value &lt; 0.05 and 80 % power, confidence level 0.95, a sample size of 20 patients for each&#xD;
      group was needed. However, 60 patients were attempted in this research work to avoid&#xD;
      non-response rate (30 for each group). This calculated using G Power 3.1 . The study data was&#xD;
      collected between June 2019 and June 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments and measurements Three tools used in this study were developed by the researcher&#xD;
      based on reviewing of the relevant literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first tool was Plural effusion assessment sheet used to monitor hemodynamic parameters&#xD;
      included (Mean arterial pressure (MAP) taken from bed side monitor, heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      temperature, respiratory rate and CVP readings, assessment of respiratory system consisted of&#xD;
      : Chest examination done every shift before and after exercise, chest x-ray assessment,&#xD;
      Sputum and blood culture assessment, Ventilator profile assessment , assessment of plural&#xD;
      procedures done, assessment of clinical pulmonary infection score, fluid balance assessment.,&#xD;
      assessment of laboratory findings in addition to socio-demographic and medical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second tool is Chest expansion exercises sheet : was developed by the researcher and used&#xD;
      to assess exercises done to the patient and included: Chest mobility exercise; Stacked&#xD;
      breathing exercise; Segmental breathing exercise; Deep breathing exercise and Incentive&#xD;
      spirometer exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third tool is Patients' outcomes evaluation sheet which was developed by the researcher&#xD;
      and used to assess the effect of chest expansion exercises on pulmonary infection score and&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention After getting ethical clearance patients were enrolled in the study, patients&#xD;
      were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following an initial assessment,&#xD;
      the patients were assigned to one of the two groups by block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group was received Chest mobility exercises with Incentive spirometer and&#xD;
      segmental breathing exercise and breath stacking technique . The patient in the intervention&#xD;
      group was instructed to perform the exercises 3 times per day, 7-8 times per session for one&#xD;
      week. Ensure that the patient fully hydrated by maintaining normal daily water requirement in&#xD;
      the form of (30-35 ml/kg/day) with restriction of intravenous fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The data were collected from the first day of admission after stabilization&#xD;
      of the patient's condition and extended to 7 days, every day and every shift then the data&#xD;
      were recorded in the developed tools.The researcher assigned study sample (30 patients) to&#xD;
      two groups (Control group, Intervention group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the control group: The researcher assessed patients who were receiving the routine&#xD;
      hospital care. For Intervention group: The researcher assessed patients then applying chest&#xD;
      expansion exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations There was no risk for study subject during application of the study as&#xD;
      the study followed common ethical principles in clinical research and has been carried out in&#xD;
      accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki)&#xD;
      and written consent was obtained from patients or guidance that participated in the study&#xD;
      after explaining the nature and purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient was assured that the data of this research was not be reused without second&#xD;
      permission, confidentiality and anonymity was assured and the patients had the right to&#xD;
      refuse to participate or withdraw from the study without any rational at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Data were computerized and analyzed by computer programmed SPSS (ver.16). Data&#xD;
      were presented by using descriptive statistics in the form of frequencies and percentages or&#xD;
      means ± standard deviations for qualitative data. Quantitative data were compared using&#xD;
      Independent samples t-test for comparisons among two groups. Qualitative variables were&#xD;
      compared using chi-square test to determine significance. The critical value of the tests &quot;P&quot;&#xD;
      was considered statistically significant when P less than 0.05.&#xD;
