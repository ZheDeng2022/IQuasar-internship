    <textblock>
      In context of an increase of bacterial infections in people who inject psychoactive&#xD;
      substances (PS) all around the world and a lack of available scientific data, the&#xD;
      investigators decided to set up a descriptive study on bacterial infection types and&#xD;
      determinants in Injection Drug Users (IDUs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a multidisciplinary approach between hospital departments (e.g. infectious diseases,&#xD;
      emergency and addictology), the local addiction management and liaison team (ELSA) and the&#xD;
      regional addictovigilance center, data were collected on appearance and course of bacterial&#xD;
      infections in IDUs hospitalized at Montpellier University Hospital, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to provide medical data in order to better understand those infections and&#xD;
      their determinants and provide information for potential future more specific observational&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regional addictovigilance center is a member of the French Addictovigilance Network,&#xD;
      which was established to monitor the potential for abuse and dependence of PS, and to provide&#xD;
      information on the risk of addiction and advice for public health decision making, under the&#xD;
      supervision of the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety. This&#xD;
      surveillance system is principally based on spontaneous reporting by healthcare professionals&#xD;
      and patients that is regulated by law. Collected data were extracted from those spontaneous&#xD;
      reports (composed by data from the medical file*, DxCare or notification by medical team).&#xD;
      First data were collected in 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators offered patients to fill in an anonymous questionnaire** on&#xD;
      hygiene habits which was not mandatory and had no influence on treatment, and was offered&#xD;
      during the ELSA team intervention (questions from the questionnaire are classical risk&#xD;
      reduction question on injection and hygiene practices).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main results are the description of the infections and injection practices. There is no&#xD;
      control group per se as all included patients are IDUs and have a bacterial infection. But&#xD;
      the investigators infection (such as abscess or skin and soft tissue) and those with a&#xD;
      systemic infection. The two groups were established after the recruitment was completed. This&#xD;
      comparative analysis is only performed in order to better understand the development of&#xD;
      infections. Descriptive and comparative analyses was performed by the Department of Medical&#xD;
      Information.&#xD;
