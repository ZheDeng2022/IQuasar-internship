  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled multicenter trail comparing physical therapy to surgical&#xD;
      decompression in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. The 0-hypothesis is that there is no&#xD;
      difference in the efficacy of structured physical therapy compared to surgical decompression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to evaluate if physical therapy can serve as a nonsurgical alternative for&#xD;
      patients with LSS, where the severity of symptoms indicates the need of surgical&#xD;
      decompression.&#xD;

    <description>Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI) is the most commonly used condition-specific outcome measure for spinal disorders in general. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with a lower score indicating less severe pain and disability. It has been validated into Norwegian and tested for psychometric properties.</description>

    <measure>Improvement of walking and standing capacity measured with accelerometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use a body-worn tri-axial lightweight accelerometer (AX3 sensor from Axivity, York, UK) attached by a waterproof tape to the midpoint of the patients' anterior right thigh and at the lower back.&#xD;
Daily physical activity such as walking, running, standing, sitting, lying down and cycling will be monitored. By comparing the continuous activity for one week before treatment, for one week at six-, and 12-month follow-up, we will be able to objectively report about changes in the activity level (25). Since LSS-patients have symptoms while walking and standing, we will report the activity as ratios of walking/standing compare to other activity, as well as summon the three longest walking/standing periods before and after treatment.</description>
