      1. To detect accuracy of MDCT in differentiation between different types of ascites and its&#xD;
           underlying cause .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of measuring the CT density of the ascitic fluid (in&#xD;
           Housefield units) to differentiate between different types of ascites in comparison to&#xD;
           aspiration cytology results.&#xD;
