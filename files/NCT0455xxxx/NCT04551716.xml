    <textblock>
      Attenuation imaging (ATI) technology independently developed by Canon medical is a&#xD;
      non-invasive examination technology for quantitative detection and analysis of liver&#xD;
      steatosis. The technique is simple, rapid and quantitative diagnosis, and is suitable for&#xD;
      screening and popularization of early liver steatosis in MAFLD. As noninvasive and effective&#xD;
      detection measures of liver inflammation and liver fibrosis, SWD and SWE are more and more&#xD;
      widely used in the quantitative diagnosis of liver inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, ATI&#xD;
      combined with SWD / SWE detection can quantitatively diagnose different pathological stages&#xD;
      (steatosis, necrotizing inflammation and liver fibrosis) in the development of MAFLD, so as&#xD;
      to provide an important basis for treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  According to the diagnostic criteria of metabolic related fatty liver disease: liver&#xD;
             steatosis detected by imaging or blood biomarker / score or liver histology, and&#xD;
             meeting one of the following three criteria, namely overweight / obesity (BMI ≥ 23 kg&#xD;
             / m2), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or metabolic disorders. 1) The criteria for&#xD;
             metabolic disorders are at least two of the following abnormalities:&#xD;
             a.waistline≥90/80cm(male/female);b.Blood pressure ≥ 130 / 85 mmHg or drug treatment;&#xD;
             c.Plasma triglyceride ≥ 150 mg / dl (≥ 1.70 mmol / L) or special drug treatment;&#xD;
             d.Plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol: male &lt; 40 mg / dl (&lt; 1.0 mmol / L),&#xD;
             female &lt; 50 mg / dl (&lt; 1.3 mmol / L) or special drug treatment; e.Prediabetes (i.e.,&#xD;
             fasting blood glucose levels of 100 to 125 mg / dl [5.6 to 6.9 mmol / l], or 2 hours&#xD;
             after a meal Blood glucose levels were 140 to 199 mg / dl [7.8 to 11.0 mmol] or HbA1c&#xD;
             5.7% to 6.4% [39 to 47 mmol / mol]); f.The steady-state model assessment of insulin&#xD;
             resistance score was ≥ 2.5; g.Plasma C-reactive protein level was &gt; 2 mg / L. 2) The&#xD;
             patients agree to join the study voluntarily and signed the informed consent form. 3)&#xD;
             There was no significant risk of bleeding (platelet ≥ 50x109 / L, prothrombin activity&#xD;
             ≥ 50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1) The pregnant. 2) Patients who have received or are undergoing systemic&#xD;
             chemotherapy. 3) Patients with hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease (more than 5 years&#xD;
             of drinking history, equivalent to alcohol volume ≥ 40g / D in male and ≥ 20g / D in&#xD;
             female), drug-induced liver disease or autoimmune hepatitis. 4) Those who refuse to&#xD;
             sign informed consent; 5) There was a significant risk of bleeding (platelet &lt; 50x109&#xD;
             / L, prothrombin activity &lt; 50%).&#xD;
