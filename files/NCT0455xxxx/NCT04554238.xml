  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (CP) generates an impact on daily activities,&#xD;
      mainly due to the functional limitation of the affected upper limb. The use of technologies&#xD;
      such as Armeo spring robotic therapy seeks to improve upper limb mobility through innovative&#xD;
      and motivating training that facilitates movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the effectiveness of Armeo spring robotic therapy versus conventional&#xD;
      occupational therapy regarding the changes in upper limb functionality of children with&#xD;
      unilateral spastic CP infiltrated simultaneously with botulinum toxin A (BTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: Randomized clinical trial of parallel groups, in children between 4 and&#xD;
      10 years of age diagnosed with unilateral spastic CP and infiltrates with BTA, who received&#xD;
      treatment of conventional occupational therapy (group I) or Armeo spring robotic therapy&#xD;
      (group II). The intervention consists of 15 sessions of 40 minutes for 5 weeks, 3 times a&#xD;
      week. An initial evaluation is applied with QUEST, ABILHAND-Kids, and MACS, which are&#xD;
      re-evaluated at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Armeo spring robotic therapy will obtain better results than conventional&#xD;
      occupational therapy in relation to the functionality of the upper limb at the level of&#xD;
      manipulative function, quality of movement of the limb and the performance of daily&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The results of the QUEST and ABILHAND-Kids dimensions assessed before,&#xD;
      after and at follow-up will be the primary outcome. The presence of adverse effects will&#xD;
      correspond to secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit and limitations: Direct social contribution for patient's rehabilitation by using&#xD;
      technology and a contribution to research to update scientific evidence. Possible limitations&#xD;
      could be presence of adverse effects and poor adherence to treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will contemplate the description of the clinical characteristics of the patients to&#xD;
      intervene (sex, age, locality and Manual Classification of Skills system in children with CP&#xD;
      - MACS), and the main results consider the quality upper extremity skills test and the&#xD;
      questionnaire of Abilhand-kids. Among the secondary outcomes, the presence of adverse effects&#xD;
      and adherence to the intervention will be considered, through the record of attendance at the&#xD;
      sessions.In relation to standard operating procedures, no statistical calculation of the&#xD;
      sample size will be performed as the entire available population will be covered. All&#xD;
      children with spastic unilateral Cerebral Palsy between 4 and 10 years of the year 2018 will&#xD;
      be selected at Instituto Teletón in the city of Concepción, Chile. The list of those who have&#xD;
      recently been infiltrated with botulinum toxin type A in the upper limb and those who have an&#xD;
      indication for admission to treatment will be reviewed. A list will be made with the selected&#xD;
      users, assigning the child a number for random selection to a specific study group. The list&#xD;
      will be sent to the Subdirección de Investigación - Dirección Médica Nacional of Teletón&#xD;
      Chile to maintain the masking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned using specialized software to the study group (Armeo)&#xD;
      and the control group (conventional therapy) to ensure that each participant has an equal&#xD;
      probability of being assigned to either of the two groups. After finishing the Armeo spring&#xD;
      group treatment and conventional Occupational Therapy, a post-intervention evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed at 3 months and follow-up at 6 months.The data collection will be carried out&#xD;
      later, through specific sources: clinical history, interview, evaluation guideline, clinical&#xD;
      observation and attendance record. To guarantee the registration procedure, it will be&#xD;
      determined that at the end of each evaluation period (initial evaluation, post intervention&#xD;
      and follow-up) the evaluator will immediately transfer the information to the database, and&#xD;
      it will be verified that it matches the evaluated user through the clinical history number&#xD;
      assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The processing and statistical analysis of the data will be coded in an Excel spreadsheet and&#xD;
      will be processed using statistical software SPSS v17.0. A normality test will be performed&#xD;
      to verify the distribution of the data. According to this result, the corresponding position&#xD;
      and dispersion measures will be obtained. To contrast the values of the intragroup variables&#xD;
      at the different evaluation times, repeated measures tests will be used and, to evaluate the&#xD;
      differences between the study groups, T test or Kruskal Wallis tests will be used,&#xD;
      considering a level of significance of 5%. As safety considerations for participants, it is&#xD;
      that the treatment will be suspended in the event of the presence of adverse events, for&#xD;
      example, skin lesions, pain and fatigue.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The type of study to be developed corresponds to a parallel group randomized clinical trial (RCT) with a superiority study framework, as it seeks to compare the effectiveness of Armeo spring robotic therapy versus conventional occupational therapy in terms of the functionality of the upper limb of children with hemiparesis infiltrated simultaneously with BTA. The trial phase corresponds to phase III.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Regarding masking, it is impossible for the treating occupational therapist to be unaware of the treatment to be carried out by the treated patient, just as it is impossible for the patient not to identify the treatment to which they access, therefore, this study is single-blind, considering only who performs the evaluations of the study will not know which group corresponds to the evaluated patient.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline of &quot;Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test&quot; score at 3 and 6 months post intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Before, after the interventions (3 months) and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality Upper Extremity Ability Test (QUEST) assesses the quality of upper extremity function in four domains: dissociated movements, grip, protective extension, and weight-bearing. It was designed to evaluate children with neuromotor dysfunction with spasticity and has been validated in children 18 to 8 years of age.&#xD;
The scale presents a specific score for each dimension, which is added, and the final value that is transformed into a final percentage (0-100%). This percentage obtained is the one that is statistically analyzed, understanding that a higher percentage represents a better quality of movement.&#xD;
The QUEST allows an evaluation of the quality of the movements of one and two hands in individuals with CP but does not allow an evaluation of the quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline of &quot;Measure of manual ability for children with upper limb impairments; ABILHAND-kids&quot; score at 3 and 6 months post intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Before, after the interventions (3 months) and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The ABILHAND-Kids scale (measure of manual ability for children with upper limb impairments) consists of 21 items, mostly bimanual, rated by the parents. Parents report a better perception of their children's ability than the children themselves.&#xD;
On this scale, each task had a numerical assignment according to the difficulty perceived by the father: easy = 1; difficult = 2 and impossible = 3, from which the average was obtained, which was statistically analyzed. It is considered that the decrease in the values corresponds to a perception of a greater number of activities that are easy to carry out by the child.&#xD;
ABILHAND-Kids is responsive to detect changes after clinical trials using intensive training in children with unilateral CP. Therefore, this scale is potentially useful for assessing functional status.</description>
