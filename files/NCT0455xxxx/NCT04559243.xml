    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a prospective, multi-center, non-interventional study designed to&#xD;
      investigate the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous LAA appendage closure by using&#xD;
      LAmbre™ Left Atrial Appendage Occluder System. 579 patients with valvular AF complicated with&#xD;
      previous AF-related embolic events (including ischemic stroke, TIA and systemic embolism)&#xD;
      were enrolled at about 20 study sites nationwide. The baseline data, operation process and&#xD;
      relevant follow-up information of subjects were recorded at 7 months after operation or&#xD;
      before discharge and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after operation.&#xD;

      Study Population Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and previous AF-related&#xD;
      embolic events Purpose To assess the feasibility and safety of percutaneous LAA closure as&#xD;
      secondary prevention for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and previous&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (AF) related embolic events (including ischemic stroke, transient&#xD;
      ischemic attack (TIA), and systemic embolism).&#xD;
