    <textblock>
      Although the cause of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is unknown,&#xD;
      physicians sometimes try to treat it with antibiotics or alpha-receptor blockers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter, double-blind factorial trial, 196 men with moderately severe CP/CPPS&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of treatment with ciprofloxacin, tamsulosin, both drugs, or&#xD;
      placebo. Neither ciprofloxacin nor tamsulosin substantively reduced symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ciprofloxacin and tamsulosin were not effective treatments for CP/CPPS. Patients had&#xD;
      long-standing, refractory CP/CPPS and received trial treatments for only 6 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      with new diagnoses who are given longer courses of the trial treatments might respond&#xD;
      differently.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder and accounts&#xD;
      for approximately 2 million visits to physicians annually in the United States. The&#xD;
      substantial impact of CP/CPPS includes bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms, sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction, reduced quality of life, and increased health care expenditures. The syndrome is&#xD;
      diagnosed only on the basis of symptoms, principally pain or discomfort in the pelvic region.&#xD;
      No objective measures can help define the disease. Although bacteria can infect the prostate,&#xD;
      most men with prostatitis have a negative midstream urine culture, indicating that bacteria&#xD;
      may not be the cause of their symptoms. Such men are classified as having National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health (NIH) category III prostatitis, the most common of the clinically defined&#xD;
      prostatitis syndromes. It is by no means clear that the disease is characterized by&#xD;
      inflammation of the prostate or that the prostate is responsible for symptoms in a&#xD;
      substantial proportion of patients. Because of this uncertainty, the term CP/CPPS is used.&#xD;
      Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is commonly seen by primary care&#xD;
      practitioners, internists, and urologists. In the Olmsted County Study of Urinary Symptoms&#xD;
      and Health Status Among Men, a population-based study in Olmstead County, Minnesota, the&#xD;
      overall prevalence rate of a physician-assigned diagnosis of prostatitis was 9%.&#xD;
      Population-based surveys of symptoms have estimated that the prevalence of the syndrome&#xD;
      ranges from 9% to 12% among men. It is difficult to estimate the proportion of patients with&#xD;
      symptoms lasting longer than 3 months whose disorder remains refractory to empirical therapy.&#xD;
      These patients are commonly seen by urologists, but whether they represent a minor&#xD;
      subpopulation of the overall symptomatic group or make up the majority of patients is&#xD;
      unknown. The investigators chose to study these patients because they present with a&#xD;
      troubling, long-standing problem and are usually treated with agents of unclear benefit. Even&#xD;
      if a relatively large number of men whose symptoms last 3 months or more are cured by&#xD;
      standard empirical therapy and the clinical scenario the investigators describe is uncommon,&#xD;
      men with refractory symptoms still present a substantial problem to internists and urologists&#xD;
      who have little information to guide therapy. Because the cause of CP/CPPS is unknown,&#xD;
      affected men receive many empirical therapies. The 2 most common treatments prescribed by&#xD;
      physicians are antimicrobial agents and alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists, although there&#xD;
      is little objective evidence to support their use. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, are&#xD;
      commonly used to treat CP/CPPS because of their excellent penetration into the prostate and&#xD;
      broad spectrum of coverage for uropathogens and other organisms traditionally believed to be&#xD;
      associated with the syndrome. Tamsulosin, an alpha-blocker, is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and it has been&#xD;
      hypothesized that tamsulosin may improve these symptoms in men with CP/CPPS. This randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial was designed to evaluate whether ciprofloxacin or tamsulosin reduces symptoms&#xD;
      of long-standing CP/CPPS of at least moderate severity, typical of the 488 men in our Chronic&#xD;
      Prostatitis Cohort Study. The primary purpose of the trial was to test the most common&#xD;
      prescription treatments given to men with CP/CPPS, who are commonly seen in our&#xD;
      referral-based urologic practices.&#xD;
