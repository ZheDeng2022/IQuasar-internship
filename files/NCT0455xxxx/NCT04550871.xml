  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine what percent of severe patient-ventilator asynchrony&#xD;
      is detected in mechanically ventilated patients in the adult ICU and to determine delays in&#xD;
      detecting those asynchronies by the staff that were correctly identified, and whether&#xD;
      asynchrony status recorded during intermittent assessments by respiratory therapists is&#xD;
      representative of periods in between such assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study. All decisions about ventilator settings, mode of&#xD;
      ventilation, and sedative doses are determined by the critical care team attending to the&#xD;
      patient. Patients will be enrolled within 6 hours after intubation and will be studied&#xD;
      continuously until extubation. Patients will be monitored for asynchrony using Syncron-E&#xD;
      tablets provided by Autonomous Healthcare. However, clinical staff will be blinded to the&#xD;
      results of the tablet, and hence, there will be no change to clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asynchrony index (which captures the fraction of breaths with asynchrony) will be calculated&#xD;
      every minute by the Syncron-E tablet. The assessment of respiratory therapists at the time of&#xD;
      ventilator checks will also be recorded including the following information: i)&#xD;
      entering/exiting the room , ii) existence of a severe asynchrony episode based on the&#xD;
      respiratory therapist's assessment and its type. Clinical staff will record the start of any&#xD;
      severe asynchrony episode that they detect. Data related to the administrations of sedatives&#xD;
      and anesthetics as well as major interventions (excluding any PHI) will also be recorded.&#xD;

    <description>The endpoints will be calculated starting from the end of each ventilator check (when the respiratory therapist is leaving the room) and cover the time from that time point until 5-minutes prior to the next ventilator check event. The endpoints will also be separately calculated for the 5-minute period immediately preceding the next ventilator check.</description>
