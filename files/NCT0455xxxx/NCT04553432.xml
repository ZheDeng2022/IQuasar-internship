    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) is a disease of the ocular surface characterised by ocular surface&#xD;
      inflammation and damage and neurosensory abnormalities. Tear film breakup leading to&#xD;
      localised hyperosmolarity can result in ocular surface damage either directly or through the&#xD;
      cascade of inflammation that it initiates. Transplantation of human amniotic membrane has&#xD;
      been used for many ophthalmic indications including many related to inflammation of the&#xD;
      ocular surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study published by McDonald and colleagues in 2018 conducted in 84 DED patients (97&#xD;
      eyes) receiving cryopreserved AM treatment (Prokera) in addition to prior maximal medical&#xD;
      management demonstrated an improved ocular surface along with a notable reduction in disease&#xD;
      severity scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omnigen is a dehydrated amniotic membrane derived from human sources and certified by the UK&#xD;
      Human Tissue Authority. OmniLenz Bandage Contact Lens (BCL) is a bespoke bandage contact lens&#xD;
      (BCL) designed to enable the application of Omnigen without the need for either sutures or&#xD;
      glue. The application procedure takes approximately 15 minutes and the patients wear the lens&#xD;
      continually. The McDonald study indicates that any improvement seen persists for at least&#xD;
      three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to expand on the work by McDonald et al. The study will be a randomised,&#xD;
      parallel group study comparing Omnigen treatment applied with an OmniLenz BCL to OmniLenz BCL&#xD;
      alone. The later treatment enables a degree of masking and for any difference to be&#xD;
      attributable to the Omnigen rather than a contact lens. This is in line with the&#xD;
      recommendations laid out be the DEWS group. Interim data and analysis will be conducted after&#xD;
      enrolment of 20 patients. Following the first week application the eye will be assessed, and&#xD;
      a further treatment applied for a further week. Therefore, the total treatment period will be&#xD;
      two weeks with follow-up assessments at one and three months. At six months patients will&#xD;
      complete an OSDI and EQ-5D assessment via email or post. The primary efficacy variability&#xD;
      will be change in OSDI score, a patient reported scoring of dry eye symptoms. A number of&#xD;
      clinical assessments of the ocular surface will also be performed as part of the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes whilst the opportunity to measure a number of exploratory measures will enable&#xD;
      further work following this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The TFOS DEWS II report redefines dry eye as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;. . . a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterised by a loss of homeostasis&#xD;
      of the tear film, and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and&#xD;
      hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play&#xD;
      etiological roles.&quot; Dry eye disease (DED) is a global problem, afflicting at least 344&#xD;
      million people worldwide, and is one of the most frequent causes of patient visits to eye&#xD;
      care practitioners. However, the epidemiology of DED continues to be a challenge due to the&#xD;
      lack of a standardised worldwide definition. The prevalence of DED, with and without&#xD;
      symptoms, ranges from 5 to 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tear hyperosmolarity, as well as inflammatory mediators, may induce DED symptoms and cause&#xD;
      damage to epithelial cells, surface microvilli, barrier function, the glycocalyx, and goblet&#xD;
      cells. Epithelial cell damage, lipid layer and blinking abnormalities, defective glycocalyx,&#xD;
      loss of gel mucin and reduction in tear volume may result in loss of lubrication between the&#xD;
      globe and eyelids, resulting in increased friction and also symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation of the ocular surface can cause inhibition of lacrimal secretion and loss of&#xD;
      epithelial barrier function at the ocular surface. Tear film breakup, leading to localised&#xD;
      hyperosmolarity, can result in ocular surface damage either directly or through the cascade&#xD;
      of inflammation that it initiates. Improved understanding of the role of subclinical&#xD;
      inflammation in the early stages of DED also warrants further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amniotic membrane (AM) has been utilised for many years as an adjuvant for tissue healing,&#xD;
      with the first recorded use by Davis in 1910 during skin transplantation and in the 1930s by&#xD;
      Sorsby for chemical injuries to the eye. Transplantation of human amniotic membrane has since&#xD;
      been used for many ophthalmic indications. Reports describe its efficacy in reconstructing a&#xD;
      corneal surface severely damaged by chemical agents, promoting the healing of persistent&#xD;
      corneal epithelial defects, enhancing the success of corneal surface reconstruction surgery&#xD;
      and substituting for conjunctival autografts after excision of pterygium or removal of&#xD;
      conjunctival lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human AM has anti-bacterial, anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibroblastic&#xD;
      properties. These characteristics may play a role in the use of AM in the treatment of DED. A&#xD;
      recent study published by McDonald and colleagues in 2018 conducted in 84 patients (97 eyes)&#xD;
      receiving cryopreserved AM treatment (Prokera) in addition to prior maximal medical&#xD;
      management demonstrated an improved ocular surface along with a notable reduction of the&#xD;
      severity of the overall DEWS score up to three months post treatment. Note the DEWS score is&#xD;
      not a common assessment approach (as opposed to the OSDI score) but is indicative that&#xD;
      amniotic membrane may have a positive effect in dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omnigen is a dehydrated amniotic membrane derived from human sources and certified by the UK&#xD;
      Human Tissue Authority. It offers significant potential benefits compared to cryopreserved AM&#xD;
      such as the ability to store at room temperature and to create optimum application options&#xD;
      such as circular discs rather than squares. More importantly, Omnigen has been demonstrated&#xD;
      to preserve more of the biochemistry of AM during processing which in turn should yield&#xD;
      improved clinical outcomes. Omnigen is licenced for human application and is regulated by the&#xD;
      Human Tissue Authority (HTA). NuVision has delivered over 5,000 Omnigen treatments for&#xD;
      Ophthalmology use, without any reports of adverse events (reporting a prerequisite of the&#xD;
      HTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NuVision Biotherapies holds establishment licences under the HTA (Human Tissue Authority)&#xD;
      that monitor and ensure the services and facilities comply with Good Manufacturing Practice.&#xD;
      Many of the standard applied are above and beyond the minimum required by European/UK&#xD;
      legislation and regulation. The donated tissue is collected aseptically in NHS operating&#xD;
      theatres according to protocols approved by the HTA. These protocols include donor consent&#xD;
      and testing, quarantine and release of product for clinical use. Once collected the donated&#xD;
      tissue is processed in dedicated Grade A facilities and decontaminated using an antibiotic&#xD;
      cocktail. The individual Omnigen pieces are also cut and packaged in controlled environments&#xD;
      which are regularly assessed by the HTA. The final products are assessed through quality&#xD;
      control procedures including individual visual examination and released only to units signing&#xD;
      and applying the HTA approved tissue supply agreement. This enables full traceability from&#xD;
      donor to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During production individual Omnigen pieces are marked using a surgical pen with a logo that&#xD;
      enables clinicians to determine correct orientation of Omnigen. For use with OmniLenz BCL the&#xD;
      epithelial side of the tissue should be towards the ocular surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omnigen pieces are individually packed in flat, sterile packaging. Each pack is clearly&#xD;
      labelled according to HTA standards including individual item numbers in addition to batch&#xD;
      details. The product is not irradiated and will remain sterile until opened. Omnigen is&#xD;
      stored at room temperature which simplifies logistics. NuVision offer both advice and&#xD;
      equipment to units receiving Omnigen but many units including the trial centre hold their own&#xD;
      licences. This means they are also controlled and subject to inspection by the HTA. Enclosed&#xD;
      within the packaging are adverse event or reaction reporting forms and advice that should&#xD;
      such an event occur to telephone NuVision immediately. To date there are here are no reported&#xD;
      cases of patient harm caused by the application of Omnigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OmniLenz is a bespoke BCL designed to enable the application of Omnigen without the need for&#xD;
      either sutures or glue. OmniLenz BCL is a CE marked lens, modified from a standard lens&#xD;
      produced by Menicon, that has been used to treat millions of people world-wide. The&#xD;
      modifications are minor adjustment to the back geometry of the lens to allow OmniLenz BCL to&#xD;
      be inserted over the amnion. This development has created the clinical opportunity to treat&#xD;
      numerous clinical conditions with AM in an in-clinic environment, rather than a surgical&#xD;
      setting. It has been designed to meet the needs of patients including comfort, aesthetics and&#xD;
      transparency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 900 in-clinic, suture less, applications of Omnigen using OmniLenz BCL have been used to&#xD;
      date, predominantly for treatment of severe persistent epithelial defects and ocular&#xD;
      inflammation conditions including DED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed DOORS study aims to examine the impact of applying Omnigen in the clinic without&#xD;
      sutures, for patients suffering from moderate to severe DED. It aims in particular to examine&#xD;
      the impact on both symptoms and pathology including Quality of Life (QoL) measurements and&#xD;
      relevant clinical markers of disease progression. Of particular note is a measurement of tear&#xD;
      film osmolarity, data of which is currently lacking in most studies to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), developed by the Outcomes Research Group at Allergan&#xD;
      Inc (Irvine, Calif), is a 12-item questionnaire designed to provide a rapid assessment of the&#xD;
      symptoms of ocular irritation consistent with dry eye disease and their impact on&#xD;
      vision-related functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amniotic membrane is a human tissue and as such carries a risk of infection associated with&#xD;
      receiving human tissue. These have been reduced at least by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Careful donor selection via medical assessment by trained clinical staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infectious disease testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Omnigen is from donors who test negative for, Human immunodeficiency virus, Hepatitis B&#xD;
           virus, Hepatitis C virus, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-I), Syphilis,&#xD;
           Cytomegalovirus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aseptic retrieval from living donors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Processing in Grade A clean rooms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathogen reduction by decontamination using an antibiotic cocktail during processing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality control steps from donation through to final packaging performed by trained&#xD;
           staff In particular, the risks of the use of any human tissue, or tissue derived&#xD;
           product, must always consider the risk of prion infection. Prions are known to cause&#xD;
           variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). CJD is a rare and fatal human degenerative&#xD;
           condition which can be sporadic, inherited (familial), iatrogenic or variant. An&#xD;
           analysis of all 177 UK vCJD cases reported up to December 2013 looking for the&#xD;
           possibility of vCJD transmission through organ/tissue transplantation in the UK provided&#xD;
           no evidence of transplant-associated vCJD in the UK. Therefore, this evidence suggests&#xD;
           that previous UK factors as risk for CJD contamination are minimum to non-existent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omnigen is processed using the following antibiotics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gentamycin 200 mg/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imipenem 10 mg/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nystatin 125,000 U/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polymyxin B 10 mg/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vancomycin 2.5 µg/ml Patients with antibiotic sensitivity should be identified and&#xD;
           assessed according. Antibiotic levels in Omnigen are relatively low. When released from&#xD;
           the tissue, most will be washed from the surface of the eye by tear production and&#xD;
           blinking. However, research has shown that when drugs in tears come in contact with the&#xD;
           vascular nasal mucosa, absorption into the bloodstream can occur. The 'one off' amount&#xD;
           of antibiotic becoming systemic is unlikely to elicit and sensitivity reaction, but the&#xD;
           potential risk needs to be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human amniotic membrane lacks immunogenicity, and the cornea has immune privilege. It is safe&#xD;
      to say that over 1 million amniotic membrane transplantation procedures have been performed&#xD;
      worldwide. However, there is no reported literature evidence of amniotic membrane eliciting&#xD;
      an immune response at the ocular surface, even after repeat application from different&#xD;
      donors. Therefore, though the potential risk still needs to be considered and explained to&#xD;
      the patients, the risk of sensitivity is low. Where the patient is treated in the clinic&#xD;
      using Omnigen, applied with OmniLenz BCL, the transplant can be rapidly removed should any&#xD;
      response present itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omnigen is processed using Raffinose a common lyoprotectant used in the preservation of cells&#xD;
      and tissues, providing hypertonicity for cell desiccation. There is no reported literature&#xD;
      evidence of any cases of sensitivity to raffinose pentahydrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial design has been selected to reflect the recommendations of Design and Conduct of&#xD;
      Clinical Trials: Report of the Clinical Trials Subcommittee of the International Dry Eye&#xD;
      WorkShop (2007). This stated that &quot;the most desirable design of a clinical trial is a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo- or vehicle- controlled parallel group or&#xD;
      crossover study&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control arm has been chosen for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) The intervention being studied comprises two elements; the intended amniotic membrane&#xD;
      (Omnigen), and a modified bandage contact lens (OmniLenz BCL) which is used to hold the&#xD;
      amnion in place but may have an indirect benefit. Therefore, any change may potentially be&#xD;
      due to either element or a combination of both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) The use of bandage contact lenses is a recognised treatment approach for DED. and&#xD;
      represents an existing standard of care. OmniLenz BCL treatment alone is considered to be&#xD;
      equivalent to a bandage contact lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) OmniLenz BCL placement will be obvious to the patient. The application of an OmniLenz&#xD;
      BCL without Omnigen will enable the patient to remain masked to receiving the investigational&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
