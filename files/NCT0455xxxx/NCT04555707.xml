    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled in a single-center, open-label study of the&#xD;
      treatment of psoriasis. There will be a screening/baseline, week 4, week 16 and week 20&#xD;
      visits. Subjects will include those who have been started on commercial Otezla within the&#xD;
      last 10 days of baseline. We will add Enstilar foam QD at baseline visit for 4 weeks. Those&#xD;
      subjects who achieve clear or almost clear on PGA scale at week 4 will continue on&#xD;
      maintenance dose of Enstilar twice weekly on Mondays and Thursdays QD for the next 12 weeks&#xD;
      and they will also continue on Otezla. Subjects will continue to week 20 after stopping&#xD;
      Enstilar at week 16..&#xD;

    <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a quantitative rating score for measuring the severity of psoriatic lesions based on area coverage and plaque appearance. PASI 75 evaluates if the subject had a 75% or more reduction in their PASI score from baseline.</description>

    <measure>DLQI (dermatology life quality index) at week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a ten-question questionnaire used to measure the impact of skin disease on the quality of life of an affected person. Each question is scored on a four-point Likert scale:&#xD;
Very much = 3, A lot = 2, A little = 1, Not at all = 0, Not relevant = 0, Question unanswered = 0. The DLQI is calculated by adding the score of each question, resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. A score higher than 10 indicates that the patient's life is being severely affected by their skin disease.</description>
