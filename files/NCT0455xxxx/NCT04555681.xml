  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with gingival cicatricial pemphigoid (CP), clinical experience has shown that&#xD;
      periodontal treatment is beneficial in addition to medical treatment, because the latter does&#xD;
      not always allow optimal gingival healing. However in practice, the basic periodontal&#xD;
      treatment, combining subgingival scaling and debridement, may be insufficient especially for&#xD;
      severe forms of erosive gingivitis. Therefore, a better knowledge of the periopathogenic&#xD;
      flora in such patients would facilitate the implementation of a more appropriate and&#xD;
      efficient periodontal therapy. In order to meet this objective, we propose a qualitative&#xD;
      analysis of the periodontal microbiota in case of gingival CP via a bi-centric observational&#xD;
      microbiological pilot study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In gingival cicatricial pemphigoid (PC) patients, clinical experience has shown that&#xD;
      periodontal treatment is beneficial in addition to medical treatment, because the latter does&#xD;
      not always allow optimal gingival healing. When the tissue remains erosive despite the&#xD;
      systemic treatment, and/or local, anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive, patients&#xD;
      frequently report persistent oral discomfort that restricts their diet as well as&#xD;
      difficulties in brushing their teeth. Accumulation of dental plaque, organized in bacterial&#xD;
      biofilms, therefore becomes inavoidable. However, due to their increasing development,&#xD;
      studies have revealed that this dysbiotic periodontal microbiota promotes the growth of&#xD;
      virulent, anaerobic, proteolytic bacteria, with high invasive and deleterious properties for&#xD;
      periodontal tissues. Furthermore, this process would be amplified in the presence of gingival&#xD;
      erosive zones. By eliminating the infectious periodontal gateway, periodontal therapy should&#xD;
      allow : i/to restore oral comfort ii/ to prevent any systemic oral infectious complications&#xD;
      that may affect the general condition of patients or counteract the effects of drug therapies&#xD;
      iii/ to limit the aggravation of concomitant periodontal diseases, and therefore the risk of&#xD;
      tooth loss. However in practice, the basic periodontal treatment, combining subgingival&#xD;
      scaling and debridement does not systematically meet these objectives. One explanation may be&#xD;
      found in the quality of dental bacterial biofilms not yet determined for autoimmune bullous&#xD;
      diseases. The main objective of our descriptive observational pilot study, was therefore to&#xD;
      study the composition of the periopathogenic flora in patients with gingival CP in order to&#xD;
      facilitate the implementation of a more appropriate and efficient periodontal therapy. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives were to establish a potential correlation between the composition of&#xD;
      this flora and the quality of oral life, the severity of the erosive gingival damage, whether&#xD;
      or not to initiate medical treatment, and whether or not there is an underlying&#xD;
      periodontitis.&#xD;
