      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcification of the aortic valve affects more than 26% of adult patients over 65 years of&#xD;
      age and is the main indication for valve replacement in the United States of America.&#xD;
      Previous evidence shows that aortic valve calcification is an active biological process&#xD;
      associated with inflammation. The only actual treatment for severe aortic stenosis is&#xD;
      surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). The materials with which the different types of&#xD;
      prostheses are manufactured could induce inflammation per se. Biological prostheses, an&#xD;
      incomplete cell removal process and therefore, the presence of residual proteins of animal&#xD;
      origin, could induce the immune system's response. In the manufacturing bioprosthesis at the&#xD;
      &quot;Ignacio Chávez&quot; National Institute of Cardiology (INC), an evaluation was carried out in the&#xD;
      early, and late post-surgical period, it was shown that the inflammatory response after six&#xD;
      months is similar to that produced by mechanical prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's main objective is to evaluate the inflammatory response in patients with&#xD;
      post-operated AVR due to biological or mechanical prosthetic valve through different plasma&#xD;
      biomarkers in long-term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the inflammatory response and calcification in patients who undergo aortic valve&#xD;
      replacement for a manufactured prosthesis at the &quot;Ignacio Chávez&quot; National Institute of&#xD;
      Cardiology in the long-term follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manufactured bioprostheses at the &quot;Ignacio Chávez&quot; National Institute of Cardiology show a&#xD;
      similar or lower inflammatory response to imported bioprostheses or mechanical prostheses&#xD;
      associated with less valve dysfunction and more outstanding durability.&#xD;

      Evaluation of the inflammatory response and long-term calcification in post-operated aortic&#xD;
      valve replacement patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcification of the aortic valve affects more than 26% of adult patients over 65 years of&#xD;
      age and is the main indication for valve replacement in the United States of America. In&#xD;
      Mexico, there is no exact figure for the prevalence and incidence of aortic stenosis.&#xD;
      Previous evidence shows that aortic valve calcification is an active biological process,&#xD;
      associated with inflammation and increased levels of intracellular adhesion molecule 1&#xD;
      (ICAM-1), pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin&#xD;
      6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 17 (IL-17), interleukin 18 (IL-18), extracellular&#xD;
      matrix proteins (MMP-1), tenascin-C7, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein followed by&#xD;
      osteogenic differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoprotegerin (OPG) / RANK / RANK ligand also plays a regulatory role in bone metabolism;&#xD;
      however, in bioprostheses, the role they play in dysfunction does not seem to be clear. They&#xD;
      have been found in patients with early coronary atherosclerosis, and a significant increase&#xD;
      in endothelial progenitor cells with osteoblasts, osteocalcin (OCN) and phenotype (EPN-OCN)&#xD;
      and it has been shown that it is an important prognostic marker in valvular calcification. In&#xD;
      the final stage of the disease, expression of TGFβ1 and VAP-1 has been found; both genes are&#xD;
      triggers of the calcification process without any association with osteogenic transformation,&#xD;
      which is not influenced by statins' use; however, first use alters its expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only actual treatment for severe aortic stenosis is surgical aortic valve replacement&#xD;
      (AVR). However, even after the procedure, the inflammatory response persists in almost half&#xD;
      of the patients. It has been shown that there is no correlation between age, gender, smoking,&#xD;
      ventricular geometry, transvalvular aortic gradient, and the persistence of the inflammatory&#xD;
      state after valve replacement. Even more, the materials with which the different types of&#xD;
      prostheses are manufactured could induce inflammation per se. Biological prostheses, an&#xD;
      incomplete cell removal process and therefore the presence of residual proteins of animal&#xD;
      origin, could induce a response of the immune system through the xenoantigen Gal-3-Gal- and&#xD;
      its corresponding anti-Gal antibodies that have been associated with valve prosthetic damage.&#xD;
      The presence of metallic components such as titanium could act as a trigger for the&#xD;
      inflammatory response. As regards the hemodynamic profile of the bioprosthesis, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether it is correlated with an inflammatory response. In the manufacturing bioprosthesis at&#xD;
      the &quot;Ignacio Chávez&quot; National Institute of Cardiology (INC), an evaluation was carried out in&#xD;
      the early, and late post-surgical period, it was shown that the inflammatory response after&#xD;
      six months is similar to that produced by mechanical prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's main objective is to evaluate the inflammatory response in patients with&#xD;
      post-operated AVR due to biological or mechanical prosthetic valve through different plasma&#xD;
      biomarkers in long-term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem Statement&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pattern of the inflammatory response and long-term calcification of the prosthetic valve&#xD;
      manufactured in the National Institute of Cardiology &quot;Ignacio Chávez&quot; is not known, in the&#xD;
      study carried out by Soto López and Cols in which patients undergoing prosthetic valve change&#xD;
      were evaluated in a state of early and late post-surgical (6 months) it was observed that&#xD;
      there is no difference between biological or mechanical prosthesis. We believe that the&#xD;
      inflammatory process associated with the INC bioprosthesis persists over time. However, it&#xD;
      could be even less than an imported bioprosthesis or mechanical prosthesis, so it is&#xD;
      necessary to evaluate its inflammatory pattern in long-term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degenerative aortic stenosis is a significant health problem, and its treatment through valve&#xD;
      replacement modifies morbidity and mortality. There are currently more than 5000 prostheses&#xD;
      implanted in the INC, and the leading cause of dysfunction is calcification. The long-term&#xD;
      inflammatory response in INC bioprostheses has not been evaluated to date, identifying, and&#xD;
      comparing the inflammatory pattern between these bioprostheses could identify potential&#xD;
      therapeutic targets. Demonstrating non-inferiority and a similar or less inflammatory pattern&#xD;
      could provide one more reason to start its generalized use in public health institutions in&#xD;
      the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the inflammatory response and calcification in patients who undergo aortic valve&#xD;
      replacement for a manufactured prosthesis at the &quot;Ignacio Chávez&quot; National Institute of&#xD;
      Cardiology in the long-term follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Quantify the long-term inflammatory response of INC bioprostheses implanted in the aortic&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the long-term inflammatory response of INC bioprostheses implanted in the aortic&#xD;
           position to imported bioprostheses and mechanical prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inflammatory response of post-bioprosthesis operated patients will be compared with&#xD;
           a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory response is more significant in manufactured bioprostheses at the &quot;Ignacio&#xD;
      Chávez&quot; National Institute of Cardiology, associated with more significant prosthetic valve&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manufactured bioprostheses at the &quot;Ignacio Chávez&quot; National Institute of Cardiology show a&#xD;
      similar or lower inflammatory response to imported bioprostheses or mechanical prostheses,&#xD;
      which is associated with less valve dysfunction and more outstanding durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design type&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational, longitudinal, descriptive ambispective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 56 patients (14 patients per group) was calculated using a test for&#xD;
      difference of independent proportions, with a power of 80 %, probability of error of 0.5,&#xD;
      based on the RANK concentration from the previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normality of continuous variables will be sought with the Shapiro Wilks test. According&#xD;
      to the distribution, continuous variables will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation or&#xD;
      median and interquartile ranges. The categorical variables will be expressed in number and&#xD;
      percentage. Comparisons will be made using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for&#xD;
      categorical variables; For dimensional variables, the Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney's U&#xD;
      test will be used. The differences will be considered statistically significant when the&#xD;
      value of p is less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparation of the protocol and review by the ethics committee will be carried out in the&#xD;
      months of June to August 2017, the obtaining of the information will take place from August&#xD;
      2017 to February 2018, the obtaining of the inflammatory profile will be carried out in the&#xD;
      months of March 2018 to July 2019, the information processing will take place in August and&#xD;
      December 2019, the review by the committee will be enhanced in January to July 2020 and the&#xD;
