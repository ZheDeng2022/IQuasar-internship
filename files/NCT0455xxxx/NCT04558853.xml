  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a lethal disease and at present no available treatment method seems&#xD;
      to prevent the disease from progressing or relapsing in the long term. NK cells have a&#xD;
      relatively high cytotoxic capacity and an anti tumour effect, suggesting a potential as a&#xD;
      treatment of MM.This is a phase I, first-in-human, therapeutic exploratory study, where no&#xD;
      benefits for the patients can be guaranteed. However, the theoretical implication is that the&#xD;
      infused cells may have a positive antitumour effect for the participating individuals.&#xD;

    <description>The investigation product is a cell suspension based on ex vivo expanded NK cells from patients with MM. The treatment is strictly autologous. The IP is given as three infusions with escalating doses.&#xD;
Mode of administration Intravenous infusions. Dose levels&#xD;
First infusion; 5x10^6 cells/kg body weight&#xD;
Second infusion; 50x10^6 cells/kg body weight&#xD;
Third infusion; 100x10^6 cells/kg body weight</description>
