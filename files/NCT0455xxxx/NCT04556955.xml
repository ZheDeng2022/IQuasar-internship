      The aim of this research is to compare the effects of post isometric relaxation and graston&#xD;
      technique in mechanical neck pain. Post isometric relaxation and graston effects on pain ,&#xD;
      cervical range of motion and function. A randomized controlled trial was done at Max health&#xD;
      hospital G-8 markaz Islamabad . The sample size was 20. The Participants were divided into&#xD;
      two groups,10 participants in group A (post iso metric relaxation) and 10 in group B (Graston&#xD;
      technique ) . The study duration was 6 months. Sampling technique applied was purposive&#xD;
      sampling technique Randomized through sealed enveloped method . Only 18 to 50 years&#xD;
      participants with mechanical neck pain were included in the study . Outcome measure Tools&#xD;
      used in this study were Numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) ,inclinometer for cervical ROM,&#xD;
      Algometer for pain pressure threshold and Neck disability index for assessing functional&#xD;
      disability . Data analyzed through SPSS version 20.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among all Musculoskeletal disorders occuring in general population ,the neck pain is one of&#xD;
      the most common disorder. It's prevalence ranges from 14.2% to 71% in the general population&#xD;
      and more prevalent in adult women With the adult age of 15-74 years it's mean point&#xD;
      prevalence becomes 7.6%. The child's et al concluded that the life time prevalence of neck&#xD;
      pain is 22-70% Among computer workers it has been observed higher incidence , the studies&#xD;
      predicted one year incidence of neck pain from 10.4% to 21.3%. Neck pain is defined as &quot;the&#xD;
      pain anywhere within the region bounded superiorly by superior nuchal line, inferiorly by an&#xD;
      imaginary line through the tip of first thoracic spinous process and laterally by sagittal&#xD;
      plane tangential to the lateral borders of the neck&quot;..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postural and mechanical based symptoms occurs in Mechanical neck pain that are under the&#xD;
      influence of many factors that's why difficult to understand.The evidence of studies suggests&#xD;
      prolonged adapted posture and repetitive movements falls under the category of biomechanical&#xD;
      factors that introduce neck pain whereas according to psychosocial stress associated with&#xD;
      neck pain , in which over activity of trapezius muscle motor units monitored , due to&#xD;
      increased mental and physical demand of work . That Results in Muscle spasm and pain ,&#xD;
      majorly caused by long time exposure to these stressors which can lead to functional&#xD;
      disability , reduces activity level , anxiety , depression overall influence the quality of&#xD;
      life of individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence supported by studies that , in subjects with mechanical neck pain may have trigger&#xD;
      points in cervical muscles that include upper trapezius , levator scapulae and&#xD;
      sternocleidomastoid muscles . When palpated elicited referred pain pattern , so responsible&#xD;
      for major provoked symptoms of Mechanical neck pain. In the cervical region the upper&#xD;
      trapezius , levator scapulae , scalene and sternocleidomastoid muscles are tend to be more&#xD;
      tight and painful thus their lengthening is more prioritized. Along with the upper trapezius&#xD;
      is considered as the most commonly involved muscle. The trigger points are defined as the&#xD;
      taut bands of skeletal muscle tissues in hypersensitive areas that generates pain on&#xD;
      palpation and shows tenderness on touch. In individual with Mechanical neck pain , the pain&#xD;
      processes may involve muscular trigger points. According to shah et al it has been shown that&#xD;
      Mechanical Neck Pain is associated with sensitization mechanisms, the algogenic substances&#xD;
      and chemical mediators (potassium , serotonin, bradykinin ,histamine , prostaglandins and&#xD;
      leukotrienes) that involved in tissue damage can also lead to peripheral transduction are&#xD;
      present in higher level in active trigger points than latent trigger points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature Review :A Systemic review or Meta-analysis in 2017 by including 7 studies after&#xD;
      screening 1169 articles to determine the impact of manual therapy and exercise therapy as&#xD;
      combined treatment or delivered alone for the treatment of neck pain patients. They concluded&#xD;
      that combined treatment were no more effective for improving outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2018 done a metaanalysis conducted to determine the effects of thoracic manipulation on&#xD;
      pain and disability in patients of chronic mechanical neck pain . The results describes that&#xD;
      thrust manipulation was highly effective than non thrust manipulation for reducing pain and&#xD;
      disability associated with mechanical neck pain patients In 2019 a systemic review of 47&#xD;
      randomized controlled trails studies conducted about treatment of chronic non specific neck&#xD;
      pain majorly focused on efficacy , effectiveness and safety of manipulation , mobilization&#xD;
      and multi-modal approaches.They also predicted that multi-modal approach may have more impact&#xD;
      in decreasing pain and increasing function in patients with non specific neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study Results suggested that Adding Post isometric relaxation technique to the&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy treatment program of chronic Mechanical Neck Pain was more&#xD;
      effective in reducing pain and functional disability and increasing cervical ROM than the&#xD;
      traditional treatment program alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study in 2016 suggested that for Muscle energy technique reduces the pain and functional&#xD;
      disability higher than stretching technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study suggested that for reducing pain and increasing Range of motion Muscle energy&#xD;
      technique was better than static stretching in treating patients with mechanical neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to an Randomized controlled trail study that compared the efficacy of spinal&#xD;
      manipulative therapy and Graston technique for the treatment of non specific thoracic&#xD;
      pain.There is no significant difference in outcome at any point for pain or disability when&#xD;
      comparing Spinal manipulative Therapy , Graston Technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to an RCT , the Post Isometric Relaxation was highly beneficial for improving&#xD;
      cervical ROM and reducing pain , associated disability in non specific neck pain patients&#xD;
      then isometric exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to comparative study in 2017, results suggested increase in neck mobility and&#xD;
      reduction in pain , but concluded that Muscle energy technique was more beneficial than&#xD;
      positional release technique in patient's with non-specific neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016 According to a study in patients with chronic mechanical neck pain .The outcome&#xD;
      measure tools was Visual Analogue Scale for pain intensity , universal goniometer used to&#xD;
      measure rotation and lateral flexion of neck muscles while function was determined by Neck&#xD;
      Disability Index scale. Results showed improvement in both Proprioceptive Neuromuscular&#xD;
      facilitation and Muscle Energy Technique .&#xD;
