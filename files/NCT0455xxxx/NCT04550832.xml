      This trial is to describe the safety, tolerability and exposure-toxicity relationship of&#xD;
      Depazolid given over 16 weeks, in combination with standard-dose Bedaquiline, Delamanid and&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin, compared to standard-dose Bedaquiline, Delamanid and Moxifloxacin alone&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label Phase IIb dose-finding, randomized, controlled study with a&#xD;
      duration of 16 weeks of experimental therapy of Delpazolid(DZD) - Bedaquiline/Delamanid/&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin (BDM) in adult patients with newly diagnosed, smear positive, uncomplicated,&#xD;
      drug sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) to evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and exposure/response-relationship of different doses of delpazolid in&#xD;
      combination with bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of five arms containing BDM standard dose with&#xD;

             period of taking study medication (See Appendix, section 20.2, page 92).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The participant is either unable to conceive/father children AND/OR his/her partner is&#xD;
             unable to conceive/father children AND/OR they will consent to be using effective&#xD;

             a. Non-childbearing potential: i. Female participant/sexual partner of male&#xD;
             participant: Bilateral oophorectomy, and/or hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation&#xD;
