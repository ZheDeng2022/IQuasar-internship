    <textblock>
      This single-center, clinical trial is being conducted to determine whether non-narcotic pain&#xD;
      regiments are as effective as narcotic-based regiments in reducing post-operative pain in&#xD;
      patients undergoing breast reduction in the outpatient setting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-blinded, non-inferiority, randomized control trial with the primary outcome of&#xD;
      interest being overall pain, with secondary outcomes including adverse effects from pain&#xD;
      medications, patient satisfaction with their pain regiment and with their surgery, and the&#xD;
      impact of pain on their daily activities. This study is designed to follow one-hundred (100)&#xD;
      qualified and consenting patients seeing the PI/surgeon (JMK) at his office at UT&#xD;
      Southwestern for their initial operative consultation for macromastia. If patients meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, they will be offered enrollment in the trial.&#xD;

    <description>ERAS Arm will undergo multimodal regiment:&#xD;
Before Surgery- gabepentin 300mg and celecoxib 400mg once the day before surgery and again 3 hours prior to surgery.&#xD;
During surgery- subjects will receive ketorolac 30mg IV ketorolac once (15mg for patients age 64 years and above).&#xD;
Post-operatively- Gabapentin 100mg three times daily for POD0-7, ketorolac 10mg four times daily for POD1-5 days, and ondansetron 4mg as needed for nausea; patients will also have a prescription for hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5/325mg tabs that they may fill if needed for emergency/breakthrough pain.</description>
