  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The desire to reduce complications related to percutaneous access and morbidity related to&#xD;
      tract size has led researchers to evaluate PCNL using smaller-caliber instruments. In this&#xD;
      context, mini-PCNL has emerged. Its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated at the cost of&#xD;
      a lower stone-free rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of existing Ho: YAG lasers is limited by the need for manual removal of&#xD;
      stone fragments and mobilization of them due to the lack of a simultaneous aspiration system.&#xD;
      Consequently, this has been associated with long surgical times to achieve stone-free status.&#xD;
      This requires multiple insertions and extractions of the nephroscope to facilitate the&#xD;
      recovery of all fragments. This repeated step can cause the safety rails to be inadvertently&#xD;
      removed or the sheaths to be disinserted. Sometimes compromising surgical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faced with this situation, the search for better and more efficient energy sources still&#xD;
      continues. With this, modern lithotripters have emerged that combine energy sources and work&#xD;
      more efficiently than any of them independently and, consequently, improve stone removal.&#xD;
      Cyberwand ™ (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), Swiss Lithoclast® Master / Select (EMS SA, Switzerland /&#xD;
      Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) and Shockpulse-SE ™ (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) are some&#xD;
      examples; although they have their own set of advantages, none have proven to be superior to&#xD;
      any other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously discussed, ballistic-ultrasonic lithotripsy combines ultrasonic and ballistic&#xD;
      energy together with a suction system with encouraging results in terms of a shorter&#xD;
      lithotripsy time and the respective economic impact of fewer surgical events and less&#xD;
      operating time required for the stone removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is convenient to make a comparison between the results of lithotripsy with Ho:&#xD;
      YAG laser energy and lithotripsy with LithoClast Trilogy EMS; and thereby determine which is&#xD;
      the most effective method in the resolution of kidney stones through a miniaturized&#xD;
      percutaneous tract.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background The tools used for fragmentation and stone extraction have been improving over&#xD;
      time. Commonly available lithotripsy power sources are classified as ultrasonic, kinetic,&#xD;
      electrohydraulic, or combination, however, laser is the most widely used lithotripsy device&#xD;
      in mini-PCNL as it is a small diameter power source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser lithotripsy The holmium laser has been very effective in the fragmentation of stones of&#xD;
      variable hardness and very safe due to its low depth of penetration (0.5 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the advantages of the Ho: YAG laser is that it offers relatively quick lithotripsy&#xD;
      while minimizing tissue trauma. Furthermore, it is effective against all stone compositions,&#xD;
      including cystine and calcium oxalate monohydrate, where ultrasonic lithotripsy may have&#xD;
      difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The removal of smaller fragments is possible using a vacuum effect where the fragments are&#xD;
      moved from a high pressure zone in the pyelocaliceal system to a lower pressure zone in the&#xD;
      sheath. If there are too many fragments, this requires multiple insertions and extractions of&#xD;
      the nephroscope to facilitate the recovery of all of them. This repeated step can cause&#xD;
      inadvertent movements that affect the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined ballistic-ultrasonic lithotripsy LithoClast Trilogy EMS is the newest model of&#xD;
      percutaneous lithotripsy technology that provides electromagnetic and ultrasonic ballistic&#xD;
      energy, as well as suction capacity under the control of the surgeon through a single pedal.&#xD;
      Laboratory studies have suggested that combined ballistic-ultrasonic lithotripsy offers&#xD;
      faster stone clearance than other combined and ultrasonic devices. In an in vitro comparison,&#xD;
      LithoClast Trilogy EMS had the fastest average removal time of 23.79 seconds. This was&#xD;
      followed by ShockPulse (46.04 seconds), Select-US (54.86 seconds), and Select-USP (102.48&#xD;
      seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multi-institutional study, LithoClast Trilogy EMS was evaluated, the experience of&#xD;
      surgeons with this device was perceived as highly satisfactory, with an excellent safety and&#xD;
      durability profile. The average stone removal rate was 68.9 mm2 / minute. High tissue safety&#xD;
      and an optimized aspiration configuration were reported in a prospective clinical trial. In&#xD;
      this study, the mean stone volume clearance ratios were 370.5 ± 171 mm3 / min and 590.7 ± 250&#xD;
      mm3 / min for mini-PCNL and PCNL, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LithoClast Trilogy EMS has a single probe design and connects to the handpiece and oscillates&#xD;
      with a piezoelectric ultrasonic generator at a rate of 24 kHz. At the same time, an&#xD;
      electromagnetic generator produces ballistic motion of the entire probe at an adjustable&#xD;
      speed of up to 12 Hz. As with other ultrasound-based devices, suction is available through&#xD;
      the hollow probe, with the foot pedal controlling the aspiration and activation of&#xD;
      lithotripsy. The strength of the ultrasonic vibration, the aspiration and the ballistic&#xD;
      energy discharge frequency are adjustable through a touch screen on the generator. Various&#xD;
      probe sizes are available (3.3 F, 4.5 F, 5.7 F, 10.2 F, and 11.7 F catheter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION The desire to reduce complications related to percutaneous access and morbidity&#xD;
      related to tract size has led researchers to evaluate PCNL using smaller-caliber instruments.&#xD;
      In this context, mini-PCNL has emerged. Its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated at the&#xD;
      cost of a lower stone-free rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of existing Ho: YAG lasers is limited by the need for manual removal of&#xD;

      PROBLEM STATEMENT What is the difference of the lithotripsy rate with LithoClast Trilogy EMS&#xD;
      compared to 100 W Holmium laser for patients with kidney stones GUY's 1 and 2 in percutaneous&#xD;
      mini nephrolithotomy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS H0: Lithotripsy performed with LithoClast Trilogy EMS in patients with GUY's 1 and&#xD;
      2 kidney stones undergoing percutaneous mini nephrolithotomy has a higher lithotripsy rate&#xD;
      than that performed with a 100W Holmium laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hi: Lithotripsy performed with LithoClast Trilogy EMS in patients with GUY's 1 and 2 kidney&#xD;
      stones undergoing percutaneous mini nephrolithotomy has a lower lithotripsy rate than that&#xD;
      performed with a 100W Holmium laser.&#xD;
