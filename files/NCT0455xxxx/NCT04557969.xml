    <textblock>
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To follow people with GISTs and collect tumor tissue so that it can be studied in the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 6 and older who have a GIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records and samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will enroll in 1 other NIH study, and may be asked to enroll in 2 other optional&#xD;
      NIH studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history and physical exam. Data about how they function in&#xD;
      their daily activities will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may speak with a genetic counselor. They may have genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood samples. They may have a cheek swab. For this, small brush will&#xD;
      be rubbed against the inside of the cheek.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Or&#xD;
      they may have a CT scan of the chest and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and&#xD;
      pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored every 6-12 months at the NIH Clinical Center, for up to 10&#xD;
      years before having surgery. If they need surgery, it will be performed at the NIH. Then,&#xD;
      they will be monitored every 6-12 months, for up to 5 years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant has surgery, tumor tissue samples will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant does not need surgery, their participation will end after 10 years. If they&#xD;
      have surgery, the 5-year monitoring period will restart after each surgery.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common gastrointestinal soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma, but remain a rare disease entity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most GISTs are characterized by KIT or PDGFRA mutations, making them susceptible to tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wild-type (WT) GISTs are rarer tumors, usually characterized by SDH mutations and/or lack of&#xD;
      KIT or PDGFRA mutations; paragangliomas are frequently associated with WT GISTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-WT GISTs may become refractory to TKI therapy, whereas WT GISTs are generally resistant&#xD;
      to TKI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary treatment modality for GISTs is surgical resection, which may involve the&#xD;
      stomach, liver, and/or peritoneal surfaces; most patients will require multiple operations to&#xD;
      remove disease not responsive to systemic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational systemic therapies are limited by toxicity and/or lack of efficacy, resulting&#xD;
      in an unmet need for novel treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining fresh tumor tissue is critical to the successful development of GIST models for&#xD;
      drug research, as well as for next generation tumor genomic sequencing, and to help identify&#xD;
      novel targets and/or agents for the treatment of WT and TKI-resistant non-WT GISTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate and follow patients with GISTs, particularly WT and treatment-refractory non-WT, to&#xD;
      support translational research for this rare disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess disease-free intervals (DFIs) between surgical resection of disease for at least 5&#xD;
      years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically confirmed or clinical presentation suspicious of GIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically confirmed or clinical presentation suspicious of GIST will&#xD;
      enroll on study and will have active surveillance every 6 months for up to 10 years prior to&#xD;
      and up to 5 years after surgical resection and/or cytoreduction. As patients may have&#xD;
      multiple resections during the course of the study, 5-year surveillance post-surgery may be&#xD;
      initiated multiple times, relative to the last resection performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled will be evaluated for tumor resection or cytoreduction at the start of&#xD;
      study and if appropriate, will be offered surgery, otherwise they will be on active&#xD;
      surveillance until surgical resection or cytoreduction is clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that approximately 30-40 patients per year may enroll on this trial; the&#xD;
      accrual ceiling will be set at 400 to permit accrual over a 10-year period.&#xD;
