  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular therapy (EVT) was recommended as the primary treatment for patients with acute&#xD;
      large vascular occlusion (LVO) in anterior circulation. However, the evidences of EVT for&#xD;
      patients with large infarct volume were limited. In this study, the investigators assume that&#xD;
      best medical management plus EVT might be superior than best medical management alone for&#xD;
      patients who have evidence of a large infarct volume. The primary objective of the study was&#xD;
      to establish the safety and efficacy of EVT in patients presenting with symptoms of acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke (AIS) from LVO in the anterior circulation and having a large infarct volume.&#xD;

      The ANGEL-ASPECT is a multicentered, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point&#xD;
      (PROBE) study. A total of approximately 488 patients (age from 18 to 80 years) within 24&#xD;
      hours of symptom onset of acute ischemic stroke, who has the imaging evidence of an occlusion&#xD;
      of the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) terminus and/or Middle Cerebral Artery Main Stem (MCA&#xD;
      M1) segment, large infarct core [ defined as: 1) NCCT (noncontrast computed tomography)&#xD;
      ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) 3-5, decided on last head CT scan before&#xD;
      randomization. 2) Ischemic core volume ranges from 70-100ml, determined either on a&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted MRI map based on an ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) threshold of less&#xD;
      than 620 ×10-6mm2/s or on CTP (computed tomography perfusion) image with rCBF&lt;30%] will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content. One group&#xD;
      will receive best medical management alone the other group will receive best medical&#xD;
      management plus EVT including mechanical thrombectomy, aspiration thrombectomy,&#xD;
      intra-arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty or stenting. The primary objective is to establish&#xD;
      the efficacy of EVT in patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) from&#xD;
      LVO in the anterior circulation and having a large infarct volume. The study consists of six&#xD;
      visits including the day of randomization, 2 days after randomization, 7 days or discharge,&#xD;
      and 30, 90 days and 1 year. Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test,&#xD;
      neuro-imaging assessment neurological function rating scale will be recorded during the&#xD;
      program. The primary endpoint is the modified Rankin's scale (mRS) at 90 days. The trial is&#xD;
      anticipated to last from September 2020 to October 2022 with 488 subjects recruited form&#xD;
      about 50 centers in China. All the related investigative organization and individuals will&#xD;
      obey the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese Good Clinical Practice standard. A Data and&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has&#xD;
      been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee (EC) in Being Tiantan&#xD;
      hospital, Capital Medical University.&#xD;

    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale runs from 0-6 with &quot;0&quot; being perfect health without symptoms to &quot;6&quot; being death.&#xD;
Score 0: No symptoms Score 1: No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.&#xD;
Score 2: Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.&#xD;
Score 3: Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted. Score 4: Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.&#xD;
Score 5: Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.&#xD;
