    <textblock>
      In the study, subjects will scheduled to undergo four 21-days cycles of chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. Three group were treated with MW05 300 μg/kg or MW05 500 μg/kg or PEG-rhG-CSF 100&#xD;
      μg/kg on the 3th day of each cycle randomized 1:1:1 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of the experimental drug MW05 in phase III were determined by independent data&#xD;
      monitoring committee (IDMC) according to the efficacy and safety of phase II. Subjects were&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups 1:1 to received either MW05 or PEG-rhG-CSF(100 μg/kg) on the&#xD;
      3th day of each chemotherapy cycle.&#xD;
