  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a significant cause of death and disability in France and internationally. The&#xD;
      incidence of stroke increases with age, equal for both sexes. Of all strokes, 50% of cases&#xD;
      occur in patients over 75 years of age. This advanced age leads to a high risk of mortality,&#xD;
      long hospitalization, causing neurological sequelae in most cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological handicap in the elderly is due to a high rate of comorbidity, reduced neuronal&#xD;
      plasticity, nutritional status, and the short time to convert the penumbra area to ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the standard treatment for the acute phase of HF is thrombolysis or thrombectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle of thrombolysis is based on the use of a thrombolytic drug (ActyliseÂ®). It is a&#xD;
      tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) that will cause lysis and dissolution of clots blocking&#xD;
      the artery. Thrombolysis is recommended until 4:30 a.m. after the onset of symptoms in the&#xD;
      absence of contraindication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical thrombectomy consists of removing the blood clot by introducing a probe into the&#xD;
      artery having a proximal carotid or sylvic occlusion in its M1 portion or in the&#xD;
      vertebro-basilar territory of an indeterminate schedule of less than 24 hours or determined&#xD;
      from 6 hours to 24 hours having a radio-clinical mismatch, according to the DAWN study. The&#xD;
      results of this study were analyzed according to age, NIHSS score and lesion volume on&#xD;
      perfusion scanner or MRI (RAPID software). The interim analysis at 31 months on 206&#xD;
      randomized patients (107 thrombectomies versus 99 medical treatments alone) showed a clear&#xD;
      superiority of the thrombectomy, leading to the premature end of the study, over the handicap&#xD;
      at 3 months with more than 35 % of independent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most of the randomized studies, patients over 90 years of age have been excluded or are&#xD;
      under-represented. This lack of data therefore does not make it possible to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of thrombolysis or thrombectomy treatments in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent meta-analysis has shown that the functional recovery in these patients treated by&#xD;
      thrombectomy is superior to those of the same age without thrombectomies. According to&#xD;
      American studies, the advanced age of a patient is not a contraindication to this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients affected by a cerebral infarction represent 40 to 50% of hospitalizations in the&#xD;
      neurology department of the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph. In the intensive care of&#xD;
      the neuro-vascular unit, the patient is received as quickly as possible to decide whether he&#xD;
      can benefit from an extreme emergency treatment (intravenous thrombolysis or thrombectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study should show that the clinical course after treatment in patients over 90&#xD;
      years of age is substantially comparable to younger patients, and that age is not a&#xD;
      contraindication to treatment in the acute phase of stroke in the elderly.&#xD;
