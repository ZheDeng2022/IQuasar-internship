  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, clinical trial consists of a one autologous fat grafting treatment&#xD;
      followed by 3-month and 6-month post-treatment visits in order to assess the efficacy of fat&#xD;
      grafting when used by men and women with facial acne scars.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigation, pilot study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous fat&#xD;
      grafting for the treatment of acne scarring. Overall assessment of clinical outcome and&#xD;
      safety will be based clinic visits and evaluation of pre- and post- procedural photos. In&#xD;
      conjunction with standard and close-up photography, we will also be using 3D imaging,&#xD;
      cross-polarized imaging, UV imaging, high-resolution ultrasonography, optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography, transepidermal water loss measurements, and/or BTC 2000 measurements.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will be utilizing 0.33 mm skin biopsies to assess histological and genetic&#xD;
      changes that occur below the skin surface as a result of this treatment. The subject's&#xD;
      assessment of satisfaction will be characterized using a non-parametric assessment scale at&#xD;
      each follow-up period.&#xD;
