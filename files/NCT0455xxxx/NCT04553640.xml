  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Misdiagnosis of neurological conditions is common in healthcare settings, sometimes with&#xD;
      devastating consequences. Most diagnostic errors result from failures in bedside diagnostic&#xD;
      reasoning. Dizziness is a symptom that is common, costly, and frequently associated with&#xD;
      missed stroke. Too often healthcare providers have misconceptions about diagnostic approaches&#xD;
      to dizziness. Current systems of medical education, residency training, and licensure&#xD;
      requirements have proven insufficient to prevent harms from diagnostic error. Traditional&#xD;
      lectures do not change physician behavior but active learning strategies with the use of&#xD;
      simulation do. The investigators built and hope to expand a simulation-based curriculum to&#xD;
      improve diagnosis of dizziness (SIDD) that will mirror real-world encounters and clinical&#xD;
      practice. Using the tenets of deliberate practice with rapid, real-time feedback, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to improve the approach to dizziness of healthcare providers and correct&#xD;
      knowledge deficits that contribute to diagnostic errors. Investigators have chosen dizziness&#xD;
      as the &quot;model symptom&quot; for this study. Future plans include expanding this approach to other&#xD;
      symptoms that are also common, costly, and associated with a high misdiagnosis rate (e.g.&#xD;
      abdominal pain, dyspnea, or chest pain).&#xD;

      Diagnostic errors and resulting misdiagnosis-related harms represent a major public health&#xD;
      problem. Most diagnostic errors result from failures in bedside diagnostic reasoning. Gaps in&#xD;
      expertise (ultimately linked to faulty knowledge, inadequate training, or lack of feedback)&#xD;
      account for many of these failures. Current systems of medical education, residency training,&#xD;
      and licensure requirements have proven insufficient to prevent harms from diagnostic errors.&#xD;
      The National Academy of Medicine recommends using simulation training with early exposure to&#xD;
      a variety of typical/atypical cases to improve diagnostic performance. A systematic review&#xD;
      found strong positive associations between simulation training and improved outcomes of&#xD;
      knowledge, skills, and behaviors. Training in bedside diagnosis could be dramatically&#xD;
      enhanced through symptom-specific virtual patient (VP) curricula that expose learners to&#xD;
      real-world cases in a deliberate practice framework - practice that is motivated, purposeful,&#xD;
      and systematic. This approach allows the appropriate mix of cases and difficulty to be&#xD;
      presented to learners sequentially, potentially enhancing clinical skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical presentations with nonspecific symptoms and diagnoses with wide differentials are&#xD;
      especially prone to diagnostic errors; dizziness may be the epitome of this conundrum.&#xD;
      Dizziness is a symptom that is common, costly, and associated with missed stroke. Isolated&#xD;
      dizziness is the most common clinical context for missed stroke. Stroke is a leading cause of&#xD;
      major long-term disability in the United States and an enormous source of global disease&#xD;
      burden. It is listed as the fourth most common diagnostic errors among those reported by&#xD;
      physicians. In fact, closed-claims analyses focused on neurologic conditions found stroke as&#xD;
      the most common misdiagnosis, and more than 20% occurred in the ED. A hospital records&#xD;
      analyses indicated that deaths due to cerebrovascular events result from diagnostic error far&#xD;
      more frequently than those due to myocardial infarction. The ED is a high-risk site for&#xD;
      diagnostic errors and indiscriminate use of neuroimaging for diagnosis of dizziness is&#xD;
      neither accurate nor cost-effective. Risk stratification using symptoms and signs at the&#xD;
      bedside offer the potential to provide cost-effective reductions in misdiagnosis-related&#xD;
      harms. There is evidence to suggest that providers are currently ill-equipped and harbor&#xD;
      misconceptions about the best approach to dizzy patients. Therefore, the investigators chose&#xD;
      dizziness as the &quot;model symptom&quot; for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even at Johns Hopkins Medicine, where dizziness diagnosis has been studied extensively, this&#xD;
      remains a problem. The Center for Diagnostic Excellence group recently showed that (a) &lt;5% of&#xD;
      dizziness charts have correct documentation of standard bedside examination techniques; (b)&#xD;
      40% of patients leave the ED with a symptom-only diagnosis (at least half of whom could have&#xD;
      been correctly diagnosed and treated); and (c) 39% receive a CT (&gt;90% of which are&#xD;
      inappropriate). Emergency medicine residents overwhelmingly express the need for better&#xD;
      training in dizziness diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently demonstrated that &lt;10 hours' worth of simulation-based deliberate&#xD;
      practice training using a dizziness-focused ViPER (Virtual Patient Education from Real Cases)&#xD;
      curriculum made internal medicine interns twice as accurate as senior resident colleagues on&#xD;
      VP cases. The investigators now seek to do the same for emergency medicine residents and&#xD;
      demonstrate real-world impact.&#xD;
