      This study is designed to find out the effect of maintaining apical patency versus non&#xD;
      maintaining apical patency on post-operative pain after single visit endodontic treatment in&#xD;
      necrotic teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis&#xD;

      After taking approval from the ethical committee (AFID No 905/Trg-ABP1K2), this study is&#xD;
      planned at operative department in Armed Forces Institute of Dentistry, Rawalpindi from 01&#xD;
      June 2020 to 31 December 2020. Informed consent would be taken from 240 patients of 20-50&#xD;
      years of age from both gender with good general, mental and physical health who would be&#xD;
      selected for this study and would be randomly divided into two equal groups with the help of&#xD;
      scientific random number table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mandibular first molar teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis either with necrotic&#xD;
      pulps, without any intra-oral or extra-oral swelling or any draining sinus tract will be&#xD;
      selected for this study. Patients on preoperative analgesics and antibiotics, teeth with&#xD;
      calcified canals and open apex, previously traumatized teeth and root canal treated teeth&#xD;
      along with immune-compromised patients, pregnant and lactating mothers will be excluded from&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients reporting to the Operative Dentistry Department of Armed Forces Institute of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Rawalpindi requiring root canals of their mandibular first molar will be screened&#xD;
      for inclusion by taking history, performing relevant clinical examination and necessary&#xD;
      investigations along with peri-apical radiographs. The whole procedure of the study will be&#xD;
      explained to the patients in Urdu. After taking written informed consent from the willing&#xD;
      participants of this study the procedure will be started. Two groups will be formed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Patency group and Group B: Non-patency group Root canal treatment will be initiated&#xD;
      under local anesthesia and rubber dam isolation. Working length will be taken with apex&#xD;
      locator and will be confirmed with radiograph. The root canals will be instrumented with&#xD;
      ProTaper Next system under copious irrigation with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 17%&#xD;
      EDTA solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group A, a size 10 K file will be passed beyond the apical foramen between each instrument&#xD;
      change to maintain apical patency while in group B, K file will be carried up to the working&#xD;
      length only. A final peri-apical radiograph will be taken in the group A with the 10 K&#xD;
      patency file 01mm beyond the apical foramen to confirm patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To control the microbiological impact on post-operative pain 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and 17%&#xD;
      EDTA will be used as irrigants in both groups. Obturation will be done with cold lateral&#xD;
      condensation using Pro Taper Next GP points and permanent restoration will be done with&#xD;
      composite. At the end of this appointment patients will be given a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS), and will be advised to mark at the scale according to his pain intensity after 24&#xD;
      hours and 48 hours after the treatment and will be asked to bring these reading with him on&#xD;
      the next scheduled visit after one week for tooth preparation for metal ceramic crown.&#xD;
      Patients will be given analgesic and will be advised to take it only in case of severe pain.&#xD;
      VAS scores of less than 4 will be considered as no pain, score of 4-7 will be considered as&#xD;
      mild and/or moderate pain and scores of 8 and above will be considered as severe pain. (no&#xD;
      pain = &lt;3, moderate pain = &gt;4 to 7, severe pain = &gt; 8). Frequencies, percentages, mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation will be calculated for qualitative variable like inter appointment pain&#xD;
      and for quantitative variables like gender; mean and standard deviation along with&#xD;
      percentages in each group will be calculated with SPSS 22. Chi-square test will be used to&#xD;
      compare the frequency of pain between the two groups after 24 and 48 hours of endodontic&#xD;
      treatment. The p value of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;

    <description>To find out the incidence of post operative pain with Visual analogue scale after single visit endodontic treatment in necrotic teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis in two groups, Group A of 120 patients in which apical patency is maintained and Group B of 120 patients in which apical patency is non maintained. VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) will be used to measure pain. VAS scores of less than 4 will be considered as no pain, score of 4-7 will be considered as mild and/or moderate pain and scores of 8 and above will be considered as severe pain. (no pain = &lt;3, moderate pain = &gt;4 to 7, severe pain = &gt; 8).</description>
