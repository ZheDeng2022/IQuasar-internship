  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PBLTT52CAR19 modified T cells are allogenic engineered human T cells (defined as TT52CAR19&#xD;
      +TCRαβ-) prepared for the treatment of CD19+ B cell leukaemia. The cells are from healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteer donors and are not HLA-matched. They have been transduced to express and&#xD;
      anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19) using a lentiviral vector that also incorporates&#xD;
      CRISPR guides for genome editing of CD52 and TRAC loci in the presence of transiently&#xD;
      provided Cas9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognition by TT52CAR19 T cells mediates eradication of CD19+ leukaemia and other CD19+ B&#xD;
      cells through T cell mediated cytotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to apply PBLTT52CAR19 T cells to secure molecular remission in children with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory B-ALL ahead of programmed allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The cells&#xD;
      are to be used in a time-limited manner for their anti-leukaemia effects and then depleted by&#xD;
      standard pre- transplant conditioning.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open label, single-centre, phase I, cohort study using genome edited T cells to bring patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) into remission in anticipation of a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) that will hopefully prevent the leukaemia from returning. It involves a single infusion of allogenic T cells transduced with a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector in up to 10 subjects aged from 6 months to 18 years. The primary objective in this study is to test the safety and secondary objective will test the efficacy of this gene therapy procedure in this population.&#xD;
Patients will be enrolled following diagnosis and referral to GOSH, and will receive TT52CAR19 cells at GOSH after lymphodepleting conditioning. They will be followed on this protocol for 12 months post IMP infusion.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Follow-up period:&#xD;
For patients achieving molecular remission by day 28, allo-HSCT will be scheduled as soon as practicable. Routine transplant care for 24 months will incorporate the disease monitoring and recording of adverse events of special interest and document elimination of PBLTT52CAR19 through the transplant conditioning period.&#xD;
For patients with refractory disease at Day 56, the monitoring of adverse events of special interest, the disease outcome will be monitored monthly up to 24 months or until a palliative therapy approach is adopted.&#xD;
Assessments will be carried out after the treatment period at the following time points: 1m, 2m, 3m, 6m, and 12m, 24m&#xD;
