    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus that leads to loss of&#xD;
      vision and blindness among working age adults. During progression of DR, patients can develop&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema (DME), which is characterized by the thickening of the macula caused&#xD;
      by the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier and consequent retinal vascular&#xD;
      hyperpermeability. In 2010, the global prevalence of DR among adults with diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      aged 20-79 years was estimated to be 34.6% for any DR and 6.81% for DME. DME is the leading&#xD;
      cause of vision loss among patients with DR. It is associated with the type of diabetes, and&#xD;
      increases with the duration and severity of disease. Other significant risk factors common to&#xD;
      DR and DME include hyperglycemia and hypertension. DME negatively impacts patients'&#xD;
      health-related quality of life and represents an economic burden due to the increased use of&#xD;
      healthcare resources by affected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In DR, which is a complex multifactorial disease, basically the retinal neovascularization&#xD;
      occurs with the disturbance of physiological angiogenesis due to creation of hypoxic&#xD;
      condition, which induces the oxygen demand in the retina (Roth, 1977; Smith et al., 1994;&#xD;
      Chen and Smith, 2007). Consequently, in response to induced hypoxia, excessive production and&#xD;
      over expression of VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors take place in the retina. This&#xD;
      ultimately induces the situation so called &quot;pathological neovascularization&quot; (Aiello et al.,&#xD;
      1994; Folkman, 2006). Retinal ischemia is a common precursor to vitreal neovascularization in&#xD;
      retinal diseases (Tolentino and Adamis, 1998) and is strongly associated with a local&#xD;
      inflammatory response in the ischemic retina (Barouch et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is no curative treatment available for DME, laser photocoagulation represents an&#xD;
      effective treatment to preserve vision. However, this treatment modality is limited by its&#xD;
      inability to restore vision once it has been lost. The current standard of care for DME&#xD;
      includes intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapeutics and&#xD;
      corticosteroids. Clinical studies have confirmed that monthly intravitreal treatment with the&#xD;
      anti-VEGF treatment can improve vision, with up to 45% of patients gaining ≥ 15 letters in&#xD;
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after 24 months. Similar improvements were found after&#xD;
      treatment with the anti-VEGF antibodies. Despite the proven efficacy of VEGF inhibitors, the&#xD;
      requirement of frequent injections causes a high rate of treatment discontinuation among&#xD;
      patients with DME and represents a major limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, current pharmacological treatments target single pathogenic processes with a narrow&#xD;
      therapeutic range and may cause adverse side effects leading to undesired systemic effects.&#xD;
      The presence of potential side effects and the significant proportion of patients who do not&#xD;
      respond to treatment suggest that there remains a need for the development of improved&#xD;
      therapies for DR and DME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ideal adjunctive agent for treating DR hence should be polymorphic and possess&#xD;
      antiangiogenic, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant as well as anti-ischaemic&#xD;
      properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have assessed the efficacy of core ingredient of Nuvastatic™, Lanctos 75™ for the&#xD;
      treatment and management of the diabetic retinopathic condition. These scientific studies&#xD;
      have shown that the standardized extract of O. stamineus (Lanctos 75™) in mediates&#xD;
      antiangiogenic actions via blocking VEGF pathway. We demonstrated the potent antiangiogenic&#xD;
      activity of the standardized extract of O. stamineus and prevention activity of the extract&#xD;
      against human breast tumor in xenograft model. In addition, it is reported that, the extract&#xD;
      was found to specifically inhibit VEGF expression and VEGFR phosphorylation known to be&#xD;
      up-regulated in new blood vessel formation which in turn leads to suppression of&#xD;
      vascularization and thereby ultimately the growth of tumor will be affected. Rosmarinic acid&#xD;
      present in the extract could be involved in cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 and G1/S phases,&#xD;
      exhibiting an anti-proliferative effect of thus suggesting that the proliferative vascular&#xD;
      diseases including retinopathy might be the potential target for the pharmacological&#xD;
      application of rosmarinic acid. Also, the key active ingredients in the extract are&#xD;
      rosmarinic acid mainly, and sinensetin, eupatorin and betulinic acid, which are readily&#xD;
      absorbed into the plasma and exert that conferred the synergistic pharmacological response&#xD;
      such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic and neuroprotective effects.&#xD;
