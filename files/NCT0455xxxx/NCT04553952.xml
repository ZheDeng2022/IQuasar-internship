      this study primarily aimed to evaluate smile line distribution and prevalence of gummy smile&#xD;
      in patients. The secondary purpose was to examine parameters that might be risk factors for&#xD;
      gummy smile.Age, gender, marital status, medical history, and medication status of the&#xD;
      patients were recorded. All individuals were instructed to sit on a dental chair and the&#xD;
      measurments were made by using a millimetric ruler.Next, the patients were grouped according&#xD;
      to Liebart's classification by gingival display at maximum smile as follows: Class&#xD;
      1.Excessive gingival display (Gummy smile): ≥ 3mm gingival display Class 2.High smile line:&#xD;
      0-2 mm of gingival display Class 3. Average smile line: Dental papilla is visible. Class 4.&#xD;
      Low smile line: Gingival margin, dental papilla is not visible at all. Presence of altered&#xD;
      passive eruption, short lip and hypermobile upper lip were also evaluated.&#xD;
