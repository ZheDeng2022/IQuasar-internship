        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent(s) or guardian(s) willing and able to provide signed informed consent after the&#xD;
             nature of the study has been explained and prior to performance of any research&#xD;
             related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have ACH, documented by genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are willing and able to perform all study procedures as physically possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 0 to ≤ 12 months, at study entry (Day 1). Given that any potential impact of&#xD;
             vosoritide therapy on the foramen magnum is dependent on treating as early as possible&#xD;
             and as long as possible while the synchondroses at the base of the skull are still&#xD;
             open. For subjects &gt; 6 months of age at enrollment, a discussion between the&#xD;
             investigator and the Medical Monitor should occur with the goal of limiting the number&#xD;
             of subjects in the range of &gt; 6 months to ≤ 12 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent(s) or caregiver(s) are willing to administer daily injections to the subject&#xD;
             and complete the required training.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have evidence of CMC that &quot;may&quot; require surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have hypochondroplasia or short-stature condition other than achondroplasia (eg,&#xD;
             trisomy 21, pseudoachondroplasia, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have CMC that either does not require surgical intervention (for example foramen&#xD;
             magnum narrowing with preservation of the cerebrospinal fluid space) or does require&#xD;
             immediate surgical intervention .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any of the following: Untreated congenital hypothyroidism or maternal history of&#xD;
             hyperthyroidism, Insulin-requiring neonatal diabetes mellitus, Autoimmune inflammatory&#xD;
             disease, Inflammatory bowel disease, Autonomic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of any of the following:Renal insufficiency, Chronic anemia,Baseline&#xD;
             systolic blood pressure below age and gender specified normal range or recurrent&#xD;
             symptomatic hypotension (defined as episodes of low blood pressure generally&#xD;
             accompanied by symptoms eg, pallor, cyanosis, irritability, poor feeding) and Cardiac&#xD;
             or vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a clinically significant finding or arrhythmia that indicates abnormal cardiac&#xD;
             function or conduction or QTc-F ≥ 450 msec on screening ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been treated with growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1, or anabolic&#xD;
             steroids in the 6 months prior to Screening, or long-term treatment (&gt; 3 months) at&#xD;
             any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have ever had prior cervicomedullary decompression surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had a fracture of the long bones or spine within 6 months prior to Screening.&#xD;
