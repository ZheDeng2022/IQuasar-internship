      This study is to assess the relationship between CI, disgust and empathy in medical staff&#xD;
      treating patients with scabies, to differentiate the impact of visual and verbal stimuli&#xD;
      contributing to CI and to assess information about CI, disgust and empathy in a family&#xD;
      infested with scabies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Itch is the commonest skin-related symptom, defined as a bodily sensation provoking the urge&#xD;
      to scratch. The induction of itch and scratching by mere (audio-) visual stimuli such as&#xD;
      pictures of insects on skin or video clips showing individuals scratching themselves,&#xD;
      indicates that itch can be perceived in the absence of a pruritogenic somatosensory stimulus.&#xD;
      This phenomenon is referred to as &quot;contagious itch&quot; (CI). CI may play a special role in the&#xD;
      content of scabies both for the affected patients as well as the treating staff: It is a very&#xD;
      common phenomenon that family members who are not infested by scabies themselves experience&#xD;
      itch when watching their infested relatives scratching. The same is very frequently expressed&#xD;
      by health care professionals being confronted with scabies patients. Two further important&#xD;
      factors may be involved in the context of CI: disgust and empathy. Empathy is defined as a&#xD;
      psychological concept that enables individuals to understand and share emotions of others.&#xD;
      Disgust is an emotional response of revulsion to potentially contagious and/or harmful&#xD;
      objects or subjects. This study is to assess the relationship between CI, disgust and empathy&#xD;
      in medical staff treating patients with scabies, to differentiate the impact of visual and&#xD;
      verbal stimuli contributing to CI and to assess information about CI, disgust and empathy in&#xD;
      a family infested with scabies.&#xD;
