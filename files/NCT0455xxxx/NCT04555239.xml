      STUDY PURPOSE: To identify whether a low-cost, minimally invasive, one-time manual medicine&#xD;
      intervention (fascial distortion model, FDM) is effective for the management of subacute and&#xD;
      chronic extremity pain in the emergency department (ED). Demonstration of benefit may have&#xD;
      far-reaching implications including reduction of pain medication use in the ED, shortened ED&#xD;
      visit times, and future use of this intervention in the outpatient setting for chronic pain&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: We plan to conduct a randomized, unblinded clinical trial of FDM for the management&#xD;
      of subacute and chronic extremity pain. 296 patients ages 18 and older seeking care in the ER&#xD;
      for extremity pain that has been present for more than one week and less than three months&#xD;
      will be recruited from four emergency departments within the Carilion Clinic hospital network&#xD;
      over a 3-year time period. Patients are recruited into the study by treating clinicians in&#xD;
      the ER and must describe their pain according to a pattern amenable to treatment with FDM: a.&#xD;
      Single point of sharp pain overlying soft tissues correlating to a herniated trigger point;&#xD;
      b. Single point of sharp pain overlying bone correlating to a continuum distortion; c. Line&#xD;
      or band of pain overlying soft tissues or bone correlating to a trigger band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION: Adult patients presenting to Carilion Franklin Memorial Hospital (CFMH), Carilion&#xD;
      New River Valley Hospital (CNRVH), Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital (CRMH), and Carilion&#xD;
      Stonewall Jackson Hospital (CSJH). Prisoners and patients with known serious psychiatric&#xD;
      comorbidities are specifically excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The primary objective is to determine whether FDM yields significant&#xD;
      improvement in function compared with standard care alone. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      determine whether FDM yields significant improvement in pain compared with standard care&#xD;
      alone. Our exploratory objective is to determine whether FDM yields clinically significant&#xD;
      improvements in pain and function that endure over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: Patients treated with FDM will demonstrate statistically and clinically&#xD;
      significant improvement in function and pain compared with those treated with standard care&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first clinical trial of FDM in the United States and the first in&#xD;
      an ED.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The application of FDM for the treatment of non-specific subacute and chronic extremity pain&#xD;
      in the ED combined with standard care holds enormous promise. High-quality studies&#xD;
      investigating whether single-episode FDM therapy in the ED is effective are needed. Our goal&#xD;
      is to conduct a randomized, prospective clinical trial investigating the use of FDM plus&#xD;
      standard ED pain management for non-specific subacute and chronic extremity compared with&#xD;
      standard ED pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated outcome of this study is statistically and clinically significant improvement&#xD;
      in function and pain in those treated with FDM compared with those compared with standard&#xD;
      emergency department care alone for their extremity pain. Demonstration of such results would&#xD;
      provide stronger evidence base for manual manipulation, particularly in the emergency&#xD;
      department setting. This is a low-cost intervention that can be learned easily by physicians&#xD;
      and providers of a variety of backgrounds (advanced care practitioners, physical therapists,&#xD;
      etc.) and can thus provide an excellent alternative for pain management as opposed to our&#xD;
      traditional approaches to pain such as rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE), and&#xD;
      medications such as NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and acetaminophen. We all&#xD;
      realize that part of the reason we are struggling with an opioid epidemic in our country is&#xD;
      that our traditional approaches to pain management are not always enough and that patients&#xD;
      subsequently become dependent upon stronger medications for pain control that unfortunately&#xD;
      have addictive properties as side effects. If FDM proves to be a successful intervention for&#xD;
      managing subacute and chronic pain in the emergency department with a single treatment,&#xD;
      imagine its applicability on a wider scale in the outpatient setting for chronic pain&#xD;
      management and how this could help us combat the current opioid crisis.&#xD;

    <description>Only treatment of herniated trigger points, continuum distortions, and/or trigger bands will be performed.&#xD;
Herniated trigger points are single areas of sharp pain within soft tissue.&#xD;
Continuum distortions are single points of sharp pain overlying bony tissues.&#xD;
Trigger bands are lines of pain overlying either soft or bony tissues.&#xD;
Treatment with FDM is performed using firm, direct pressure over the area of the patient's pain with the provider's thumb. This pressure is applied at a single point or area indicated by the patient for herniated trigger points and continuum distortions, and along the indicated line of pain for trigger bands.</description>
