  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the seizure frequency during a course of&#xD;
      radiotherapy for high-grade (grade III or IV) gliomas. The patients keep a seizure diary&#xD;
      during and up to 6 weeks following radiotherapy. Every day, the patients document the number&#xD;
      (and type) of seizures and intake of anti-epileptic medication. At the end of radiotherapy,&#xD;
      the patients are asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their satisfaction with the&#xD;
      seizure diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression of seizure activity compared to baseline is defined as increase of frequency of&#xD;
      seizures by more than 50%, increase of severity of seizures, or as Initiation or increase&#xD;
      anti-epileptic medication by at least 25%. To obtain an objective assessment of seizure&#xD;
      activity in addition to patient reported outcomes, an electroencephalography (EEG) is&#xD;
      performed during the first and the sixth week of radiotherapy, and during the sixth week&#xD;
      following radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the study is to generate objective data regarding the occurrence, frequency&#xD;
      and severity of seizures as well as regarding the use of anti-epileptic medication during the&#xD;
      course of radiotherapy for high-grade gliomas. These data are used to evaluate the potential&#xD;
      effect of radiotherapy on occurrence of seizures in these patients and generate hypotheses.&#xD;
      Therefore, statistical analyses of primary and secondary endpoints focus on descriptive&#xD;
      methods. If statistical tests are applied, they are to be interpreted from an exploratory&#xD;
      perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-two patients with documented start of radiotherapy and any documented diary data at&#xD;
      baseline and after start of radiotherapy should be subjected to statistical analysis.&#xD;
      Assuming that 10% of patients do not fulfil these requirements, a total of 35 patients should&#xD;
      be enrolled to this trial. Recruitment should be completed within 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this sample size a one-sample binomial test with a one-sided significance level of 2.5%&#xD;
      has a power of 80% to yield statistical significance if the rate of patients with progression&#xD;
      of seizure events during the course of radiotherapy compared to baseline is 30% (rate under&#xD;
      the alternative hypothesis) assuming a 'natural' background progression-rate of 10% without&#xD;
      radiotherapy (null hypothesis). If the natural course of the disease would lead to a&#xD;
      progression-rate of 5% without radiotherapy only, the power increases to 98%.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas represent the most common type of primary brain tumors and are frequently associated&#xD;
      with clinical symptoms including seizures. The majority of patients with high-grade gliomas&#xD;
      (grade III or IV according to the classification of the World Health Organization) receive&#xD;
      radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, either after neurosurgical resection or as&#xD;
      definitive treatment after biopsy. For patients with grade III or IV gliomas, pre-treatment&#xD;
      seizure rates of 29-67% and 9-45%, respectively, were reported. In a study from our group,&#xD;
      the prevalence of seizures prior to radiotherapy was 48.8% in patients with grade III gliomas&#xD;
      and 21.5% in patients with grade IV gliomas, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy can improve long-term seizure outcomes in glioma patients. However, due to an&#xD;
      acute inflammatory reaction, radiotherapy may lead to acute onset or progression of clinical&#xD;
      symptoms including seizures. To our knowledge, no studies are available that focused on the&#xD;
      subacute effect of radiotherapy on seizure frequency during radiation treatment in glioma&#xD;
      patients. These data would be important to improve the monitoring and, if required, the&#xD;
      anti-epileptic treatment of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the seizure frequency during a course of&#xD;
      radiotherapy for high-grade (grade III or IV) gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients keep a seizure diary during the period of radiotherapy and up to 6 weeks&#xD;
      following radiotherapy. Every day, the patients document the number (and type) of seizures&#xD;
      and intake of anti-epileptic medication. At the end of radiotherapy, the patients are asked&#xD;
      to complete a questionnaire regarding their satisfaction with the seizure diary. One a week&#xD;
      during the radiotherapy course, the seizure diary will be reviewed by a medical staff member.&#xD;
      During the 6 weeks following radiotherapy, the patients are contacted by phone (to minimise&#xD;
      the number of visits to the hospital) once a week to obtain the information from the seizure&#xD;
      diary regarding number and type of seizures. During and following radiotherapy, the weekly&#xD;
      findings of the seizure diary are discussed with a neurologist to initiate or adjust&#xD;
      anti-epileptic medication, if necessary. Patient satisfaction with the seizure diary will be&#xD;
      assessed at the end of radiotherapy using a questionnaire and subjected to descriptive&#xD;
      analysis. In case of a dissatisfaction rate &gt;40%, the seizure diary will be considered not&#xD;
      suitable for patients with high-grade gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the rate of patients with progression of seizure activity during the course of&#xD;
      radiotherapy compared to baseline, defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase of frequency of seizures by more than 50% during the course of radiotherapy as&#xD;
           documented in the seizure diary or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase of severity of seizures, i.e. increase of generalized seizures by more 50%&#xD;
           during the course of radiotehrapy as documented in the seizure diary or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase of the dose of anti-epileptic medication by at least 25% or initiation of&#xD;
           anti-epileptic medication during the course of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain an objective assessment of seizure activity in addition to patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes, an electroencephalography (EEG) is performed during the first and the sixth week of&#xD;
      radiotherapy, and during the sixth week following radiotherapy. Activity typical for epilepsy&#xD;
      includes spike waves, sharp waves and/or sharp slow waves and is classified as absent or&#xD;
      present. A mean change to baseline (during first week of radiotherapy) by 50% regarding the&#xD;
      number of patients with EEG activity typical for epilepsy will be considered clinically&#xD;
      relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the study is to generate objective data regarding the occurrence, frequency&#xD;
      and severity of seizures as well as regarding the use of anti-epileptic medication during the&#xD;
      course of radiotherapy for high-grade gliomas. These data are used to evaluate the potential&#xD;
      effect of radiotherapy on occurrence of seizures in these patients and generate hypotheses.&#xD;
      Therefore, statistical analyses of primary and secondary endpoints focus on descriptive&#xD;
      methods. If statistical tests are applied, they are to be interpreted from an exploratory&#xD;
      perspective. The seizure frequency at baseline and during the course of radiotherapy will be&#xD;
      calculated by adding the seizures during each time period evaluated. The resulting sum will&#xD;
      divided by the total duration (days), excluding those days with no available diary data. This&#xD;
      figure will be normalized to a weekly rate. The resulting normalized frequencies form the&#xD;
      basis for calculating the primary endpoint. The point estimate of the rate of progressors&#xD;
      (increased seizure activity) will be presented together with 95% confidence interval. To test&#xD;
      whether the rate of progressions is significantly increased beyond 10%, a one-sided binomial&#xD;
      test at a one-sided 2.5% significance level will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normalized seizure frequencies over time will also be calculated within sequential 3-week&#xD;
      intervals, namely weeks 1-3 and 4-6 during radiotherapy, and weeks 1-3 (weeks 7-9 in total)&#xD;
      and weeks 4-6 (weeks 10-12 in total) following radiotherapy. These frequencies will be&#xD;
      subjected to descriptive statistics as well as graphical presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-two patients with documented start of radiotherapy and any documented diary data at&#xD;
      baseline and after start of radiotherapy should be subjected to statistical analysis.&#xD;
      Assuming that 10% of patients do not fulfil these requirements, a total of 35 patients should&#xD;
      be enrolled to this trial. This sample size is set at the maximum that is deemed achievable&#xD;
      in this single-center trial within the timeframe of the study given the size of the target&#xD;
      population. However, with this sample size a one-sample binomial test with a one-sided&#xD;
      significance level of 2.5% has a power of 80% to yield statistical significance if the rate&#xD;
      of patients with progression of seizure events during the course of radiotherapy compared to&#xD;
      baseline is 30% (rate under the alternative hypothesis) assuming a 'natural' background&#xD;
      progression-rate of 10% without radiotherapy (null hypothesis). The latter rate was chosen&#xD;
      after discussions with neurologists. If the natural course of the disease would lead to a&#xD;
      progression-rate of 5% without radiotherapy only, the power increases to 98%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of all 35 patients (32 patients plus 10% drop-outs) should be completed&#xD;
      within 12 months. The radiotherapy period will be 6-6.5 weeks, and the follow up period 6&#xD;
      weeks. This equals a total running time for the trial of approximately 15 months.&#xD;
