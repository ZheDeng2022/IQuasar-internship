    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics and the&#xD;
      potential immunological reaction of single intravenous recombinant human thymosin β4（NL005）or&#xD;
      placebo 0.5, 2.0,5.0μg/kg in Chinese healthy volunteers.30 volunteers will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of three groups to receive either NL005 or placebo for 10 consecutive days.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability pharmacokinetics and potential immune responses of multiple NL005&#xD;
      intravenous administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of 30 subjects will receive an NL005 or placebo dose of 0.5μg/kg 2.0 μg/kg and&#xD;
      5.0 μg/kg for 10 consecutive days at a ratio of 4:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While observing the safety of the subjects in each dose group, about 5mL of venous blood was&#xD;
      collected for the ADA study in healthy subjects 14 days and 28 days after the first&#xD;
      administration of the drug.&#xD;

    <description>Determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) by comprehensive evaluation of drug safety by adverse event observation, vital signs, physical examination, laboratory examination, electrocardiogram, etc. In this study, DLT was defined as liver, kidney, heart and mental nervous system toxicity of level 2 or above or blood system toxicity of level 3 or above and other systemic adverse events occurred within 14 days after drug administration, and the adverse events were judged to be related to the experimental drug use.If more than 3 (including 3) DLT cases are present in any dose group, the test should be terminated. The previous dose of this dose is considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</description>
