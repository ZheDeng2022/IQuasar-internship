  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a 12-week school-based physical activity (PA) program with a&#xD;
      2-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. It will target overweight and obese&#xD;
      children with intellectual disability (ID). The primary outcomes will be both fatness-related&#xD;
      and fitness-related outcomes. In addition, the effect of the intervention on blood pressure&#xD;
      will be evaluated as the secondary outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity and lower HRPF levels are major threats to public health. The previous&#xD;
      research finds that children with ID are more vulnerable to be obesity and lower HRPF levels&#xD;
      than general pediatric population. In addition, the transition from adolescence to young&#xD;
      adulthood is recognized as a particularly high-risk period for weight gain. However,&#xD;
      Interventions to reduce obesity and improve HRPF levels among adolescents with ID are scarce.&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to implement and evaluate a fun game-based PA program to&#xD;
      reduce overweight/obesity and improve health-related physical fitness (HRPF) levels among&#xD;
      adolescents with ID (aged 12-18 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a 3-month intervention and a 3-month follow-up. Totally Forty-eight&#xD;
      overweight/obese adolescents with mild intellectual disability (ID) will be recruited from&#xD;
      special schools in China and then randomly assigned into two groups (n=24 for each group).&#xD;
      Selection criteria for participants are: (1) children with mild ID; (2) aged 12-18 years old;&#xD;
      (3) being overweight or obese; (4) without physical disability and other relevant health&#xD;
      conditions. Participants in the experimental group will receive a fun game-based PA program&#xD;
      (60 min/time, 2 sessions/week, 24 sessions totally) at school. No intervention will be&#xD;
      provided to participants in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the two groups (N=48) will undertake repeated measurements on a set of&#xD;
      study outcomes for three times. All measurements are non-invasive and no potential&#xD;
      consequences are expected. In addition, questionnaires will be used to collect each&#xD;
      participant's information of socio-demographic characteristics, physical activity level and&#xD;
      eating habits (about 15 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect the findings from the study would make up the knowledge gap and help&#xD;
      eliminate existing health inequities among children with ID. It would serve as an example for&#xD;
      use of other researchers, policy-makers, and the public to tackle off obesity among&#xD;
      adolescents with ID in a global scale. If effective, this program would be welcomed and&#xD;
      adopted by other special schools in the future. In addition, the effective model can also be&#xD;
      extended to reach students with ID in normal schools.&#xD;

At the end of the test, the participants will be instructed to keep walking to aid in the recovery process. The distance will be measured by the number of laps around the track, adding extra distance as required (VOLEK et al., 2003).

    <measure>30-second sit-to-stand</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>It will be used to assess participants' lower limb strength and endurance. It measures the maximum number of times a participant can rise to a full standing position from a seated position in a 30-second period, without pushing off with their arms. This test is administered using a school chair without arms, with a seat height around 14 inches (35.6 cm). The back of the chair will be placed against a wall to prevent it from moving. The participants will be instructed to sit in the middle of the chair, back straight, feet approximately shoulder width apart and placed on the floor at an angle slightly back from the knees, with one foot slightly in front of the other to help maintain balance. Arms are crossed at the wrists and held against the chest.</description>

    <description>It will be used to assess participants' hand and forearm muscular strength. During the test, the participant will be instructed to adopt a standing position, with arms at his/her side, not touching the body. The participant will be asked to squeeze the dynamometer with as much force as possible, being careful to squeeze only once for each measurement. Three trials will be made with a pause of 10-20 s between each to avoid the effects of muscular fatigue. Right and left hands will be alternated. The best score will be recorded.</description>

One leg will be fully extended with the foot flat against the end of the testing instrument.

The arms will be extended forward over the measuring scale with hands palms down, one on top of the other. Each participant will be instructed to reach directly forward with both hands along the scale four times and to hold the position of the fourth reach for at least 1 s. After measuring one side, the participant will be asked to switch the position of his/her legs and reach again. The participant can allow the bent knee to move to the side if necessary as the body moves forward.</description>
