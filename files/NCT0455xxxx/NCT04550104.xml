      CONCORDE is a multi-institution, multi-arm, Phase IB study that will determine the&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profiles of different DNA damage repair&#xD;
      inhibitors (DDRis) when given in an open label fashion in combination with fixed dose&#xD;
      curative intent radiotherapy (RT) in patients with stage IIB/IIIA/IIIB NSCLC. The RP2D will&#xD;
      be evaluated by incorporating the number of observed dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) into a&#xD;
      time to event continuous reassessment method (TiTE- CRM) model within each of the&#xD;
      experimental arms. TiTE-CRM is used here to take into account longer-term toxicities up to&#xD;
      13.5 months post start of radiotherapy and use these to inform dose escalation decision&#xD;
      making.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      that has not spread beyond the chest area. Radiotherapy is used as a curative treatment but&#xD;
      unfortunately for most patients the cancer can return. Radiotherapy kills cells by damaging&#xD;
      their DNA. Cells have the ability to repair that damage, especially the cells of normal&#xD;
      tissue. If DNA repair can be prevented radiotherapy should be more effective causing the&#xD;
      cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use new drugs that affect how cells repair DNA damage, called DNA damage&#xD;
      response inhibitors (DDRi). These will be given together with radiotherapy to hopefully&#xD;
      improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy. The study will try to find out the most effective&#xD;
      and safe dose of this combination treatment. There will be a clinical trial where patients&#xD;
      due to have radiotherapy, with the hope of successful treatment that could lead to cure from&#xD;
      their cancer or extension of life, will be offered entry onto the study. All patients will&#xD;
      receive their radiotherapy, with 3 out of every 4 people also receiving a single DDRi drug&#xD;
      alongside this. Both patients and study doctors will know prior to the start of the actual&#xD;
      treatment whether a DDRi will be given, and if so which one; no placebos will be used. The&#xD;
      patients will be followed closely to check for side effects and to assess how their cancer is&#xD;
      responding to treatment. Blood samples will be taken to monitor treatment progress and to try&#xD;
      to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from this type of combined treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The trial is designed as a randomised Phase I dose escalation platform study, using the TiTE CRM design to find the RP2D of each DDRi with RT combination. At the time of patient identification the treating centre will be informed of the allocated study arm following a pre-specified prioritisation schedule. Consenting participants will be randomised between DDRi with RT or RT only. Patients are not randomised between experimental arms nor will endpoints be compared between experimental arms. RT only participants will be pooled across the platform to provide contemporary data on toxicity.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Best overall response</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years after end of RT</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response will be measured as the best response (complete response, partial response or stable disease) recorded until disease progression, reported up to 2 years post-RT. This will be assessed using RECIST 1.1</description>
