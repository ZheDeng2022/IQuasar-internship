  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study in order to obtain complete data on 30&#xD;
      participants. The investigators will be assessing if Augmented reality in combination with&#xD;
      treadmill training is safe and feasible to use in the clinical environment with participants&#xD;
      who have chronic TBI and if there is a signal of effect that this intervention may be more&#xD;
      beneficial than treadmill training alone or standard of care.&#xD;

    <description>In-office neurocognitive test that is a non-invasive clinical procedure designed to efficiently and objectively assess a broad spectrum of brain function performance or domains under challenge. Finger tapping test and symbol digit coding will be aggregated to arrive at one reported value representing the psychomotor speed domain. Above average domain scores indicate a standard score (SS) greater than 109 or a Percentile Rank (PR) greater than 74, indicating a high functioning test subject. Average is a SS 90-109 or PR 25-74, indicating normal function. Low Average is a SS 80-89 or PR 9-24 indicating a slight deficit or impairment. Below Average is a SS 70-79 or PR 2-8, indicating a moderate level of deficit or impairment. Very Low is a SS less than 70 or a PR less than 2, indicating a deficit and impairment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Augmented Reality</intervention_name>
    <description>Augmented Reality (AR) systems are computer-based applications that allow an individual to view a simulated environment and dynamically interact within this environment in real-time. Augmented reality activities will be chosen by the therapist based on the primary deficits assessed during baseline testing.</description>

  </intervention>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Treadmill training</intervention_name>
    <description>The goal of each session will be to increase balance and mobility challenge by increasing speed and minimizing BWS. Appropriate BWS will be chosen at the beginning of each training session. Participants will walk for 1 minute on the treadmill at 30%, 20% and 10% BWS. Maximum walking speed will be determined at each level of BWS and the participant will spend the remainder of the session ambulating with BWS at which they were able to achieve maximum walking speed. Additional BWS will be provided up to 30% of the participant's total body weight if the treating therapist identifies safety concerns or unfavorable gait kinematics. If a safe and kinematically appropriate gait pattern is unable to be achieved at up to 30% BWS, the previously determined walking speed will be reduced to achieve a safe and appropriate walking pattern. Participants will be encouraged not to use upper extremity support while ambulating with BWS.</description>
