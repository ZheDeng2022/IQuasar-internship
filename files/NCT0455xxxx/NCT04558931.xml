      with CellProtect as compared to Isatuximab for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After confirmation of the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms:&#xD;
Isatuximab in combination with CellProtect (ISA/CellProtect experimental arm), or Isatuximab (ISA, control arm).&#xD;
Randomization will be at diagnosis and before the start of the treatment for patients eligible for SCT. Treatment administration will start within 100 days from AST date.&#xD;
Patients will be treated until disease progression (max 3 years), unacceptable adverse event (AE), patient's decision to stop the study treatment, death or any other reasons, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
Closing of randomization will occur after a total of approximately 60 patients have been randomized.&#xD;
After randomisation, all study patients will donate starting material for the production of the IMP.&#xD;
Manufacturing of CellProtect is promptly initiated for patients randomised to the active IMP arm A.</intervention_model_description>
