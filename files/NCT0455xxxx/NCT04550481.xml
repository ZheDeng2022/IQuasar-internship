  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well lisinopril may work in preventing the progression&#xD;
      of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a condition where there is an&#xD;
      accumulation of fatty cells in the liver. NAFLD increases a person's risk of developing liver&#xD;
      cancer. Liver fibrosis is the common finding of chronic liver diseases leading to reduced&#xD;
      liver function. Lisinopril is a medication that is commonly used to treat high blood&#xD;
      pressure. Lisinopril may help to decrease liver fibrosis. The purpose of this trial is to&#xD;
      find out what effect, if any, lisinopril has on a patient's risk of developing liver cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis will demonstrate a change in PRO-C3,&#xD;
      a marker of liver fibrosis, following 24 weeks of treatment with lisinopril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Noninvasive measures of fibrosis and steatosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Change from baseline in XM-PRO-C3 (cross-linked multimeric PRO-C3). Ib. Change from&#xD;
      baseline in steatosis, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction&#xD;
      (MRI-PDFF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ic. Change from baseline in steatosis, as measured by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP),&#xD;
      determined with transient elastography (Fibroscan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Id. Change from baseline in liver stiffness as measured with magnetic resonance elastography&#xD;
      (MRE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ie. Change from baseline in liver stiffness as measured with transient elastography&#xD;
      (Fibroscan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If. Changes from baseline in Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ig. Change in inflammatory markers (caspase cleaved cytokeratin 18 [CK-18], NF-kappaB,&#xD;
      TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, IL6 and IL8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lisinopril orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 24 weeks in absence of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed up at 32 weeks after the start of study medication.&#xD;

    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize changes and values at each time point. The primary analysis will be performed using a paired t-test to compare the pre- to post-treatment changes in PRO-C3 levels. PRO-C3 levels will be log-transformed to satisfy the normality assumption. If log-transformation does not satisfy the normality assumption, a signed rank test will be used.</description>

Model selection will be conducted according to the purposeful model selection approach (REF) to a parsimonious set of predictors. Model fit will be assessed using standard regression diagnostics. Changes in categorical outcomes from pre- to post-treatment will also be categorized as improvement versus (vs.) no improvement (i.e. no change or worsening in steatosis grade), and logistic regression models will be used to examine association with baseline characteristics.</description>

    <description>Descriptive statistics, including means, 95% confidence intervals, or median and inter-quartile range, will be used to summarize changes as well as biomarker values at each time point. To determine whether changes in these biomarkers occurred following treatment, paired t-test will be used as described for the analysis of the primary endpoint. Biomarker values may be transformed to satisfy the normality assumption. If no suitable transformation can be found, a signed rank test will be used. For the analysis of inflammatory biomarkers, tests will be adjusted for multiple comparisons to control the false discovery rate using the method of Romano.</description>
