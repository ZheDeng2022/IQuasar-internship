  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging provides a valuable tool for the&#xD;
      diagnosis and differential diagnosis, staging of various tumors. Malignant tumor is composed&#xD;
      of tumor cells and tumor stroma, which occupies the vast majority of the tumor.&#xD;
      Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are an important part of the tumor stroma. Fibroblast&#xD;
      activation protein (FAP) is over-expressed in CAF, which is closely related to tumor growth,&#xD;
      invasion, metastasis, immunosuppression and prognosis; and the expression level of FAP in&#xD;
      normal tissues and organs is very low. So it becomes an excellent target for cancer diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment. Radionuclide-labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) that&#xD;
      specifically target to FAP as a tracer for PET imaging can be applied for targeted diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of cancer. Recently, some studies have found that gallium-68 (68Ga) -FAPI as a&#xD;
      new novel positron tracer has shown to be with good application potential. In this&#xD;
      prospective study, the investigators will use integrated PET/MR, and PET/CT with the agent&#xD;
      68Ga-FAPI and conventional imaging agent [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) to diagnose and&#xD;
      stage various cancers, the aim is to make up for the deficiency in FDG PET imaging in the&#xD;
      diagnosis and staging of some cancers.&#xD;

      Positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging provides a valuable tool for the&#xD;
      diagnosis and differential diagnosis, staging of various tumors. The most commonly used&#xD;
      imaging agent is [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), known as the &quot;molecule of the century&quot;.&#xD;
      However, in some low-grade gliomas, mucinous adenocarcinoma, bronchoalveolar carcinoma,&#xD;
      primary hepatocellular carcinoma, renal clear cell carcinoma and some prostate cancers,&#xD;
      factors such as the low expression level of tumor glucose transporter but high level of&#xD;
      dephosphorylation, and the low number of tumor cells in tumor tissues can also be manifested&#xD;
      as low absorption of 18F-FDG; in addition, 18F-FDG PET has limited ability to detect small&#xD;
      lesions in some organs such as brain, liver, and kidneys that have physiological uptake or&#xD;
      excretion of FDG with the relatively high background signal; moreover, the distribution of&#xD;
      FDG in the body is easily affected by blood sugar. These factors limit the application value&#xD;
      of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the differential diagnosis and staging of some malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A malignant tumor is composed of tumor cells and tumor stroma, which occupies the vast&#xD;
      majority of the tumor. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are an important part of the tumor&#xD;
      stroma. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is over-expressed in CAF, which is closely&#xD;
      related to tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, immunosuppression and prognosis; and the&#xD;
      expression level of FAP in normal tissues and organs is very low, so it becomes an excellent&#xD;
      target for cancer diagnosis and treatment. The use of radionuclide-labeled fibroblast&#xD;
      activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) that specifically bind to FAP as a tracer for PET&#xD;
      imaging can be applied for targeted diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Recently, some studies&#xD;
      have found that gallium-68 (68Ga) -FAPI as a new novel positron tracer has shown to be with&#xD;
      good application potential. The probe has very low background uptake in different types of&#xD;
      cancer, so it can obtain high image contrast and clear tumor boundary. And it has good&#xD;
      stability in serum and can be quickly removed from normal organs in vivo. In this project, we&#xD;
      plan to apply the integrated PET / MR imaging of fibroblast activating protein (FAP) in the&#xD;
      diagnosis and staging of malignant tumors, and compare it with 18F-FDG PET / CT imaging, so&#xD;
      as to make up for the deficiency in FDG PET imaging in the diagnosis and staging of some&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
