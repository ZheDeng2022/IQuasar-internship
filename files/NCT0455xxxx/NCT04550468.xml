  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing worldwide, with ~380 M currently&#xD;
      suffering from this chronic, debilitating disease. T2D is characterized by high blood glucose&#xD;
      levels in the mornings and after meals. The largest hyperglycemic spike often occurs after&#xD;
      breakfast. Targeting this meal may be a simple, feasible strategy to improve glycemic control&#xD;
      and reduce risk for diabetes complications. It is hypothesized that consuming a low&#xD;
      carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) breakfast for 3 months, when compared to a standard low-fat&#xD;
      breakfast will improve blood glucose control, increase satiety and improve body composition&#xD;
      in people with T2D. This information will test whether the simple dietary strategy of&#xD;
      limiting carbohydrates at breakfast could help in managing T2D.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A 3-month parallel-group randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to either the Low-carb High-fat breakfast (LCHF, n=41) or a low-fat&#xD;
      &quot;standard care&quot; control breakfast (CTL, n=41), to be consumed daily for a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to COVID-19 pandemic, this study was adapted to be conducted remotely through&#xD;
      video/telephone conference meetings between participants and study staff, along with mailing&#xD;
      of study materials before and after the intervention for remote data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will be provided with a menu of 8 LCHF breakfasts or 8 CTL breakfasts from which&#xD;
      to choose each morning. Breakfast options (designed by a registered dietitian) will be&#xD;
      controlled in macronutrient content and calories (~400-500 kcal), but allow for personal&#xD;
      preference and autonomy to promote adherence.&#xD;
