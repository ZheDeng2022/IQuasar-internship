  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The State of Wisconsin is now expanding its investment in care coordination models as an&#xD;
      effort to reduce inappropriate hospital emergency department (ED) use, improve health&#xD;
      outcomes, and reduce Medicaid expenditures. This effort begins with a pilot program to&#xD;
      support emergency department care coordination in hospitals and health systems that apply and&#xD;
      are selected to participate in the pilot program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Wisconsin Medicaid program seeks to understand whether this program achieves its intended&#xD;
      goals and, specifically, whether the Medicaid payment for such care coordination services&#xD;
      produces the intended program outcomes. Hospitals will select members that will receive care&#xD;
      coordination services. In a quasi-experimental approach, the study team will compare members&#xD;
      that do vs. do not receive the services will be used examine the effects of care coordination&#xD;
      and referrals on total ED visits, primary-care treatable ED visits, non-emergent ED visits,&#xD;
      and health care costs, as well as the specific effects of referring patients to providers who&#xD;
      offer low-cost and after-hours care. To assess the importance of targeting, study team will&#xD;
      conduct stratified analyses of vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities and&#xD;
      individuals with specific clinical needs.&#xD;
