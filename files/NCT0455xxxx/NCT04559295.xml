      Intradiscal delivery of bone marrow concentrate (BMC) into discs, facet, epidural space, and&#xD;
      sacroiliac joints&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study if the outcomes for the injection of bone marrow concentrate (BMC) in patients with&#xD;
      disc, facet, epidural space, and sacroiliac joint pain create a clinically meaningful&#xD;
      improvement in pain and function. Further analysis will determine if there be any variance in&#xD;
      patient reported outcome due to the individual's pre-procedure cell count and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: An injection of autologous BMC into discs, facets, sacroiliac joints, and&#xD;
      epidural space will improve pain and function in patients with IDD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: There will be a direct relationship between an individual's BMC composition and&#xD;
      the patient's reported outcomes&#xD;
