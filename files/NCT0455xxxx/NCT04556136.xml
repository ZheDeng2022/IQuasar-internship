  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capability of a standing phototherapy kiosk&#xD;
      (SPK) to stimulate cutaneous vitamin D3 and subsequent production of 25 Hydroxyvitamin (OH) D&#xD;
      safely and as efficiently as an oral vitamin D3 supplement of 600 IU taken daily over a 10&#xD;
      week intervention period. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial with two treatment&#xD;
      arms; ~120 volunteers will be assigned to either the SPK or to a 600 IU daily oral vitamin D3&#xD;
      supplement for 10 weeks. The SPK is an innovative, networked, self-care technology that&#xD;
      stimulates endogenous vitamin D production with two ~2-minute treatments per month. It will&#xD;
      be tested in an ambulatory setting where enrolled/assigned participants of various baseline&#xD;
      levels of 25(OH)D will present for a treatment dose, based on Fitzpatrick skin type category,&#xD;
      every other week for 10 weeks. The SPK does not produce a cosmetic tan or dispense pills.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study uses a prospective, longitudinal, randomized design with repeated&#xD;
      measures to address vitamin D sufficiency in Active Duty (AD), retiree, beneficiary, and&#xD;
      Department of Army civilian populations. It is important and necessary to conduct this study&#xD;
      with adult humans, military personnel in particular, to determine acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility of this phototherapy kiosk as an addition to existing Warfighter resources to&#xD;
      promote health and resilience. Anticipating 20% attrition, approximately 120 volunteers will&#xD;
      be recruited from Madigan Army Medical Center and Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM), a large&#xD;
      joint base in the Pacific Northwest, where over 25,000 Soldiers and Airmen train every day&#xD;
      and regional beneficiaries number ~98,000. Recruiting efforts will attempt to capture a&#xD;
      representative sample of the population including genders, diverse ethnicities, and a range&#xD;
      of age (18-70 years) and body mass index, who have no contraindication for Ultraviolet (UV) B&#xD;
      exposure or oral vitamin D supplementation. Using a computer-generated block design,&#xD;
      volunteers will be randomized to one of two treatment groups; 1) oral vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation, or 2) standing phototherapy kiosk (SPK) with UVB exposure, for a 10 week&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1- Supplement: A Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC) Research Pharmacist will dispense a&#xD;
      10-week supply of the vitamin D3 600 International Units (IU) oral supplement to subjects&#xD;
      assigned to this group one time. The Project Coordinator will work with the pharmacist to&#xD;
      coordinate pick-up of supplement bottles for subjects or optimal in-person dispensing times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - SPK: The Project Coordinator will oversee the phototherapy treatment. Spectrum&#xD;
      isolation modules in the kiosk will deliver the UVB dose under supervised conditions over a&#xD;
      2-5 minute interval based on the Fitzpatrick skin type category with the subject wearing&#xD;
      minimal or no clothing, preferably no more than a bathing suit and protective eye-wear. The&#xD;
      experience in the SPK is designed to be comfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll all eligible adult volunteers regardless of their baseline 25(OH)D level; it&#xD;
      is important to show there is no potential for harm from phototherapy, even if the baseline&#xD;
      25(OH)D level is above 30 ng/mL. We also must learn the trajectory of vitamin D absorption&#xD;
      and availability over a 3-4 month period in order to make evidence-based therapeutic&#xD;
      recommendations. It is not possible to blind the subjects or research team to the group&#xD;
      assignment. Serum levels of 25(OH)D, calcium, and parathyroid hormone will be drawn at&#xD;
      baseline (T0), and immediately following the intervention at 10 weeks (T6); at 14 weeks (T8),&#xD;
      25(OH) D will be drawn to document sustainment of treatment effect. A survey will be&#xD;
      completed at T1 to capture relevant demographic, medical history, sun exposure, travel, daily&#xD;
      activities, and dietary data. Active duty participants will also report the number of days on&#xD;
      profile for the previous three months, at T1 and T6. A survey regarding Device Usability will&#xD;
      be administered upon kiosk protocol completion. We will analyze data using repeated measures&#xD;
      analysis of variance adjusting for significant covariates such as 25(OH)D level at baseline.&#xD;
      Logistic regression analyses will be used to predict outcomes and explain the&#xD;
      interrelationships among variables, i.e. age, gender, body fat, BMI, ethnicity, and sun&#xD;
      exposure relationship to 25(OH)D serum levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serum 25(OH)D level. This primary outcome will be crucial to establishing whether the&#xD;
           device, a standing phototherapy kiosk (SPK), is equivalent to oral vitamin D3&#xD;
           supplementation which is currently the standard of care prescribed by licensed providers&#xD;
           to address vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency. We will establish a baseline 25(OH)D&#xD;
           level for both study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in serum 25(OH)D at 10 weeks to reflect adequacy of SPK and supplement treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change in serum 25(OH)D at 14 weeks will evaluate sustainment of the post-SPK treatment&#xD;
           level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Device acceptability by Device Usability Scale. To properly evaluate the outcome of&#xD;
           acceptability of this demonstration project involving two arms, one an SPK and the other&#xD;
           an oral vitamin D supplement, the research team will administer the Device Usability&#xD;
           Scale upon study completion at 14 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Device feasibility will be assessed by meticulously tracking of the number of potential&#xD;
           participants screened, the number of enrolled subjects, and attrition from each arm.&#xD;
           Reasons for attrition will be documented following a discussion with the subject, if&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>For volunteers assigned to the phototherapy kiosk, a measured dose of UVB was administered under conditions of full body exposure of 0.6 minimal erythemal dose (MED) every other week for 10 weeks. The stimulation of cutaneous vitamin D and subsequent 25(OH)D production from phototherapy was compared to the effect of a Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) based dose of 600 IU vitamin D3 supplement daily for 10 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Volunteers assigned to this group were administered phototherapy treatments in a standing phototherapy kiosk once every other week, for 10 weeks. The treatment usually lasts no more than 10 minutes and is based on the Fitzpatrick skin type classification tool, which is self-reported via the computer touch screen in the kiosk.</description>

    <description>Volunteers assigned to this group were provided with a 10-week supply (70 pills) of a vitamin D3 supplement. Consented subjects were instructed to take one 600 IU pill by mouth each day for ten weeks. They were instructed to take this with a meal. This dose is the RDA for adults between 18 and 70 years old according to the Institute of Medicine Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D and Calcium.</description>

    <description>Benesol is a freestanding booth designed to deliver a small amount of targeted UVB with an interactive user interface and cloud-based software that enables patient self-care. The treatment delivery mechanism uses a metal halide lamp with a series of filters and a lens to optimize full-body exposure to the narrow spectrum (293 - 303nm) of UVB light most efficient at producing vitamin D3. The device uses software to identify patients, establish individual skin types and determine dosage. The system has been designed to manage exposure time and frequency and deliver 60% of a skin-type-adjusted Minimal Erythemal Dose (MED). The expected result for users is a rise in blood levels of 25(OH)D via the endogenous pathway.</description>

    <description>Each subject assigned to the comparison group was instructed to take one vitamin D3 pill, dispensed by the research pharmacist, each day with a meal for 70 days. Subjects were instructed not to take any additional vitamin D supplementation during the study period. This dosing frequency is consistent with the RDA recommendation. Subjects were instructed to bring their pill bottle with them when returning for their follow up appointment.</description>
