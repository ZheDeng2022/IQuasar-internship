  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to provide confirmation that Cognitive Remediation (CR) for&#xD;
      schizophrenia, when personalized based on pre-treatment assessment of early auditory&#xD;
      processing ability, facilitates improved cognitive and functional outcomes. Additional aims&#xD;
      of this study address the mechanisms of treatment effect. The study uses a repeated-measures&#xD;
      randomized trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be by invitation, open to individuals receiving services at select community&#xD;
      behavioral health facilities where CR is offered. Clients who are eligible for the service,&#xD;
      who agree to participate in research and who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      assessed on outcome measures and categorized via performance on the Tone Matching (TM) test,&#xD;
      as EAP impaired (EAP-) or EAP intact (EAP+). Subsequently, EAP- and EAP+ subgroups will be&#xD;
      randomized to either (1) Brain Basics (BB; n = 100), an EAP-enhanced CR approach or (2) Brain&#xD;
      Training (BT; n = 100), a routine CR approach. Participants will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      a second pre-treatment assessment to measure electrophysiologic responses to auditory&#xD;
      stimuli. All participants will be scheduled to repeat outcome measure assessments after&#xD;
      treatment and after a follow-up period. The EAP- group receiving BB will be invited to repeat&#xD;
      electrophysiological paradigms post-treatment to investigate mechanisms of change related to&#xD;
      the CR intervention. Verbal learning will be the primary outcome with functional capacity the&#xD;
      secondary outcome. EEG is exploratory and will examine neurophysiologic markers of need for&#xD;
      and response to EAP training.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This personalized Cognitive Remediation (CR) confirmatory efficacy trial will be conducted at&#xD;
      behavioral health facilities offering CR, located within the New York metropolitan area.&#xD;
      Participants for this study will include adults diagnosed with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder, age 18-68, who have identified cognitive health as a pertinent&#xD;
      treatment for recovery goal attainment and are seeking CR services. Individuals referred to&#xD;
      CR may be referred for research by their treating clinician or may be self-referred.&#xD;
      Consented individuals will receive a numeric study ID which will be used to de-identify all&#xD;
      data collected for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time 1 (baseline) outcomes assessments conducted by the research team include early auditory&#xD;
      processing (EAP) ability, cognitive ability, and functioning. Participants will be classified&#xD;
      as EAP impaired (EAP-) or EAP intact (EAP+). Following completion of Time 1 assessments,&#xD;
      assignment to treatment condition will be stratified by EAP ability and randomized to Brain&#xD;
      Basics (BB, n=100) or Brain Training (BT, n=100). Participants will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in a separate EEG assessment of Mismatch Negativity (MMN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CR will be conducted by trained clinicians at each performance site. CR will entail 30,&#xD;
      60-minute sessions administered two times a week (approximately 15 weeks). All participants&#xD;
      will continue to receive recovery oriented therapeutic activities. Participants will be&#xD;
      scheduled to repeat behavioral assessments at Time 2 (post-treatment) and Time 3 (follow-up)&#xD;
      with a research team member who is blind to treatment group. The EAP- group receiving Brain&#xD;
      Basics will also repeat EEG paradigms at Time 2 to explore mechanisms of change related to&#xD;
      the CR intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal learning will be the primary outcome with functional capacity the secondary outcome.&#xD;
      EEG is exploratory and will examine neurophysiologic markers of need for and response to EAP&#xD;
      training. Mediation analysis will examine whether gains in cognition (verbal learning)&#xD;
      mediate the gains in EAP and functioning. This will inform our understanding of EAP as the&#xD;
      therapeutic change mechanism for about half of CR participants and confirm that EAP training&#xD;
      need not be given to those CR participants with baseline intact EAP.&#xD;
