    <measure>Number of patients able to adhere to resistant starch (RS) supplement schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be determined by calculating the number of patients who have taken 70% or more of scheduled dose of dietary intervention. Patients will be asked to record doses of starch taken and will be provided a table in which doses can be checked off.</description>

    <measure>Frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) attributable to ICI therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months (3 months after RS supplement discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be assessed using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The frequency of known serious effects of ICIs will be compared to historical rates.</description>

    <measure>Change in luminal microbiome composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months (3 months after RS supplement discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>Weekly stool samples will be compared to the baseline sample (prior to starting starch-based dietary supplement). Stool samples will be analyzed for microbial nucleic acids to characterize the components of the stool microbiome.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months (3 months after RS supplement discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>Weekly stool samples will be compared to the baseline sample (prior to starting starch-based dietary supplement). Key metabolic byproducts will be identified in stool specimens using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients starting dual immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (ipilimumab and nivolumab&#xD;
             in any dose combination) for solid cancer treatment per FDA approved indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of colectomy and/or gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel&#xD;
             syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active Clostridium difficile infection. Active infection is defined as a&#xD;
             stool sample positive for Clostridium difficile toxin by EIA and either symptoms&#xD;
             (frequent loose stools) OR imaging findings consistent with toxic megacolon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to take oral supplements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with existing gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea&#xD;
             (watery stool), nausea and/or actively requiring regular anti-emetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic bowel metastasis including pain, severe constipation, or&#xD;
             gastrointestinal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving antibiotic within 14 days of ICI therapy initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any physical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             would pose unacceptable risk to the patient or raise concern that the patient would&#xD;
             not comply with protocol procedures.&#xD;
