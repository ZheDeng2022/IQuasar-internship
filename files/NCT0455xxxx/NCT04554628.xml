  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early prediction of AKI can help to improve patients' outcome through early institution of&#xD;
      the appropriate intervention, thus the current study hypothesizes that urine analysis for&#xD;
      certain markers may provide an early knowledge about the possibility of oncoming kidney&#xD;
      affection secondary to organ and tissue trauma affecting patients admitted to surgical ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study tries to evaluate the value of urinary markers as early predictors of&#xD;
      possible development of AKI in patients admitted to surgical ICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be clinically evaluated for demographic and clinical data. Severity of&#xD;
      injury and number of surgical interventions will be evaluated using the simplified&#xD;
      Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS-28) and the extent of impact of associated&#xD;
      diseases on patients' physiological and body organs' functions will be evaluated using the&#xD;
      Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure&#xD;
      assessment (SOFA) . Higher scores indicate more severe illness and for the TISS-28 score,&#xD;
      each therapeutic intervention will be assigned 1 to 4 points, and the points will be summed&#xD;
      daily to obtain the overall score and higher score indicates a higher number of therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of AKI Development of AKI within the first 48 hours after ICU admission and its&#xD;
      staging will be defined according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria. Each stage&#xD;
      will be defined by the extent of change in serum creatinine level (∆SCr) as follows: Mild if&#xD;
      Scr was increased by ≥0.3 mg/ml or ∆SCr was ≥1.5-2-fold from baseline, Moderate if ∆SCr was&#xD;
      &gt;2-3-fold from baseline and Severe if ∆SCr was increase by &gt;3-fold from baseline .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory investigations Blood samples will be sent for estimation of serum creatinine (SCr)&#xD;
      . Urine samples will be sent for spot creatinine , UNGAL, KIM1.&#xD;
