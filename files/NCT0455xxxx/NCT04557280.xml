  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to study the pharmacokinetics of selatogrel (ACT-246475) using different&#xD;
      administration modes and formulations. The clinical pharmacology data will be used to support&#xD;
      demonstration of bioequivalence and interchangeability of the different formulations.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure 100 to 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 50 to 90 mmHg, and&#xD;
             pulse rate 45 to 100 bpm (inclusive), measured on the left arm, after 5 minutes in the&#xD;
             supine position at screening and Day-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically relevant abnormalities, measured&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of major medical or surgical disorders, which, in the opinion of the&#xD;

             excretion of the study treatment (appendectomy and herniotomy allowed, cholecystectomy&#xD;
             not allowed).&#xD;

             malformations, peptic ulcers.&#xD;
