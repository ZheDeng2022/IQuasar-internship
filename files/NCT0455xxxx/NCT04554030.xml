  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a public health problem. In recent years, oncology has been revolutionized with the&#xD;
      advent of new treatments for different tumor models, mainly immunotherapy directed against&#xD;
      cell cycle control points. Numerous inhibitory pathways are incorporated into the immune&#xD;
      system to maintain tolerance and homeostasis, and these are collectively known as&#xD;
      immunological checkpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main function of immunological checkpoints is to protect tissues from damage when the&#xD;
      immune system is responding to pathogens and maintain tolerance to self antigens (ie, prevent&#xD;
      autoimmunity). This is mainly achieved by down-regulation of T cell activation or effector&#xD;
      functions. There is increasing evidence to show that a primary mechanism by which tumors&#xD;
      evade the immune system is through the participation of immunological checkpoints. This has&#xD;
      stimulated the development of many novel agents that modulate immunological checkpoints or&#xD;
      other costimulatory receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTLA-4 is the first receptor of the checkpoint that is successfully selected as&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, was the first immunological&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor to receive FDA approval for the treatment of advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, PD-1 is another receptor for the immune control point, and its ligands,&#xD;
      the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, also resulted in important therapeutic&#xD;
      advances in cancer immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike CTLA-4, PD-1 is widely expressed and can be found in, in addition to T cells, in B&#xD;
      cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The main function of PD-1 is to limit the activity of T&#xD;
      cells in peripheral tissues during an inflammatory immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumors can exploit this control point, expressing the ligand PD-L1 and generating that&#xD;
      the cytotoxic T lymphocytes and the NK cells are anergic and incapable of killing. This&#xD;
      up-regulation mechanism of PD-L1 is known in tumors such as melanoma, lung and ovary. Several&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies directed to PD-1 have already received approvals for their clinical use&#xD;
      as Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab.&#xD;

      The toxic effect of cytostatics (chemotherapy) at the gonadal level is known, but the effect&#xD;
      that anti PD-1 immunotherapy can have on the spermogram of oncological patients at the level&#xD;
      of the blood-testicular barrier, endocrine axis, among others, is not known. The&#xD;
      proinflammatory mechanisms of immunotherapy could incur in damage evidenced as&#xD;
      quali-quantitative alterations of the spermogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the difference in spermogram (counting, functionality, vitality, mobility) before&#xD;
      and after treatment with anti-PD1 immunotherapy first line of oncological treatment of adult&#xD;
      patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the association adjusted for nutrition, endocrine disorders. Evaluate modifications&#xD;
      in the sexual functionality of patients through validated sexuality questionnaires before and&#xD;
      during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of information, according to the results obtained, cryopreservation prior to&#xD;
      the start of treatment could be taken into consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Observational prospective cohort with a single group. With start of follow-up from&#xD;
      the oncological diagnosis of patients who are in the process of starting treatment with&#xD;
      immunotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors in first line setting. The spermogram samples will be&#xD;
      performed: 2 baseline before the start of the drug and +/- 5 days of the start of the&#xD;
      treatment, separated by at least 2 weeks. Subsequent samples will be taken 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      after the start of treatment.&#xD;
