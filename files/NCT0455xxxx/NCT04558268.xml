      For many years there is a lack of large randomized controlled trials that study the effect of&#xD;
      low dose prednisone in women with RPL and thus the evidence of a probable efficacy of&#xD;
      prednisone in RPL women remains limited and unclear. As the ESHRE recommended in 2018 (2) we&#xD;
      aim to assess the effect of such treatment in a large trial that includes unexplained and&#xD;
      abnormal autoimmune profile RPL patients. we also aim to assess the side effects of the&#xD;
      treatment in RPL pregnant women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) was defined recently by the European society of human&#xD;
      reproduction and embryology (ESHRE) as the loss of two or more pregnancies that occur after&#xD;
      spontaneous conception and assisted reproductive technology excluding ectopic, molar&#xD;
      pregnancies and implantation failure (1,2). The exact prevalence of RPL is difficult to&#xD;
      estimate but most studies including the American society for reproductive medicine (ASRM)&#xD;
      repost that RPL affects 5% of women. In approximately half of the women with RPL the etiology&#xD;
      will remain unexplained while in the remaining half the cause will be defined as one or more&#xD;
      of the following, genetic factors, anatomic factors, endocrine factors, autoimmune and&#xD;
      infectious (1,3-6). 15% of patients with RPL are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome&#xD;
      which is considered as an autoimmune disease (7,8). The ESHRE and ASRM guidelines recommend&#xD;
      treatment of prophylactic doses of unfractionated heparin and low-dose aspirin for RPL women&#xD;
      with high titers of antiphospholipid antibodies. For RPL women with the remaining&#xD;
      immunological conditions glucocorticosteroids, IvIg , TNF inhibitors, and G-CSF treatment are&#xD;
      not evidence-based but can be given in research context (1,4,8). Glucocorticosteroids are&#xD;
      drugs that reduce inflammation by blocking the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. They&#xD;
      suppress the activity of T cells and decrease cytokines levels- IL6, IL1β, TNFα. This drug is&#xD;
      a known treatment for inflammatory diseases including asthma, Crohn's disease, and rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (9,10). In a recent review in 2017 Bandoli et al (11) summarized that&#xD;
      corticosteroids are often necessary to control the symptoms of various medical conditions in&#xD;
      pregnancy, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease. Investigations into adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes following&#xD;
      corticosteroid exposure have lacked adequate exploration into confounding by disease or&#xD;
      disease severity. The evidence for cleft palate alone is not sufficient to summarize. The&#xD;
      estimated risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate from corticosteroid exposure has&#xD;
      weakened over time, and no study published after 2003 has reported a statistically&#xD;
      significant risk estimate. This review does not find sufficient evidence to support an&#xD;
      increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, or preeclampsia following systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroid use in pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids are linked to gestational diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a few studies were conducted with different protocols to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      steroid therapy on women with RPL. Eight studies had reported a positive effect of prednisone&#xD;
      on live birth rate. Hasegawa et al (12) found a significantly effective live birth rate of&#xD;
      76.5% compared to 8.3% (p&lt;0.01) in 17 treated RPL patients with antiphospholipid antibody&#xD;
      with Prednisolone (40 mg/day) as soon as pregnancy was diagnosed, for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
      together with low dose Aspirin (81 mg/day) until delivery, and 12 untreated patients&#xD;
      respectively. They also found decreased antiphospholipid antibody titer and lower IUGR rate&#xD;
      in the study group (30.8% compared to 83.3%, p&lt;0.05). Reznikoff et al (13) reported on the&#xD;
      influence of steroid therapy combined with low dose Aspirin on the live birth rate in RPL&#xD;
      autoantibody negative pregnant women. In his study he found a 90.7% live birth rate among 214&#xD;
      women treated with Prednisone (20 mg/day) in the first trimester only and low dose Aspirin&#xD;
      (100 mg/day) for 7 months, compared with 74.6% birth rate among 63 women receiving aspirin&#xD;
      alone (p&lt;0.001). Bansal et al (14) claimed in his review that a combination of Prednisone&#xD;
      with low-dose aspirin can be efficient in preventing RPL, mainly in the first trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy, especially in women with non-APAS autoimmunity. Ogasawara et al (15) reported&#xD;
      about a birth of a healthy baby to a woman who experienced 10 unexplained first trimester&#xD;
      miscarriages after receiving intra-uterine Prednisolone (8 mg of 2 ml of solumedrol) 2-3 days&#xD;
      before ovulation and aspirin (40 mg/day) from 4 until 36 weeks of gestation. Gomaa et al (16)&#xD;
      reported an ongoing pregnancy beyond 20 weeks of gestation in 70.3 % of women in the&#xD;
      prednisolone treatment group and only 9.2% in the placebo group. In three different studies,&#xD;
      Quenby et al have shown a positive effect of steroid therapy on reducing the number of&#xD;
      uterine NK cells (from 14% before treatment to 9% after, p=0.0004) by given Prednisone (20&#xD;
      mg/day, from day 1 to 21 of the menstrual cycle) to 28 women with RPL and high number of&#xD;
      uterine NK cells(17). She reported about a birth of a healthy baby to a woman that suffered&#xD;
      from 19 consecutive miscarriages after receiving prednisolone (20 mg/day) for 6 months prior&#xD;
      to conception until 5 weeks gestation(18). In a latest study, a 60% and 40% live birth rate&#xD;
      was reported in a small treatment and placebo group respectively both with no pregnancy&#xD;
      complications nor serious adverse fetal outcomes, although the results weren't statistically&#xD;
      significant (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three studies have shown a probable positive effect of prednisone on birth life rate but have&#xD;
      reported complications. Tempefar et al (20)reported 77% and 35% live birth rates in a 52 RPL&#xD;
      women group who received a combination of Prednisone (20 mg/day), Progesterone (20 mg/day)&#xD;
      for the first 12 weeks, Aspirin (100 mg/day) until 38 weeks of gestation and Folic-acid (5&#xD;
      mg) every second day throughout the pregnancy, and in a 52 RPL women control group&#xD;
      respectively. Complications including nausea, depression, and tachycardia were observed.&#xD;
      Cushing's disease and IUGR were not observed, neither a difference of mean birth weight nor&#xD;
      preterm birth rate. Kumar et al (21)suggested that steroid therapy restricted to the&#xD;
      preconception and early pregnancy for women with non-APAS autoimmunity may improve the&#xD;
      outcome of the pregnancy. However, Kumar noted that steroid therapy during pregnancy is&#xD;
      associated with a higher risk for preterm labor secondary to rupture of membranes and to the&#xD;
      development of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Wang et al (22) who used high doses&#xD;
      Prednisone (40-50 mg/day), reported on the increased risk of preterm labor and recommended&#xD;
      not to used high doses prednisone for RPL women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two studies didn't show improvement of steroid therapy in the outcome of pregnancy. Laskin et&#xD;
      al (23) published a study on 773 women with RPL and autoantibodies (antinuclear, anti-DNA,&#xD;
      antilymphocyte, anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant antibodies). The women were divided&#xD;
      into treatment group (received high dose Prednisone 0.5-0.8 mg/kg/day + Aspirin 100 mg/day)&#xD;
      and to a placebo group. No significant difference in live birth was reported between the two&#xD;
      groups. However, preterm labor (62% and 12%, p&lt;0.01), hypertension (13%&amp;5%, p=0.05) and&#xD;
      gestational diabetes (15%&amp;5%, p=0.02) were more common in the treatment group. Empson et al&#xD;
      (24) reviewed the influence of prednisone and aspirin treatment for RPL women with&#xD;
      antiphospholipid antibody or lupus anticoagulant. He reported higher rates of prematurity and&#xD;
      gestational diabetes in the steroid treatment group without an improvement in pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarise for many years there is a lack of large randomized controlled trials that study&#xD;
      the effect of low dose prednisone in women with RPL and thus the evidence of a probable&#xD;
      efficacy of prednisone in RPL women remains limited and unclear. As the ESHRE recommended in&#xD;
      2018 (2) we aim to assess the effect of such treatment in a large trial that includes&#xD;
      unexplained and abnormal autoimmune profile RPL patients. we also aim to assess the side&#xD;
      effects of the treatment in RPL pregnant women.&#xD;
