      A study looking at the feasibility of doing a full-scale RCT that investigates the use of&#xD;
      tranexamic acid intravesically prior to continuous bladder irrigation treatment in the&#xD;
      emergency department for urinary retention due to clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to know:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient experience and acceptability of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study procedures (recruitment, site appropriateness, staff engagement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  safety data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify resource use&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary retention due to high clot burden is a common and resource-intensive condition.&#xD;
      Patients who have recently had prostate surgery or who have bladder cancer can often present&#xD;
      with urinary retention due to clots. Currently, the standard treatment for hematuria and clot&#xD;
      retention that has led to urinary retention is continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBI treatment is a nursing intensive procedure that is associated with lengthy hospital stays&#xD;
      for the patient. CBI treatment is a catheter inserted into the urethral opening that allows a&#xD;
      continuous flow of irrigation fluid into and out of the bladder. Initial manual irrigation of&#xD;
      clots is also a part of the standard of care. Catheter insertion is a painful procedure, and&#xD;
      there is distress during treatment as patients are confined to bed and experience discomfort&#xD;
      related to the catheter blockage. CBI treatment may be discontinued as the urine clears of&#xD;
      blood only to have it restarted as new clots form. CBI treatment requires a high level of&#xD;
      nursing resources as the irrigation fluid must be regularly changed and removed. It also&#xD;
      tends to require multiple episodes of manual irrigation by the nurse when it becomes blocked.&#xD;
      The procedure is not only distressing and invasive for the patient, but also takes away&#xD;
      resources from other patients. The procedure is labor intensive for nursing staff as it&#xD;
      requires constant monitoring and frequent episodes of lengthy manual clot irrigation&#xD;
      resulting in nursing resource strain and neglect of other patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been recent interest in adding antifibrinolytics, such as tranexamic acid (TXA), to&#xD;
      the standard treatment protocol to stop hematuria and clot retention and thereby decrease&#xD;
      patient and staff burden and improve outcomes. TXA is a synthetic lysine analog that prevents&#xD;
      the breakdown of clots and facilitates clot stabilization to promote tissue healing. It&#xD;
      intervenes at the end of the coagulation pathway to promote clot stabilization. The bladder&#xD;
      and prostate are prone to clot breakdown and therefore hematuria, as their tissue naturally&#xD;
      promotes clot breakdown. For this reason, TXA has been used extensively in urological&#xD;
      surgeries to prevent bleeding complications and has demonstrated effectiveness with an&#xD;
      excellent safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, TXA was given either orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously. However, there&#xD;
      is increasing interest in using TXA topically due to a decreased systemic absorption of TXA&#xD;
      compared to oral or intravenous use. Our team is interested in exploring the effect TXA has&#xD;
      when administered intravesically - i.e., instilled directly into the bladder. Specifically,&#xD;
      we are proposing the use of TXA directly into the bladder to obtain preliminary data about&#xD;
      the effects on the clinical course of patients requiring CBI treatment for hematuria and clot&#xD;
      retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 22-24F three-way Foley catheter will be inserted as per standard nursing protocols, and the&#xD;
      treating nurse will manually irrigate the bladder to remove as many clots as possible upon&#xD;
      catheter insertion before TXA instillation. One gram of TXA will be mixed with 100 ml of&#xD;
      normal saline, then directly instilled into the bladder via the catheter. The catheter will&#xD;
      be clamped with the medication in-situ for 15 minutes to allow the medication to have&#xD;
      sufficient time in contact with the bladder tissue. After 15 minutes, the catheter will be&#xD;
      unclamped, and CBI treatment will be carried out as per standard treatment.&#xD;
