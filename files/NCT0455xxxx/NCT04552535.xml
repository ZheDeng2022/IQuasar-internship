      This study aims to characterize the profile and outcomes for patients with Squamous Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma of the Lung (SqCC) who progress on 1L pembrolizumab in combination with platinum&#xD;
      based chemotherapy and receive afatinib as second line (2L) therapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Time on Treatment With Afatinib or Chemotherapy During Second Line (2L) Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of second-line treatment until discontinuation of second-line treatment, up to 12.3 months for afatinib treated and up to 7.5 months for chemotherapy treated patients</time_frame>
    <description>Time on treatment was defined as the interval from the start of second-line treatment until discontinuation of second-line treatment for any reason, e.g. toxicity, progression, death, patient choice. The end of 2L treatment was defined as the date of last treatment order for afatinib plus the days of supply on the last known treatment order up to the date of data collection (but not exceeding). The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate the median and 95% confidence interval for time on treatment.</description>

The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate the median and 95% confidence interval for time on treatment. Patients treated with afatinib were analysed for their histology status and categorized into a squamous cell - or mixed histology treatment group.</description>

    <time_frame>From the start of second-line treatment to the end of follow-up, up to 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Chart abstractors (i.e. the patients treating physician) were asked to abstract information regarding severe (grade 3 or higher) irAEs of specific interest (including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, interstitial lung disease, higher indeterminate pulmonary events, death, or discontinuation of therapy due to toxicity) during first line (1L) treatment and second line (2L) for both patients treated with afatinib in 2L and those treated with chemotherapy in 2L. Providers/abstractors were asked only if these specific immune related events occurred.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This retrospective, non-interventional, multi-site cohort study utilized existing data from the electronic medical records of patients with advanced or metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SqCC) of the lung treated with first-line pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, followed by second-line afatinib or chemotherapy.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients (pts) aged ≥18 years, initiated first-line (1L) pembrolizumab and platinum-based combination chemotherapy (CT) after 1st June 2018, and subsequently discontinued 1L therapy. All pts had started second-line treatment with either afatinib or any CT at least 3 months prior to date of data collection. Maximum follow-up for any pts was approx 15 months. Pts were excluded if they had received pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-based CT as part of an interventional clinical trial.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) is used by doctors and researchers to assess how a participant's disease is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living activities of the participant and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. 0 = Fully Active (Most Favorable Activity); 1 = Restricted activity but ambulatory; 2 = Ambulatory but unable to carry out work activities; 3 = Limited Self-Care; 4 = Completely Disabled, No self-care (Least Favorable Activity)</description>

          <title>Tumor stage at initial diagnosis</title>
          <description>Disease stage means how big tumor is + how far it has spread. They range from 0 (not spread) to IV (spread throughout body). 0 - cancer not spread beyond inner lining of affected organ; I - is small and not spread to lymph nodes (LN); II - spread to some LN near original tumor; III - spread to nearby tissue or spread to far away LN (IIIA: heterogeneous group with diversity of tumor characteristics and varying degrees of LN involvement; IIIB: involves LN on opposite side of chest or above collar bone, or heart or trachea + LN in chest center or near windpipe); IV - has spread to other organs.</description>
