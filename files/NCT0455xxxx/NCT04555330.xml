    <textblock>
      Research show that inactivity during hospitalization is the norm and that the negative&#xD;
      effects on muscle mass and the fitness of the patient will take a long time and hard work to&#xD;
      recover afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Especially for weaker elderly patients, just a few days in bed could mean that they are not&#xD;
      able to take care of themselves afterwards, with increased care expenses and increased risk&#xD;
      of relapse as a consequence. Even though this is known, the work to motivate patients to be&#xD;
      active during their hospitalization is limited to few training sessions with only the most&#xD;
      vulnerable patients. No tools are today available for objectively tracking and motivating&#xD;
      patients to be active during their stay. Having such a professional tool would not only&#xD;
      motivate but also shift the attention of the health professionals towards the importance of&#xD;
      physical activity in the treatment of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the studys is to investigate if patients hospitalised for medical disease will&#xD;
      increase their time spent out of bed during hospitalisation through simple visual feedback&#xD;
      about physical activities from a mobile bedside device.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted as a quasi-randomised trial using a large tertiary public&#xD;
      hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. Patients admitted to Department of Respiratory Medicine (2&#xD;
      wards), Department of Cardiology, and Department of Geriatrics will be included, and they&#xD;
      will have their physical activity level measured either with or without a bedside monitor&#xD;
      providing visual feedback of time spent bedridden, sitting, standing and walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have their physical activity measured during hospitalisation.&#xD;
      Approximately half of the participants will receive visual feedback about the amount of&#xD;
      physical activity from a mobile device placed on the bedside table.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The allocation of participants will be done in 8 waves at each of the participating wards. At each hospital ward, 4 of the waves will be allocated to the control group and 4 to the intervention group. The order of the conditions is randomised.&#xD;
A participant will be assigned to the wave that the ward is allocated to at the time of admission.&#xD;
The wave size for each ward is set to 10 patients.&#xD;
Assignment of the waves at each department will be determined before any recruitment by means of Latin square randomisation in 2 blocks of 4 waves at the 4 participating wards.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>To assess physical activity two small tri-axial accelerometers embedded in medical Band-Aids will be used. The accelerometers are discretely worn on the lateral aspect of the thigh.&#xD;
The accelerometers sample accelerations continuously during hospitalisation and are connected wirelessly to a tablet that via an inbuilt algorithm classify the recordings as bedridden (lying down), sitting, standing, and walking.</description>
