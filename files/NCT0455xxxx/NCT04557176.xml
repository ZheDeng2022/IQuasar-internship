  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected people have an increased risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). To reduce&#xD;
      the burden of TB among people living with HIV (PLHIV), the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      recommends systematic TB screening followed by 1) confirmatory TB testing for all those who&#xD;
      screen positive and 2) TB preventive therapy (TPT) for all TPT-eligible PLHIV who screen&#xD;
      negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the TB Screening Improves Preventive Therapy Uptake (TB SCRIPT) trial is to&#xD;
      determine whether TB screening based on C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, measured using a&#xD;
      rapid and low-cost point-of-care (POC) assay, improves TPT uptake and clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      PLHIV, relative to symptom-based TB screening.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the TB SCRIPT trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of POC CRP-based TB screening, which is the next step required for&#xD;
      successful scale-up of both systematic TB screening and TPT. The study's central hypothesis&#xD;
      is that compared to symptom-based TB screening, a TB screening strategy based on CRP levels&#xD;
      measured at the point-of-care will improve TPT uptake, thereby reducing TB incidence and its&#xD;
      associated mortality among PLHIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct an individual randomized control&#xD;
      trial enrolling PLHIV presenting to clinics in Uganda for routine antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (ART) initiation. Eligible participants will be randomized to either POC CRP-based TB&#xD;
      screening (intervention arm) or symptom-based TB screening (control arm). In both arms,&#xD;
      screen-positive participants will undergo confirmatory TB testing; participants found to have&#xD;
      prevalent TB will be initiated on standard TB treatment. In both arms, screen-negative&#xD;
      participants will be assessed for TPT eligibility; TPT-eligible participants will be&#xD;
      initiated on standard TPT. All participants will be followed for 2 years.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Masking will be maintained by administering finger prick tests to all participants, irrespective of trial arm. Intervention arm participants will have CRP levels measured from blood obtained by finger prick. Control arm participants will have beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) levels measured from blood obtained by finger prick.&#xD;
Only participants, study investigators and routine clinical care providers will be masked. Study staff performing TB screening in accordance with the participant's randomization assignment and activities downstream of TB screening (i.e., confirmatory TB testing, TPT eligibility assessment) will not be masked. The database administrator will have access to the randomized assignments.</masking_description>

    <description>CRP is a non-specific marker of inflammation whose levels rise in the setting of interleukin 6 (IL-6)-mediated inflammation, such as active TB. In clinical settings, CRP is used to identify patients with systemic inflammation from infection or non-infectious cases. In settings with high TB prevalence, the investigators hypothesize that CRP can be used to accurately screen individuals for active TB (i.e., distinguish individuals with high likelihood of having active TB from those individuals unlikely to have active TB).</description>
