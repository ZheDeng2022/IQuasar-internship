  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial to evaluate the effects of a community-based intervention on&#xD;
      increasing cervical cancer screening rates in underserved Korean and Vietnamese American&#xD;
      women. All women will receive an educational program and navigation assistance. Women in the&#xD;
      intervention condition will also receive a self-sampling kit for self-collection of a&#xD;
      cervical sample for HPV testing. The investigators will evaluate whether the inclusion of a&#xD;
      self-sampling kit increases the proportion of Asian American women who participate in&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: Compare rates of providing a self-collected sample vs. obtaining clinic-based&#xD;
      screening among 800 Asian American women. It is hypothesized that the proportion of women in&#xD;
      the HPV self-sampling program who provide a self-collected sample will be higher than the&#xD;
      proportion of women in the clinic-based program who obtain clinic-based screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine mediators of participation. The investigators will examine both individual-&#xD;
      and social/environmental-level factors associated with participation across both programs. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that higher levels of perceived self-efficacy, lower levels of embarrassment,&#xD;
      and fewer barriers will be associated with higher rates of participation in both conditions.&#xD;
      Further, it is hypothesized that women in the HPV self-sampling program will report greater&#xD;
      self-efficacy, less embarrassment, and fewer barriers compared to women in the clinic-based&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess the relative cost-effectiveness of HPV self-sampling vs. clinic-based&#xD;
      screening. The investigators will conduct an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis from a&#xD;
      societal perspective incorporating trial-based direct medical and participant-borne costs&#xD;
      associated with HPV self-sampling vs. clinic-based screening. It is hypothesized that the&#xD;
      self-sampling program will be less costly to implement and achieve a higher participation&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
