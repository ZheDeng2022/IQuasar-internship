  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if stimulation of the brain can improve memory. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a device called transcranial magnetic stimulation that can stimulate&#xD;
      and activate a specific part of the brain that is important for memory. The study will enroll&#xD;
      MCI subjects who will be randomly assigned to receive active or sham brain stimulation.&#xD;
      'Blinded' or 'sham-controlled' means that the subject will not know whether the treatment&#xD;
      they receive is the active treatment or the non-active stimulation. In the 'sham' condition,&#xD;
      the stimulator will turn on but will not actually be stimulating the target brain region.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 and 2) before the first treatment, and after the last treatment (Day 17 and 18)</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal memory will be measured using a free recall task where participants learn a list of everyday words and are asked to recall as many words as they can remember after a period of distraction. Proportion of recollected words will be used to quantify memory performance changes.</description>

    <measure>Object recognition memory performance change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 and 2) before the first treatment, and after the last treatment (Day 17 and 18)</time_frame>
    <description>Object memory will be measured using an recognition task where participants view photos of everyday objects and are asked to identify them as OLD or NEW during a memory test wherein unseen novel objects and very similar but new photos of identical objects are shown. Recollection and discrimination index will be used to quantify memory performance changes.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) before the first treatment and after the last treatment (Day 18)</time_frame>
    <description>Sequence memory will be tested using the Picture Sequence Memory Test from the NIH Toolbox wherein pictures are shown in a specific order after which participants will be asked to remember the learned pictures in the previously presented sequence.</description>
