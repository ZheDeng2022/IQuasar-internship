  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized placebo controlled study to test the efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD)&#xD;
      as a treatment for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Subjects, 120 in total,&#xD;
      will be males and females with PTSD, half of which will have comorbid mild traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (TBI). There will be three study arms, each with 40 subjects: 1) Oral CBD 400 mg&#xD;
      daily; 2) Oral CBD 800 mg daily, and 3) Placebo daily. Treatment duration will be 8 weeks.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be change in PTSD symptoms as measured by change in the&#xD;
      Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) total score.&#xD;
