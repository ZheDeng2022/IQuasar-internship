  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this grant is to create and test a mobile app to support ART adherence among&#xD;
      HIV+ African American adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase II project will enhance the existing (Phase 1) mobile intervention by offering: 1)&#xD;
      a two-way communication capability through which participants can: i) indicate &quot;pill taken&quot;&#xD;
      in response to pill reminders, and ii) receive a positive visual icon as behavioral-economics&#xD;
      based reinforcement for &quot;pill taken&quot; responses; 2) pharmacist counseling and medication&#xD;
      support; and, 3) the addition of educational and motivational text messages. Overall aims are&#xD;
      to: 1) expand mhealth intervention to incorporate new Phase II features; 2) evaluate&#xD;
      effectiveness in an RCT of HIV+ African Americans; and 3) prepare marketing and&#xD;
      commercialization plans. Our long-term goal is to increase ART medication adherence, thus&#xD;
      decreasing health disparities, among HIV+, African-Americans.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported ART medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence was assessed using a 3-item self-report measure examining ART use in the prior 7 days, a time period, which is considered a reliable indictor of overall adherence (Bianco et al., 2010; Kleeburger et al., 2001; Segeral et al., 2010; Spire et al. 2008). The measure consists of a yes or no response to each of the following three questions: (i) &quot;did you miss any ART doses during the last four days?,&quot; (ii) &quot;Were you late for any of your intakes by more than two hours during the last four days?,&quot; and (iii) &quot;did you miss any ART doses last week-end?&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HIV medication adherence self efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>HIV treatment self-efficacy was assessed using the 17-item self-efficacy belief subscale of the modified HIV Medication Taking Self-Efficacy Scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Stress burden will be assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1983), a well-validated instrument used with diverse populations.</description>
