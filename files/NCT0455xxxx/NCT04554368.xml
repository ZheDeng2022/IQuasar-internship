  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study sought to develop and validate a new risk stratification score (Henan predicting&#xD;
      the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage score, Henan-PRIHS) based on intra-arterial contrast&#xD;
      enhanced Flat Detector CT (IA-CEFDCT) to predict symptomatic intra-cerebral hemorrhage (sICH)&#xD;
      after stroke thrombectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Henan-PRIHS was developed from 95 patients who underwent IA-CEFDCT and MT for acute&#xD;
      anterior stroke. Patients were classified as having one of three grades according to the&#xD;
      presence of contrast filling within the occluded vascular territory. Grade 0 was normal or&#xD;
      less contrast filling in affected hemisphere, grade 1 and 2 were small and medium-large area&#xD;
      without contrast filling, respectively. The Youden index was used to determine the optimum no&#xD;
      contrast filling area cutoff for defining grade 1 and 2. The score was subsequently validated&#xD;
      in a different population of 208 patients and compared with three established scores.&#xD;

    <description>After femoral artery puncture, FDCT scan (if necessary) and IA-CEFDCT scan were performed on a single flat-detector angiography system (Allura Xper FD20, Philips Medical systems, Best, the Netherlands), respectively. FDCT was acquired with the following acquisition parameters: 20s rotation, 220° rotation, 617 single frames at a frame rate of 30/s, 48cm detector field of view, 1024 acquisition matrix. Images were reconstructed using a soft-tissue kernel with an isotropic voxel size of 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 mm on a dedicated workstation for FPCT data (XperCT Dual 3.2.0). For image analysis, these isotropic FDCT data were viewed in the axial plane with 5 mm slice thickness.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. age ≥18 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. occlusion of internal carotid artery and/or middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 or M2&#xD;
             segments confirmed by CTA or MRA or DSA,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥ 4 points,&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. MT was performed within 9 hours from stroke onset,&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. baseline CT scan and IA-CEFDCT scan must be performed; 24 hours post-treatment CT scan&#xD;
             was done and when the patient's neurological state had deteriorated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. bilateral infarcts,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. history of stroke,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. post-procedure ICH (including SAH) due to iatrogenic complications,&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. missing clinical and demographic data,&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. poor-quality IA-CEFDCT scans (i.e., motion artifact) that limited accurate&#xD;
             identification of the region of interest. Bridge treatment (combined intravenous&#xD;
             thrombolysis with MT) was not excluded from this study.&#xD;
