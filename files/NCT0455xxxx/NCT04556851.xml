    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of HSK7653 (as monotherapy) compared with&#xD;
      placebo after 24 weeks, and the safety (up to 52 weeks) of HSK7653 in Chinese patients with&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes who are insufficient glycaemic control with diet and exercise.&#xD;

      The treatment period is composed of a 24-week double-blind period (week 1-24) and a 28-week&#xD;
      open-label period (week 25-52). During the double-blind period, participants will receive 10&#xD;
      mg or 25 mg dose of HSK7653 and matching placebo, or placebo only. During the open-label&#xD;
      period, all participants will receive 25 mg dose of HSK7653.&#xD;
