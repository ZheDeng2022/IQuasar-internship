    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized,double-blind,placebo-controlled, investigation to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and the potential immunological reaction of single of&#xD;
      NL005 administered intravenously to healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1A, Seven (7) cohorts of subjects (first two cohorts 2 subjects respectively, 10&#xD;
      subjects per cohort for next 5 cohorts) will administered one dose of NL005 or placebo in a&#xD;
      4:1 ratio. Dosing start at 0.05μg/kg and advance to 0.25, 0.5, 2, 5, 12.5, 25μg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NL005 or placebo administered as a single dose on Day 1. Safety parameters recorded on Study&#xD;
      Days 1, 2, 5, 14, and 28. Evaluation of adverse events performed throughout the study.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic samples obtained on Study Day 1. Blood samples collected for serum antibody&#xD;
      determinations at Screening , Days 14 and 28.&#xD;

    <description>Determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) by comprehensive evaluation of drug safety by adverse event observation, vital signs, physical examination, laboratory examination, electrocardiogram, etc. In this study, DLT was defined as liver, kidney, heart and mental nervous system toxicity of level 2 or above or blood system toxicity of level 3 or above and other systemic adverse events occurred within 14 days after drug administration, and the adverse events were judged to be related to the experimental drug use.If more than 3 (including 3) DLT cases are present in any dose group, the test should be terminated. The previous dose of this dose is considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</description>
