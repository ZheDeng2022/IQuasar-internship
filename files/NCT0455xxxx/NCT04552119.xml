      This study evaluates the safety of the HEALICOIL Knotless Suture Anchors in patients&#xD;
      requiring a repair of the rotator cuff tendon repair&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, post-marketing, observational, case series study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the HEALICOIL Knotless Suture Anchors in subjects with&#xD;
      rotator cuff tendon repair. Approximately 160 subjects will be enrolled at up to 6 sites.&#xD;
      Safety monitoring will include documentation device- and surgery-related AEs. Efficacy will&#xD;
      be monitored by assessment of post-operative follow up, clinical complications, reoperation&#xD;
      rate, EQ-5D-5L, and pain VAS.&#xD;

    <description>Repair failure rate defined as the need for a second repair procedure at 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Repair failure rate at 12 months and 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Repair failure rate is defined as the need for a second repair procedure. Repair rate at 24 months will be collected for the HEALICOIL Knotless REGENESORB Non-Self Tapping subgroup only.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant-Murley Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Constant-Murley Shoulder (CMS) scale assesses four aspects related to shoulder pathology; two subjective: pain and activities of daily living (ADL) and two objective: range of motion (ROM) and strength. The subjective components can receive up to 35 points and the objective 65, resulting in a possible maximum total score of 100 points (best function). Pain and ADL are answered by the subject; ROM and strength require a physical evaluation and are answered by the orthopaedic surgeon or the physiotherapist.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES instrument is composed of 2 sections containing participant self-reported and clinician assessments. The ASES score is a 0 to 100-point rating with a higher score indicating improvement in pain and function. It is based solely on participant responses and is a combination of the participant's shoulder pain rating (VAS Pain) and self-reported ability to perform 10 different activities of daily living (ADLs).</description>

    <measure>Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) Shoulder scale at 6 months and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SANE is a simple, single-question, patient-based shoulder function assessment tool: ''How would you rate your shoulder today as a percentage of normal (0% to 100% scale with 100% being normal)?''</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-3L at 6 months and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D-3L is a descriptive system measuring health-related Quality Of Life (QOL) and consists of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which takes one of three responses. The responses record three levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D-3L dimension.</description>

&#xD;
               1. Known hypersensitivity to the implant material. Where material sensitivity is&#xD;
                  suspected, appropriate tests should be made and sensitivity ruled out prior to&#xD;

                  secure fixation by suture.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  support or retard healing&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. The presence of infection.&#xD;

                  (30) days of Visit 1, or during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Women who are pregnant.&#xD;
