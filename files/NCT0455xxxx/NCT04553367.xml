      age group between 18-65 years, intubated and ventilated patients due to respiratory failure&#xD;
      from severe lung infection and/or traumatic lung contusion [respiratory failure was diagnosed&#xD;
      by arterial blood gases (ABG) with partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) ≤60 mmHg, partial&#xD;
      pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)≥60 mmHg, PH &gt; 7.30, respiratory rate &gt;25 min]. All&#xD;
      patients ventilated for 4 days with CMV with respiratory rate 12/min, PEEP 5 cm/H2O, FIO2&#xD;
      adjusted to maintain arterial oxygen saturation above 90%. And sedated with both fentanyl and&#xD;
      midazolam intravenous infusion to adjust sedation level to achieve Richmond&#xD;
      Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) -2 to -3 as illustrated in table. All patients received broad&#xD;
      spectrum antibiotics in form of meropenem 1 gm slowly intravenous every 8 hours in this&#xD;
      period (four days) and a qualitative sputum culture collected from all patients after 3 days&#xD;
      from ventilation. Feeding started on the second day of ventilation to all patients through&#xD;
      feeding pump at rate of 70 ml insure plus (Abbot company) with 1.47 kilo-calorie/ml to supply&#xD;
      patients with approximately 2500 kilo-calorie in 24 hours calculated by approximately 35&#xD;
      kilo-calorie/kg. The 5 points of bundle for pneumonia prevention were strictly applied to all&#xD;
      patients: Elevation of the head of the bed 30º to 45º, Daily evaluation for possible&#xD;
      ex-tubation, The use of endotracheal tube with subglottic secretion drainage, oral care with&#xD;
      oral antiseptics, initiation of safe enteral nutrition, within 24-48 hours from ICU admission&#xD;
      and ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 patients included in our study from those who showed no improvement and still had&#xD;
      respiratory failure and completed ventilation for 4 days and fulfilled &gt; 2 parameters on SOFA&#xD;
      score and &gt; 6 on pneumonia score and randomly allocated in two groups 100 patients in each.&#xD;
      Randomization sequence was created using Excel 2007 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) with a 1:1&#xD;
      allocation using random block sizes of 2 and 4 by an independent doctor. In this way,&#xD;
      sequence generation and type of randomization can be expressed at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients selected underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy on the same day. Sepsis&#xD;
      documented in our study by &gt; 2 on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. While VAP&#xD;
      documented in our study by &gt;6 on CPIS score. Only patients of group B had three times&#xD;
      bronchoscopy according to our protocol one at the end of first 5 days, second bronchoscopy at&#xD;
      the end of the second 5 days and last one at the end of the studied period to confirm both&#xD;
      clinical and bacteriological cure. Bronchoscopy done with the following precautions: we used&#xD;
      flexible bronchoscopy Olympus BF-160 adult size, patients kept sedated with both midazolam&#xD;
      and fentanyl infusion to get same sedation score mentioned before (RASS-2/-3), increase FIO2&#xD;
      to 100% during the procedure, use xylocaine spray 10% by Astra Zeneca company 2 puffs in each&#xD;
      nostril before application of the rubber tube of the bronchoscope, keep patient's head&#xD;
      elevated 20 degree during procedure, use CMV mode with previous mentioned parameters with&#xD;
      100% FIO2 during the procedure, 4 syringe of normal isotonic saline used for wash every one&#xD;
      10 ml and suction done immediately after injection, suction of the fluid and small airway&#xD;
      secretion after only the first injection of isotonic saline syringe used for BAL and sent for&#xD;
      qualitative culture and the other isotonic saline injected in the remaining three syringe&#xD;
      used only for wash the small airways and not for bacteriological sampling, monitoring of&#xD;
      patients during the procedure done by SPO2, non-invasive blood pressure measurement every 5&#xD;
      minutes, electro cardiac gram for heart rate, clinical assessment of depth of sedation every&#xD;
      5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study selected to be 2 weeks and evaluation of all patients in both groups&#xD;
      done on three periods, at the end of the first 5 days, at the end of the second 5 days and at&#xD;
      the end of last 4 days.&#xD;
