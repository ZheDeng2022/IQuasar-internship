    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled, single-armed and prospective study, patients with advanced malignant&#xD;
      solid tumors will be given with SL22P autologous CAR - T/CAR-TILs cells. The aim of the study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SL22P CAR-T cells, including the adverse reaction,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and the outcomes of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SL22P is a proprietary product of Senlang Biotechnology. The T cells may be isolated from the&#xD;
      peripheral blood or from the tumor tissue. The CAR-T/CAR-TILs cells contains a anti-CD22 CAR&#xD;
      structure and also carries a scFv fragment of anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody. After&#xD;
      autologous SL22P CAR-T/CAR-TILs cells were transplanted back into patients, CAR-T would&#xD;
      target CD22+B cells in the blood. This will promote the activation and amplification of CAR+&#xD;
      cells, and secrete anti-PD-L1 scFv outside the cells to regulate the immunity and enhance&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity. The CAR-TILs may reduce the severity of the adverse reactions than&#xD;
      conventional TILs, which result from the combination of high dose IL-2 infusion.&#xD;

        the group only after infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exit criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
        Withdrawal: This can be divided into investigator performed withdrawal and patient 's&#xD;
        voluntary withdrawal from the clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Withdrawal implemented by the investigator: When the patients meets the suspension&#xD;
             criteria specified in the protocol during the trial, such as: vital organ dysfunction,&#xD;
             drug allergic reaction, poor compliance, worsening of the disease, or serious adverse&#xD;
             reactions, it is necessary to stop the trial drug treatment or adopt other treatment&#xD;
             methods During treatment, the researcher asked the patients to withdraw from the&#xD;
             trial. Due to the differences of patients ' cells, there was a possibility that&#xD;
             insufficient number of CAR-T cell can't be prepared.Thus, the investigator judges that&#xD;
             the patient needs to withdraw from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient's withdrawal: such as poor efficacy, intolerance of adverse reactions, hope to&#xD;
             adopt other treatment methods, or voluntarily withdraw from the trial without any&#xD;
             reason&#xD;
