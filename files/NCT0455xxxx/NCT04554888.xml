  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this experiment the investigators would like to assess if papain induces an itch sensation&#xD;
      comparable to the itch sensation induced by cowhage and to confirm that the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of papain follows the non-histaminergic pathway.&#xD;

    <measure>Measuring itch intensity by computerized Visual Analog Scale Scoring</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects will rate the sensation of itch on a 100 mm VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100 where 0 indicates &quot;no itch&quot; and 100 indicates &quot;worst itch imaginable&quot; and similarly for sensations of stinging/pricking and burning, both of which are frequently associated with the sensation of itch.</description>

    <measure>Measuring Alloknesis</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Alloknesis is measured by using mildly pruritic, non-painful von Frey nylon filaments of a predetermined intensity (generally 5-30 milliNewton of force). This stimulator is applied 0.5 cm outside the area of itch provocation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of Cold Detection Thresholds (CDT)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The tests for thermal sensation will all be conducted using a PATHWAY ATS (Medoc Ltd, Israel) thermal sensory testing device. A thermode stimulator of 3x3 cm will be placed on the treated/placebo areas and kept in place by means of Velcro tape. During the first 8 seconds, the temperature decreases 1°C per second from a starting temperature of 32°C until the subject perceives a temperature change (cold sensation) and presses a button that will terminate the measurement and return the temperature to baseline at a rate of 5°C /s. A cut-off temperature of 0°C will be used.</description>

A thermode stimulator of 3x3 cm will be placed on the treated/placebo areas and kept in place by means of Velcro tape. During the first 8 seconds, the temperature raises 1°C per second from a starting temperature of 32°C until the subject detects a painful sensation and presses a button that will terminate the measurement and return the temperature to baseline at a rate of 5°C /s. A cut-off temperature of 52°C will be used.</description>

    <description>The tests will be conducted by using a PATHWAY ATS (Medoc Ltd, Israel) thermal sensory testing device. A thermode stimulator of 3x3 cm will be placed on the treated/placebo areas and kept in place by means of Velcro tape. The subjects will have to rate the pain to two suprathreshold heat pain stimuli (starting and ending at 32°C with an increase and decrease of 5°C and 3 s plateau at 50°C).</description>

    <description>During the session each forearm of the subject will be divided into four squared areas (2.5x2.5 cm), see Figure 4. Four of the areas will be treated with doxepin for 1 hour and 30 minutes (with a patch to deposit 1.2 grams of cream). Each patch will be covered with Tegaderm I.V., an occlusive, adhesive dressing (3M), for at least 1½ hours 48. At the end of the pre-treatment period, the patches will be removed and the skin will be cleaned with alcohol.</description>
