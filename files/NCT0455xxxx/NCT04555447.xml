  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Agavins are branched neo-fructans and prebiotic fiber found in Agave plants. In preclinical&#xD;
      studies, agavins have demonstrated an effect in reversing metabolic disorders associated to&#xD;
      overweight and obesity through the modulation of gut microbiota activity and composition,&#xD;
      showing their interesting potential in the context of high obesity and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases prevalence in Mexican population. However, current information about&#xD;
      gastrointestinal adaptation and effects of agavins intake in humans is scarce. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that increasing amounts of agavins up to 12 g/day, will be well tolerated by&#xD;
      healthy and obese adult participants, but with differences between these groups, modulating&#xD;
      gut microbiota activity and structure differentially, as well as the metabolic status after a&#xD;
      5-week dose-escalation intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diet has dramatically changed over the past decades with increased consumption of high-fat,&#xD;
      high-sugar, high-sodium processed and refined foods, but with low or very low fiber-rich&#xD;
      products. Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found for example in dietary fiber have&#xD;
      been recognized as crucial for the microbial ecosystem in the gut; the lack of these&#xD;
      available carbohydrates depletes the microbial community, causing alterations in its&#xD;
      composition and performance. Perturbations in the gut microbiota have been related with&#xD;
      several diseases, so as reduction in dietary fiber has been linked with an increased risk for&#xD;
      developing chronic diseases, namely cardiovascular and metabolic ones, such as obesity and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. Mexico is the second country with the highest obesity rates worldwide, which&#xD;
      represents a major national public health challenge. Interestingly, national nutrition&#xD;
      surveys have found that Mexican adults consume less than half the dietary intake&#xD;
      recommendation for fiber, along with an alarming statistic of 7 in 10 adults being overweight&#xD;
      or obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A change in dietary patterns intended to achieve adequate nutrient intake, dietary fiber&#xD;
      included, is one strategy that could help modify this nutrition trend in the country, but&#xD;
      another accessible alternative is the supplementation of prebiotic fiber, thus increasing&#xD;
      fiber consumption and avoiding gut microbiota alterations simultaneously. Prebiotics, such as&#xD;
      fructans, are substrates selectively used by gut microbes, modifying their activity and/or&#xD;
      community composition, and conferring health benefits to the host. Clinical research has&#xD;
      demonstrated their impact in reducing body weight, fat mass, hyperlipidemia, etc. Agave&#xD;
      prebiotics, also known as agavins, are fructan-type carbohydrates that possess a unique&#xD;
      molecular structure and are extracted as a complex multi-disperse mixture presenting&#xD;
      different degrees of polymerization and/or branching. Previously, agavins have shown to&#xD;
      induce weight loss, a significant reduction in glucose and total cholesterol levels, and&#xD;
      promotion of satiety-related hormones in overweight mice through the increment in short-chain&#xD;
      fatty acids (SCFA) and specific modulation of gut microbiota; more recently, fecal&#xD;
      metabolomics have revealed interesting microbial-derived metabolites, detected after agavins&#xD;
      supplementation in mouse models that could induce a beneficial effect on host health, but&#xD;
      more research is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experts have stated that differences in dietary fiber structure guide its degradation: which&#xD;
      microbes can metabolize these substrates, and the effects in the microbial community that&#xD;
      overall, impact health. Additionally, structural differences in prebiotic fibers like&#xD;
      agavins, may cause specific gastrointestinal (GI) adaptation and tolerance which is of great&#xD;
      importance to promote their consumption and in determining an ideal amount or dose to further&#xD;
      explore their impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we propose a double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel groups, dose-escalation&#xD;
      trial, where lean and obese subjects were assigned to either agavins or placebo group for a&#xD;
      5-week dose-escalation period. We aim to evaluate the evolution of GI tolerability and&#xD;
      compared the records between lean and obese participants (Mexican adults), the impact in gut&#xD;
      microbiota composition and activity through the determination of short-chain fatty acids and&#xD;
      fecal metabolites, and metabolic status, all of this after a short period of time proposed to&#xD;
      induce adaptation to agavins intake.&#xD;
