  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label pilot study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All patients&#xD;
      will receive SOFUSA Enbrel 25 mg once weekly. The dose will be increased to 50 mg if the dose&#xD;
      escalation criteria are met during the dose escalation phase of the study.&#xD;

      This study is a Phase 1b proof-of-concept, open-label study to assess the safety and pilot&#xD;
      efficacy of Enbrel administered by the Sofusa® DoseConnect™ delivery system (SOFUSA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with moderately to severe RA and an inadequate response to subcutaneous&#xD;
      (SC) Enbrel. SOFUSA Enbrel will be administered once weekly to patients for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients will start on an Enbrel dose of 25 mg during the induction phase of the study and&#xD;
      may be increased to an Enbrel dose of 50 mg during the dose escalation phase of the study&#xD;
      based on the dose escalation criteria. Patients will remain on either the 25 mg or 50 mg dose&#xD;
      for the final maintenance phase of the study.&#xD;
