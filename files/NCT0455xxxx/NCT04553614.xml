  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic inactivity related diseases including obesity, insulin resistance&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus has reached global epidemic proportions. Exercise training is a&#xD;
      clinically proven primary intervention that delays and in many cases prevents health burdens.&#xD;
      Therefore, many health authorities and local councils run exercise referral schemes for&#xD;
      individuals with elevated disease disk. However, a number of barriers to successful&#xD;
      completion of traditional exercise referral schemes exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the use of a home-based high intensity interval training&#xD;
      programme as a potential exercise referral scheme activity to overcome many of the barriers&#xD;
      to successful exercise referral scheme adherence and uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 people referred to the Active Sefton (Sefton Council) exercise referral scheme will be&#xD;
      recruited and randomised to one of the two exercise groups (existing Active Sefton Scheme gym&#xD;
      based training or home-based HIT). All participants will have access to the normal Active&#xD;
      Sefton support mechanisms, but the training programme followed will be different. Before and&#xD;
      after 12 weeks of training volunteers will participate in testing to assess changes in&#xD;
      aerobic fitness, physical activity, vascular function, insulin sensitivity, body composition&#xD;
      and psychological well-being. A 3 month follow up will also be completed to investigate the&#xD;
      long term consequences on these variables.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomisation - During the pre-intervention testing session participants will be randomised&#xD;
      to either the home-based HIT group (HB_HIT)(n=100) or Active Sefton Exercise Referral Scheme&#xD;
      (AS_ERS)(n=100). To control for the potential confounding effects of gender and location,&#xD;
      stratified randomisation will be completed. Randomisation will be completed with a random&#xD;
      number generator. Participant randomisation will take place during Pre-Intervention Testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment - Participants will be recruited via the AS_ERS. Following referral to the Active&#xD;
      Sefton Scheme by their GP, all patients will be sent an invitation letter by the Active&#xD;
      Sefton team. The research team will add a short letter outlining the study to patients. All&#xD;
      Patients who chose to participate in the Active Sefton Scheme will meet with an Active&#xD;
      Lifestyle Development Officer (LDO). During this session the LDO will discuss the study with&#xD;
      patients. Interested patients will be given a participant information sheet, and their&#xD;
      contact details (email and/or phone) will be given to the Liverpool John Moores University&#xD;
      (LJMU) research team. These details will be used to contact the patient to discuss the study&#xD;
      further. Should the patient still want to participate a Pre-Intervention Testing session will&#xD;
      be organised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients consent to the study the research team will inform Active Sefton with information&#xD;
      on the exercise programme the participant has been randomised too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol and plan of investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Intervention Testing - Participants will attend an experimental trial commencing between&#xD;
      6am and 10am, lasting ̴ 3.15h. Participants will be fasted overnight and instructed to&#xD;
      abstain from caffeine, alcohol and moderate/ vigorous exercise the day before testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this meeting participants will have the opportunity to ask any questions about the&#xD;
      study. Participants will then be asked to give written consent (participants may wish to take&#xD;
      longer to decide and this testing session will be rearranged if necessary). If consent is&#xD;
      given participants will complete a number of health measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, following 20 minutes supine rest central artery stiffness will be measured using a&#xD;
      Sphygmocor system. A blood pressure recording will be taken at the brachial artery and an ECG&#xD;
      waveform obtained. A tonometer will then be applied with gentle pressure at the femoral and&#xD;
      carotid arteries (thigh/neck) to measure aortic pulse wave velocity (a measure of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin sensitivity will be measured through an OGTT. A cannula will be placed into a forearm&#xD;
      vein of one arm and will be used to obtain repeated blood samples. A resting blood sample&#xD;
      (25ml) will be taken immediately before consumption of a 25% glucose beverage (75g of&#xD;
      glucose). Following this further blood samples (5ml) will be collected 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and&#xD;
      120 minutes after glucose ingestion. During the OGTT participants will complete a number of&#xD;
      other measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, participants will complete a questionnaire pack to assess psychological well-being&#xD;
      and self- report physical activity. The pack will include the International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire (IPAQ), General positive and negative affect (PANAS), Subjective Vitality Scale&#xD;
      (SVS), Health Perception (item from Medical Outcomes survey: MOS SF-36), Satisfaction with&#xD;
      Life Scale (SWLS), Behavioural Regulations to Exercise (BREQ-3), Adapted Perceived Competence&#xD;
      (PCS). Anthropometric measures will be taken (height, weight, waist-to-hip ratio). Body&#xD;
      composition will then be measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, once the OGTT is completed an incremental maximal aerobic capacity test (VO2max) to&#xD;
      volitional exhaustion will be conducted on a cycle ergometer. Throughout the test, measures&#xD;
      of oxygen uptake, blood pressure and heart rate will be taken. This test will allow us to&#xD;
      determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and maximal power output (Wmax). Following the test&#xD;
      heart rate recovery kinetics will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention Testing 3-7 days after their last training session participants will attend&#xD;
      the laboratory for a post-intervention testing session. This session will be identical in all&#xD;
      respects to the pre-intervention testing session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Version 1 15/12/16&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-Month Follow-up - 3-months after post-intervention testing participants will attend a final&#xD;
      testing session identical in all respects to the pre-intervention testing session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-based HIT - Participants will be provided with a training guide containing information&#xD;
      on the exercises and a suggested programme. The programme will also be explained during the&#xD;
      Pre-Intervention Testing session. Participants will be instructed to complete each training&#xD;
      session in a place of their choosing. The programme involves repeated 1 minute bouts of&#xD;
      simple on the spot movements interspersed with 1 minute of rest. During the intervals&#xD;
      participants will be advised to reach a heart rate of approx. 90% of their predicted maximum&#xD;
      heart rate (220-age). The 1 minute interval will be split between 2 consecutive 30 second&#xD;
      exercises. The research team have a library of 18 exercises, with 9 suggested exercise pairs.&#xD;
      The participant will be advised to complete 4 intervals during weeks 1 and 2, with the number&#xD;
      of intervals increasing by 1 every 2 weeks (maximum of 9 intervals). The participant will be&#xD;
      advised to train 3x per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Sefton Exercise Referral Scheme - The AS_ERS is a traditional exercise referral&#xD;
      programme providing highly discounted access to council operated leisure centres and a number&#xD;
      of partner gyms. Within this access patients will have access to gym and swimming facilities&#xD;
      (£2 per visit) and exercises classes (£3 per visit). During the patients first meeting with&#xD;
      their LDO a progressive personalised exercise programme will be developed. Following this the&#xD;
      patient will attend their local gym or leisure centre for an induction with a staff member(£7&#xD;
      one off fee), enabling them to attend the centre at any time and complete the designed&#xD;
      exercise programme. All exercise programmes will be different, but in general will include&#xD;
      moderate intensity exercise on gym equipment (treadmill, ergometer etc.) and some basic&#xD;
      resistance training. Patients may replace these gym sessions with exercises classes run by&#xD;
      the facility. Patients will be encouraged to exercise 3-5 time per week. Participants will be&#xD;
      given a training diary by the study team where they will be encouraged to write details of&#xD;
      the training sessions completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-Month Follow-up- Following the 12 week study intervention participants will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to complete the alternative intervention (HB_HIT or AS_ERS). Participants wanting&#xD;
      to complete the HB_HIT programme will be given a training guide and have the intervention&#xD;
      explained to them by the research team. Participants wanting to complete the AS_ERS will be&#xD;
      given discounted access to their local leisure centre for 12 weeks (see above) and a gym&#xD;
      induction will be arranged for them by their LRO. Neither group will have contact with the&#xD;
      Active Sefton Team, including LDO, during this 3-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Rate Monitoring - All Participants (HB_HIT and AS_ERS) will be given a polar H7&#xD;
      Bluetooth heart rate monitor. Participants will be advised to wear this monitor during all&#xD;
      training sessions. The monitor will provide a measure of training intensity for the AS_ERS&#xD;
      group, and compliance with the suggested heart rate target in the HB_HIT group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to download Polar Beat to their smartphone (a free Android and IOS&#xD;
      app). This app will be used to monitor heart rate during the training sessions. In addition,&#xD;
      participants will be given a login email address and password for Polar Flow&#xD;
      (www.polar.flow.com), a cloud storage site run by Polar for the storage and analysis of heart&#xD;
      rate data. All heart rate data measured during training sessions will be uploaded to Polar&#xD;
      Flow. This will allow the research team to investigate training intensity achieved during all&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Sefton Support - Throughout the study all participants (AS_ERS and HB_HIT) will&#xD;
      receive the normal support provided by the Active Sefton Scheme. This takes the form of 3&#xD;
      sessions with an LDO. These sessions will be pre, mid (6 weeks) and following the exercise&#xD;
      interventions. The LDO will be informed of the exercise programme conducted by the&#xD;
      participant, enabling them to provide program specific support to patients.&#xD;
