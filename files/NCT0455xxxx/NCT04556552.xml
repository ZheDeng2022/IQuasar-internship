      Subjects in this study will be patients with opioid use disorders (OUDs) based on DSM-5&#xD;
      criteria recruited from the greater Atlanta metropolitan region. Recruitment will be from&#xD;
      treatment programs in the greater Atlanta Metropolitan Region including the DeKalb Community&#xD;
      Service Board residential, detoxification and other treatment programs which with over 30,000&#xD;
      patient visits per year represents the largest treatment program in one of two urban counties&#xD;
      in greater Atlanta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial involves a second phase after completing an exploratory study in 20 patients with&#xD;
      OUDs to assess different timing parameters of nVNS effects on sympathetic measures and&#xD;
      symptoms of craving, as well as modelling to verify and iteratively refine the methods for&#xD;
      vagal nerve stimulation. The investigators in this trial will then apply nVNS comparing&#xD;
      active (N=10) to sham (N=10) in OUD patients recently started on medication, looking at&#xD;
      opioid craving, brain functional response with HR-PET, and cardiovascular and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarker responses to imagery-induced opioid drug craving.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this study will be patients with opioid use disorders (OUDs) based on DSM-5&#xD;
      criteria recruited from the greater Atlanta metropolitan region. The metropolitan Atlanta&#xD;
      area has about 2,623,744 persons age 12 or older. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental&#xD;
      Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 109,777 (4.18%) have non-medical use of prescription&#xD;
      pain relievers, and 48,302 are estimated to have an opioid use disorder. This DSMP describes&#xD;
      the UG3 phase which will study patients with OUDs early in the course of treatment. The Go-No&#xD;
      Go criteria listed below have to be met to proceed to the UH3. Recruitment will be from&#xD;
      treatment programs in the greater Atlanta Metropolitan Region including the DeKalb Community&#xD;
      Service Board residential, detoxification and other treatment programs which with over 30,000&#xD;
      patient visits per year represents the largest treatment program in one of two urban counties&#xD;
      in greater Atlanta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first UG3 phase will involve an exploratory study in 20 patients with OUDs to assess&#xD;
      different timing parameters of nVNS effects on sympathetic measures and symptoms of craving,&#xD;
      as well as modelling to verify and iteratively refine our methods for vagal nerve&#xD;
      stimulation. The investigators in this trial will then apply nVNS in a pilot study comparing&#xD;
      active (N=10) to sham (N=10) in OUD patients recently started on medication, looking at&#xD;
      opioid craving, brain functional response with HR-PET, and cardiovascular and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarker responses to imagery-induced opioid drug craving. Brain function will be measured&#xD;
      with high resolution positron emission tomography (HR-PET), autonomic function with wearable&#xD;
      sensing devices, and biomarkers will be measured in blood, with an assessment of a broad&#xD;
      range of stress responsive sympathetic, hormonal and immune markers.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in opioid craving using Visual Analogue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 minutes post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid craving will be measured based on Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) VAS consist in 10-point lines anchored with &quot;not at all&quot; on one end and &quot;extremely&quot; on the other where participants report the extent to which they felt any craving for opiates, severity of withdrawal symptoms, and the extent to which the study intervention has helped to ease the cravings. Total possible score ranges from 0 to100, with 100 correlating with worse study outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Heart rate (HR)</measure>

    <measure>Change in Pre-ejection Period (PEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 minutes post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-ejection Period (PEP) is a marker of cardiac sympathetic tone that is increased with blocked sympathetic function. Higher PEP correlates with better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 minutes post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Photoplethysmography (PPG) amplitude reflects vasoconstriction in figure blood vessel. PPG amplitude is increased with blocked sympathetic tone and higher PPG correlates with better outcome.</description>

    <intervention_name>Non invasive VN stimulation (nVNS)</intervention_name>
    <description>Stimulation of vagus nerve with active device. Participants will be administered nVNS using the electroCore GammaCore-S non-invasive VNS device. The intensity of the stimulus will be adjusted by the user, to the maximum tolerable level to ensure nVNS without causing excessive pain, the burst frequency to 5 kHz, and the envelope frequency to 25 Hz.&#xD;
The duration of delivery will be 2 minutes, and the beginning will coincide with initiation of acquisition of the HR-PET scan which will be 90 seconds in duration; following an additional 8 minutes, a second VNS delivery will be administered, in conjunction with which another scan will be obtained.</description>
