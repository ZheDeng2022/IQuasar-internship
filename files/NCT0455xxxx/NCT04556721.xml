  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective study is to assess the trend of sugammadex (and its&#xD;
      complex with rocuronium) concentration in surgical patients with routine outpatient&#xD;
      hemodialysis. Patients with end stage renal disease who are to receive general anesthesia and&#xD;
      muscle paralysis will have their paralysis by rocuronium reversed with sugammadex. Patients&#xD;
      will then have blood drawn during their next three routine hemodialysis sessions to assess&#xD;
      for the plasma concentration of sugammadex or the sugammadex-rocuronium complex over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage renal disease often have several additional comorbidities and stand&#xD;
      to benefit immensely from this established superior drug. Prior studies have not been able to&#xD;
      correlate negative adverse events with sugammadex in patients with end-stage renal disease.&#xD;
      More work needs to be done, however, to assess the fate of this renally excreted molecule. It&#xD;
      has been shown that there is potential to clear sugammadex with high flux dialysis. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that post-surgical patients with end-stage renal disease will see a significant&#xD;
      decrease in plasma sugammadex concentration after routine outpatient dialysis.&#xD;

    <description>After surgery and general anesthesia, a clinically-appropriate dose of Sugammadex will be utilized to reverse the rocuronium neuromuscular blockade. Either 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg dosing will be used based on the level of neuromuscular blockade at the time of reversal. Administer as single IV bolus injection infused over 10 seconds into existing IV line. Dose is based on actual body weight (mg/kg).</description>
