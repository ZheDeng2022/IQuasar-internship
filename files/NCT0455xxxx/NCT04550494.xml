  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies if talazoparib works in patients with cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body (advanced) and has mutation(s) in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage&#xD;
      response genes who have or have not already been treated with another PARP inhibitor.&#xD;
      Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP, a protein that helps repair damaged DNA. Blocking PARP&#xD;
      may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. All patients who take part on this study must have&#xD;
      a gene aberration that changes how their tumors are able to repair DNA. This trial may help&#xD;
      scientists learn whether some patients might benefit from taking different PARP inhibitors&#xD;
      &quot;one after the other&quot; and learn how talazoparib works in treating patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer who have aberration in DNA repair genes.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of talazoparib in tumor biopsies for patients&#xD;
      with aberrations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response genes who have or have not&#xD;
      received prior PARP inhibitor treatment (separately).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) of treatment&#xD;
      with talazoparib in patients with aberrations in DNA damage response genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Investigate tumor genomic alterations potentially associated with sensitivity or acquired&#xD;
      resistance to talazoparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo biopsy&#xD;
      at baseline and 4 hours after talazoparib dose on day 1 of cycle 2, and an optional biopsy&#xD;
      either at the restaging follow up or at the time of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
