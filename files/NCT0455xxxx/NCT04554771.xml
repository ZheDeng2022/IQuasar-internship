      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that stroma-targeting by tocilizumab in&#xD;
      patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction with highly&#xD;
      activated stroma increases efficacy of chemoradiotherapy measured by pathological response&#xD;
      according to the Mandard criteria. Patients will be grouped for ADAM12, a non-invasive&#xD;
      blood-borne marker of stromal activation.&#xD;

      Randomized phase II proof-of-concept study with tocilizumab and standard of care paclitaxel,&#xD;
      carboplatin and radiation followed by surgical resection of the oesophagus for patients with&#xD;
      surgically resectable adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus or oesophageal junction. Patients&#xD;
      will be grouped for serum ADAM12 with a cutoff of 203 ng/mL. Patients in both groups will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive tocilizumab 8mg/kg on day 1, 15 and 29 or not in addition to paclitaxel&#xD;
      50mg/m2, carboplatin dosed with area under the curve (AUC) 2 on day 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 and&#xD;
      radiation 41.4 Gy in 23 fractions. Surgery will be planned approximately in week 13-15, which&#xD;
      is 8 to 10 weeks after the end of chemoradiation.&#xD;
