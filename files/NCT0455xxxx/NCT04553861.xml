      This study aims to investigate the accuracy and precision of the Samsung Smartwatch with&#xD;
      conventional ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood pressure (BP) monitoring outside of the medical care environment is an increasingly&#xD;
      important part of clinical hypertension assessment and management. Ambulatory BP monitoring&#xD;
      (ABPM) uses automatic detection and recording devices for repeated determinations during an&#xD;
      extended period, typically 24 hours. This technique has been shown to substantially enhance&#xD;
      the clinician's understanding of BP behavior in patients and aid in diagnosis and therapeutic&#xD;
      decision making. The ABPM is superior to office BP in predicting target organ, hypertensive&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease, retinopathy, renal abnormalities, and alterations in vascular&#xD;
      compliance.1-4) Most of these studies have also demonstrated that a loss of nocturnal decline&#xD;
      in BP (so-called non-dipper) conveys excessive risk for stroke and myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although conventional ABMP is usually well tolerated by patients, a few problems do exist. A&#xD;
      minority of patients do not sleep well with the recorders and tend to have somewhat higher BP&#xD;
      values. Cuffs can also rotate, and different arm positions can change BP significantly.&#xD;
      Rarely, patients may develop erythema, ecchymoses, petechiae, or superficial phlebitis in the&#xD;
      area distal to cuff placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, smartwatches that measure BP without a cuff have become available. Since these&#xD;
      measurements are relatively more user-friendly than conventional cuff-based measurements,&#xD;
      they may aid in more frequent BP monitoring. Currently, only one study compared a&#xD;
      non-commercial armband wearable pulse transit time (PTT) system for 24-hour cuff-less BP&#xD;
      measurement with ABPM.5) We will investigate the accuracy and precision of Samsung Smartwatch&#xD;
      with ABPM in young, healthy volunteers.&#xD;
