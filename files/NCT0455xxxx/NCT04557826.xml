      This first-in-man (FIM) phase I study will evaluate the acute safety, tolerability,and&#xD;
      acceptability of the investigational RD19 device among 25 healthy volunteers between the age&#xD;
      of 18 and 45. Based on the results of numerous preclinical studies, a short 3 minute use&#xD;
      twice a day, separated by at least 4 hours, preferably 8 to 12 hours apart) will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability (local reactogenicity) will be assessed actively at the following&#xD;
      study days: screening (baseline set), 1, 7 and 14, and on non-clinic visit days by collection&#xD;
      of these data by history during clinic visits via a memory aid (diary cards). Volunteers will&#xD;
      be encouraged to promptly contact designated clinical trial staff or the one of the Sponsor's&#xD;
      Emergency Response Team for AEs of a medically urgent nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, as well as CBC with differential, urinalysis, and pregnancy&#xD;
      testing will be performed at screening and at Day 14 or early termination (and potentially&#xD;
      during unscheduled) clinic visits. Hematological safety assessments (evaluation of&#xD;
      methemoglobinemia) will be performed at all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study volunteers will be asked to immediately contact the clinical coordinator and/or the PI&#xD;
      in all instances where they experience an AE of greater than moderate intensity. Volunteers&#xD;
      will be instructed to report to the clinical trial unit for an unscheduled visit or to seek&#xD;
      the appropriate level of medical care based on the nature of their AE/SAE. In all such&#xD;
      instances, all relevant information pertaining to these significant medical events will be&#xD;
      captured on the appropriate e-CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematology safety laboratory evaluations will be performed at screening, as well during all&#xD;
      scheduled clinic visits. Laboratory assessments may be part of the evaluation of medically&#xD;
      attended AE evaluation and for all SAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon ratification of the CTA, the site began pre-recruitment outreach efforts of potential&#xD;
      volunteers within M3-WRA's database to ascertain &quot;interest in general&quot; in this study.&#xD;
      Official recruitment which may include fliers, letters, telephone calls, etc. and specific&#xD;
      recruitment of potential subjects who have previously participated in other clinical studies&#xD;
      conducted at the site commenced only after formal IRB approval. Other forms and/or mechanisms&#xD;
      of recruitment may also be used. The IRB will approved the recruitment process and all&#xD;
      materials prior to use.&#xD;
