  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of cryptic microbes has been widely documented in animal healthy deep tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thyroid gland is an organ specifically exposed to the microbial environment due to its&#xD;
      close location to the mouth microbiome. A number of bacterial phenotypes has been detected in&#xD;
      the inflamed thyroid gland. A question raises as to whether bacteria have not already been&#xD;
      present in the thyroid gland before the clinical symptoms of goiter became evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A problem in thyroid surgery, relatively uncommon but difficult for control, is prolonged&#xD;
      thyroidectomy wound healing with skin flap, gland bed inflammation and fibrosis. The&#xD;
      causative bacteria may belong to the strains persistently present in the thyroid gland&#xD;
      parenchyma. Our objective is to answer questions: a) do the goiter tissue structures contain&#xD;
      bacteria, b) if so, which bacterial phenotypes can be identified, c) what are the genetic&#xD;
      similarities of the thyroid and periodontal bacterial strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies are carried out in patients with non-toxic multinodular goiter, toxic multinodular&#xD;
      goiter, Graves' disease, single adenoma, Hashimoto's disease, thyroid cancer and recurrent&#xD;
      thyroid disease. Tissue harvested during surgery is dissected immediately after thyroidectomy&#xD;
      into fragments of parenchyma, arteries, veins and lymph nodes and cultured on Columbia blood&#xD;
      agar base for up to 3 weeks. In this method bacteria present in the tissue grow in their&#xD;
      natural environment, slowly proliferate and then form the on-plate colonies. It enables&#xD;
      detection of even single bacteria usually difficult to be identified in planktonic media.&#xD;
      Identification of the isolated bacteria is performed. Their DNA patterns are also compared.&#xD;
