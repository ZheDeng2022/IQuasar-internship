  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchial remodeling is an abnormal tissue repair process of the bronchial wall components&#xD;
      that characterizes severe asthma which can include epithelial abrasion, thickening of the&#xD;
      reticular basement membrane (RBM), an increase in bronchial fibrosis, blood vessel count,&#xD;
      mucosal gland mass and/or bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) mass. We identified using latent&#xD;
      class analysis two classes of patients. Compared to the second class, the first class was&#xD;
      characterized by an increase in RBM thickness, blood vessel count, BSM mass and a decrease in&#xD;
      RBM-BSM distance, mucus gland mass and bronchial fibrosis. We then hypothesized that this&#xD;
      first latent class identified children at risk of asthma exacerbations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most frequent chronic disease in children. Severe asthma is characterized by&#xD;
      airway hyperresponsiveness, bronchial inflammation and bronchial remodeling 1. Bronchial&#xD;
      remodeling is an abnormal tissue repair process of the bronchial wall components which can&#xD;
      include epithelial abrasion, thickening of the reticular basement membrane (RBM), an increase&#xD;
      in bronchial fibrosis, blood vessel count, mucosal gland mass and/or bronchial smooth muscle&#xD;
      (BSM) mass. At preschool age (before 6 years old), asthmatic children constitute a&#xD;
      heterogeneous population and several classifications have been proposed to identify distinct&#xD;
      phenotypes according to the chronology of asthma 2, the triggers of asthma 3, the trajectory&#xD;
      of lung function as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 4 or according to&#xD;
      a combination of clinical and inflammatory variables 5. More recently, we demonstrated for&#xD;
      the first time using latent class analysis (LCA) that subgroups of severe asthmatic children&#xD;
      could also be identified according to bronchial remodeling parameters (unpublished data).&#xD;
      Indeed, we identified two latent classes of patients. Compared to the second class, the first&#xD;
      latent class was characterized by an increase in RBM thickness, blood vessel count, BSM mass&#xD;
      and a decrease in RBM-BSM distance, seromucosal gland mass and bronchial fibrosis&#xD;
      (unpublished data). Since, previous studies showed that bronchial remodeling could have&#xD;
      negative impact on the patients' outcomes, we therefore hypothesized that the latent classes&#xD;
      identified from the bronchial remodeling data in severe preschool asthmatic children included&#xD;
      in the &quot;P'tit Asthme&quot; study (NCT02806466) could identify children at risk of asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids therapy.&#xD;
