  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate components of a preschool-based intervention designed&#xD;
      to (1) increase children's nutrition knowledge, (2) increase physical activity in childcare&#xD;
      settings, (3) increase emotional, behavioral and eating-related regulation, and (4) provide&#xD;
      guidance to parents/caregivers about appropriate parenting and child-feeding strategies that&#xD;
      promote healthy eating behaviors, dietary patterns and physical activity in preschool-aged&#xD;
      children. The long-term goal is to help children develop healthy habits that reduce risk for&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Findings from intervention studies designed to prevent obesity among preschool children are&#xD;
      mixed. One approach to stemming the development of obesity in childhood is to alter&#xD;
      children's choices and environments in ways that promote food literacy, acceptance of healthy&#xD;
      foods, physical activity and self-regulation. Research on factors that influence the&#xD;
      development of obesity in children has identified factors in children's environments that are&#xD;
      potential targets for prevention programs. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of components designed for a preschool-based approach to preventing obesity in children.&#xD;
      Using an innovative approach to optimizing behavioral interventions, the multiphase&#xD;
      optimization strategy (MOST), we will examine the effects of a 28-week, randomized set of&#xD;
      experiments designed to (1) increase children's nutrition knowledge, (2) increase physical&#xD;
      activity in childcare settings, (3) increase emotional, behavioral and eating-related&#xD;
      regulation, and (4) provide guidance to parents/caregivers about appropriate parenting and&#xD;
      child-feeding strategies that promote healthy eating behaviors, dietary patterns and physical&#xD;
      activity in preschool-aged children. Participants will include over 1300 predominantly&#xD;
      low-income preschool children ages 3 to 5 years attending center-based childcare settings in&#xD;
      Pennsylvania (~100 classrooms). The proposed study will provide information on the most&#xD;
      efficacious components that produce measurable changes in children's nutrition knowledge and&#xD;
      obesity-related behaviors. The results of this study will be used to inform the design of a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to prevent obesity in children.&#xD;
