      The patients will randomly be divided into two equal groups in number:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group A :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thirty patients will participate in physical therapy program in form of high-tone&#xD;
           external muscle stimulation (HTEMS), with Frequencies continuously will be scanned from&#xD;
           4096 Hz to 31768 Hz, allowing for a much higher power of up to 5000 mW to be introduced&#xD;
           3 times per week, for 10 weeks plus supervised regular aerobic exercise program on&#xD;
           stationary bicycle with moderate intensity, ( score 12-14 on Borg scale for rate of&#xD;
           perceived exertion) 40 minutes per session, 3 times per week, for 10 weeks .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty patients will participate in a supervised regular aerobic exercise program only on&#xD;
      stationary bicycle with moderate intensity, (score 12-14 on Borg scale for rate of perceived&#xD;
      exertion) 40 minutes per session, 3 times per week, for 10 weeks.&#xD;
