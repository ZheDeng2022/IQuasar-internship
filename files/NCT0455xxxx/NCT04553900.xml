  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent data suggests that increased temperature improves inotropic function during systole&#xD;
      and may improve diastolic function in healthy humans at rest, despite a reduction in left&#xD;
      ventricular volume at end diastole. The effect of heat stress has not been reported in&#xD;
      patients receiving general anesthesia and the impact of general anesthesia on these findings&#xD;
      is not known. Trans-esophageal echocardiography will be used to measure parameters important&#xD;
      to both systolic and diastolic function at temperature intervals of 1Â°C in patients&#xD;
      undergoing &quot;Heated Intraoperative Peritoneal Chemotherapy&quot; (HIPEC.) That general anesthesia&#xD;
      will not alter the cardiovascular effects of increased temperature that has been reported in&#xD;
      healthy, un-anesthetized humans is the hypothesis.&#xD;
