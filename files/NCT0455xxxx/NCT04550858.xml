  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori infection is the main cause of peptic ulcer (1, 2) Some consensus&#xD;
      conferences have recommended triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two types&#xD;
      of antibiotics for 7 days as first-line treatment when patients with peptic ulcer have&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori infection.(3, 4)This recommendation is based on the finding that patients&#xD;
      with proven eradication of H. pylori have an extremely low rate of recurrence of peptic&#xD;
      ulcer.(5) Although a well-controlled study found comparable rates of small gastric ulcer&#xD;
      healing after eradication therapy alone without continuation of antiulcer treatment, relief&#xD;
      of symptoms was significantly slower with eradication therapy alone. Moreover, the success&#xD;
      rate of eradication therapy has decreased during the past few decades, and whether or not&#xD;
      eradication is successful becomes clear only 2-4 weeks after treatment(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with large gastric ulcer lesions are often not completely healed with H. pylori&#xD;
      eradication alone (7) . Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have become the mainstay of maintenance&#xD;
      therapy after eradication of H. pylori infection due to the associated effective healing and&#xD;
      fast relief of symptoms without tachyphylaxis. However, PPI therapy has some risks, including&#xD;
      dyspeptic symptom or rebound acid hypersecretion after cessation that may induce dependence&#xD;
      (8,9) , drug interactions with other substrate of CYP2C19, and some kinds of respiratory or&#xD;
      gastrointestinal infections . Also, the result of H. pylori eradication can be affected by&#xD;
      such antisecretory drugs.(10) Rebamipide is a gastroprotective antiulcer drug that has been&#xD;
      found to reduce the rate of recurrence of gastric ulcers without affecting H. pylori status,&#xD;
      unlike antisecretory drugs such as PPIs and H2 receptor antagonists.6 and have a healing rate&#xD;
      of about 90% at 8 weeks after eradication therapy (11) Rebamipide (2-(4-&#xD;
      chlorobenzoylamino)-3-[2-(1H)-quinolinon-4-yl] propionic acid) prevents gastric ulcer&#xD;
      formation by inhibiting neutrophil activation. Rebamipide stimulates prostaglandin generation&#xD;
      in the gastric mucosa, resulting in stimulation of mucus secretion. Rebamipide inhibits H.&#xD;
      pylori adhesion to the gastric epithelial cells.(12) The primary aim of study to evaluate&#xD;
      whether rebamipide could improve success rates of anti-H. pylori treatment .&#xD;
