      A study to assess the effect of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, and the effect of&#xD;
      rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, on the pharmacokinetics of fruquintinib in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, open-label, 2-part, 2-period fixed sequence crossover&#xD;
      study to be conducted with 28 healthy male and female subjects. The study will consist of a&#xD;
      Screening Phase (Screening and Day -1), a Treatment Phase (Period 1 and Period 2), and an End&#xD;
      of Study (EOS) Phase. Screening will occur within 21 days before the first study drug&#xD;
      administration. There will be at least a 14-day washout of fruquintinib between treatment&#xD;
      periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: subjects will be administered fruquintinib alone in treatment Period 1 and in&#xD;
      combination with itraconazole in treatment Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: subjects will be administered fruquintinib alone in treatment Period 1 and in&#xD;
      combination with rifampin in treatment Period 2.&#xD;
