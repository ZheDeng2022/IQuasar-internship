      This study will examine the effects of brain stimulation on pain symptoms associated with&#xD;
      Major depressive disorder. This study will enroll 69 Subjects. Study subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to complete surveys about their mood and well-being, 2 blood draws, 2 MRIs, 3&#xD;
      electroencephalograms, and receive 30 treatments of blinded transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation. There is no control group as all subjects will receive some form of active&#xD;
      treatment. Subjects are required to participate in 30-33 study visits and volunteer 40 hours&#xD;
      of their time. Compensation for this study is $150 for completing all study activities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of multi-site&#xD;
      repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on chronic pain and inflammatory&#xD;
      responses in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is the leading cause of disability&#xD;
      worldwide. One reason for the extraordinarily high burden of depression is painful somatic&#xD;
      symptoms: more than half of MDD patients complain of moderate to severe pain that is&#xD;
      associated with interference in function and unemployment and which can lead to opioid use&#xD;
      disorder. The neuro-immune interaction is increasingly understood as the underlying mechanism&#xD;
      of this comorbidity. Sustained psychosocial stress can cause a lasting increase in systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, which may be a key mediator of chronic pain and depression. Pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines have been linked to the dysregulation of signaling in the mesocorticolimbic system&#xD;
      and affect-related circuits present in both chronic pain and depression. Meta-analyses have&#xD;
      identified higher CRP, IL6, and TNFa among depressed patients. Additionally, CRP was found to&#xD;
      be increasingly higher with higher number failed treatment trials, suggesting that treatment&#xD;
      resistant depression (TRD) patients who qualify for rTMS tend to have higher inflammation&#xD;
      than those who respond to pharmacological antidepressant treatment [6]. Further, baseline&#xD;
      levels of transcriptional control pathways (TCP) related to immune or sympathetic activation&#xD;
      and glucocorticoid insensitivity mediate experimentally induced depressed mood. Even though&#xD;
      the inflammatory reaction may originate in the periphery, downstream effects can result in&#xD;
      neuroinflammation and changes in neural network function through several immune-to-brain&#xD;
      signaling pathways. Previous research has shown that functional connectivity between DLPFC&#xD;
      and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) also mediates neuroinflammation levels in ACC, and which&#xD;
      was linked to depressive scores in chronic pain patients [8]. rTMS to the left dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that has proven&#xD;
      clinical efficacy for MDD and rTMS to primary motor cortex (M1) has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      reduce chronic pain, including fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, headache and regional pain].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these findings, the investigators hypothesize that combined rTMS to depression and&#xD;
      pain targets will reduce both depressive and pain symptoms and will also result in an&#xD;
      effective reduction of systemic inflammation. The proposed research will examine the effects&#xD;
      of 30 neuro-navigated sessions of active vs. sham rTMS using four conditions: A) active rTMS&#xD;
      at DLPFC and sham at M1; B) active rTMS at M1 and sham at DLPFC; C) active rTMS at DLPFC and&#xD;
      M1; D) sham rTMS at DLPFC and M1. This design will help to dissociate the impact of an&#xD;
      antidepressant response on pain reduction (condition A), the analgesic effect on depressive&#xD;
      symptoms (condition B), or whether the combined treatment (condition C) will result in a&#xD;
      synergetic effect. The investigators will focus on pain types related to inflammation&#xD;
      including fibromyalgia (FM) and ME/CFS, whose symptomatic profiles are closely overlapping&#xD;
      with those of MDD and may thus preferentially respond to rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will combine the analysis of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines with&#xD;
      transcriptomic analyses, which may be even more sensitive to short-term changes. Functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) data will be used to&#xD;
      assess biomarkers and mechanisms of action (MOA) of successful rTMS treatment for pain. The&#xD;
      conceptualization of pain treatment in MDD at the brain network and systemic levels makes&#xD;
      this study a highly innovative approach to neuropsychiatric research.&#xD;
