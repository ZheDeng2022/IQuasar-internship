  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate&#xD;
      implant-based breast reconstruction and compare the outcomes of patients who are discharged&#xD;
      the day of surgery versus patients who are discharged on post-operative day one. The primary&#xD;
      aim of the study will be to compare the postoperative outcomes and complications between the&#xD;
      two study groups within 30 days of discharge. The secondary aims of the study will be to&#xD;
      compare patient satisfaction, quality of life and discharge perceptions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate implant-based breast&#xD;
      reconstruction were admitted to the hospital overnight. However, recent retrospective studies&#xD;
      utilizing ERAS protocols have reported same day discharge as a possibility for this patient&#xD;
      population. ERAS protocols for breast cancer surgery and reconstruction are becoming more&#xD;
      popular. This along with the increasing utilization of prepectoral breast reconstruction that&#xD;
      is associated with less postoperative pain and opioid use, are promising avenues to decrease&#xD;
      the need for overnight hospital stay. If it can be shown that discharge on the same day of&#xD;
      surgery does not pose any major risks compared to discharge on post-operative day one, there&#xD;
      is the potential to decrease length of hospital stay, improve hospital capacity and&#xD;
      dramatically decrease costs.&#xD;
