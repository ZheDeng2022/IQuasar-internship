      The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between bupropion, stimulant use and&#xD;
      relapse, ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), and measures of mood, drug craving,&#xD;
      and inhibitory control in individuals enrolled in inpatient treatment for stimulant-use&#xD;
      disorder with and without ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimenters hypothesize that Bupropion and Contrave (Bupropion/Naltrexone) will&#xD;
      increase inhibitory control and decrease drug craving and depressive symptoms in recently&#xD;
      abstinent stimulant users in inpatient treatment with effects greater than those seen in&#xD;
      recently abstinent stimulant users completing inpatient treatment as usual. An additional&#xD;
      hypothesis is that relapse rates after leaving inpatient treatment in the group receiving&#xD;
      bupropion will be lower than those of the group completing inpatient treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design consists of four assessments of drug craving, inhibitory control, impulsive&#xD;
      choice, and mood (depression and anxiety). The timepoints for these assessments include: A.&#xD;
      baseline after entering treatment B. 2 weeks after starting drug C. 8 weeks after starting&#xD;
      drug, and D. 1 month after leaving treatment. Following eligibility screening, 60 stimulant&#xD;
      users will be enrolled in one of 3 groups. Group 1 Bupropion Active Group: 20 subjects will&#xD;
      receive bupropion for 8 weeks during inpatient treatment. Group 2 Contrave Active Group: 20&#xD;
      subjects will receive Contrave for 8 weeks during inpatient treatment. Group 3 Control Group:&#xD;
      20 subjects enrolled in inpatient treatment will complete treatment as usual as well as the&#xD;
      four assessments (A-D) described above but will not receive drug (convenience control). Half&#xD;
      of the subjects in each group will be diagnosed with ADHD and half will not, for a total of&#xD;
      10 subjects per group with ADHD.&#xD;

      1. Participants will be recruited from the Clare Foundation (CLARE|MATRIX), where they will&#xD;
           be residing in a residential substance use disorder program. Potential participants&#xD;
           recently admitted with stimulant use disorder will be given a flyer/research information&#xD;
           sheet describing the study when they are admitted to the study. Interested parties will&#xD;
           sign their name on the sheet to indicate their interest, and will meet with a UCLA&#xD;
           research associate at Clare to discuss details of the protocol and undergo initial&#xD;
           screening following verbal consent. Initial screening involves a one page screening&#xD;
           sheet and discussing the information sheet with the research associate at Clare.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If participants remain eligible following initial screening, they will enroll in the&#xD;
           study and the UCLA research associate will set up an in person screening to sign the&#xD;
           informed consent form and undergo additional screening. After completing informed&#xD;
           consent and going through the informed consent quiz, a Nurse Practitioner or physician&#xD;
           will take a medical history, take a personal and family health profile, perform a&#xD;
           physical examination (History &amp; Physical). Participants who provide written consent will&#xD;
           complete questionnaires about their mood, medical, psychiatric and drug use history,&#xD;
           personality and life experiences. The screening visit will also include a psychiatric&#xD;
           diagnostic interview (MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview M.I.N.I) completed&#xD;
           by a trained diagnostician. Participants will also give a urine sample to determine what&#xD;
           drugs they have recently used, a breath sample to determine the carbon monoxide levels&#xD;
           in their system. Participants will travel to UCLA to give a blood sample to assess&#xD;
           complete blood count, metabolic panel, screening for infectious diseases (Hepatitis B&#xD;
           and C, HIV, syphilis) and tests of kidney function and receive an ECG&#xD;
           (electrocardiogram). After all screening procedures have been completed, a study&#xD;
           physician will collect and review ECG and laboratory tests to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After completing all screening procedures, eligible participants will complete the&#xD;
           following baseline assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A) Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Prior to completing cognitive tasks behavioral testing, participants will will have&#xD;
           their blood drawn by a London laboratory phlebotomist or will visit the Clinical and&#xD;
           Translational Research Center (CTRC), where a registered nurse will draw approximately&#xD;
           40mL of blood. Blood samples will be assayed for genetic markers associated with smoking&#xD;
           and stimulant use. The purpose of the genetic analysis is to examine the relationship&#xD;
           between genetic polymorphisms, treatment outcomes, circulating study drug, and measures&#xD;
           of cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) samples acquired from this protocol will be added to a&#xD;
           larger database of DNA samples collected from participants in London Laboratory&#xD;
           protocols. DNA samples will be stored for future use other than the aims and goals of&#xD;
           this study. Participants will not receive their results because our laboratory is only&#xD;
           qualified for genetic analyses associated with research purposes and is not certified&#xD;
           for clinical assessment of genetic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This blood sample will also be used to determine follicular and luteal phase in female&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Urine toxicology: Participants will provide urine to assess recent use of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii. Cognitive/behavioral testing: Participants will complete some of the following&#xD;
           tasks to assess inhibitory control and decision-making: Working memory (N-back test),&#xD;
           declarative memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task), sustained attention (Rapid&#xD;
           Visual Information Processing), inhibitory control (Stop Signal Test) reward-based&#xD;
           decision-making (Monetary Delay Discounting and Reversal Learning, BART [Balloon&#xD;
           Analogue Risk Task], ART [Angling Risk Task]), and impulsive and risk taking behavior&#xD;
           (BIS [Barratt Impulsiveness Scale], Willingness-to-wait task, Domain-Specific&#xD;
           Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) Scale, UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, TCI [Temperament Character&#xD;
           Inventory]), Loss Aversion, the Risk and Ambiguity Task, craving (Brief Meth Craving&#xD;
           Questionnaire), mindfulness (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness&#xD;
           [MAIA], Mindful Attention Awareness Scale [MAAS], Body Perception Questionnaire Body&#xD;
           Awareness Very Short Form [BPQ]), and withdrawal from cigarettes (Shiffman-Jarvik&#xD;
           Withdrawal Scale) and amphetamines (Amphetamine Cessation Symptom Assessment [ASCA]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants in the active medication pool will be assigned to Contrave or Bupropion&#xD;
           treatment based on timing of entry into the study (the London laboratory will initially&#xD;
           assess Contrave effects). Participants assigned to the convenience control group will&#xD;
           complete treatment as usual and will not take medication. The medication conditions will&#xD;
           require that participants take capsules as instructed over the course of 8 weeks.&#xD;
           Medications for the upcoming week will be dispensed at the beginning of each week. At&#xD;
           the end of each week, the participants will meet with the study physician for a check-up&#xD;
           to monitor potential adverse events. After the 8-wk regimen, participants will undergo&#xD;
           repeat testing cognitive and behavioral tests as described in section 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Intervention and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants will receive inpatient treatment as usual, including cognitive&#xD;
           behavioral therapy. Within 10 days of entering treatment, participants in Group 1&#xD;
           (Bupropion Group) will begin receiving daily extended-release oral bupropion (Wellbutrin&#xD;
           XL) at a dose of 450 mg, which was well tolerated by individuals with methamphetamine&#xD;
           use disorder in a prior study. The dose will be titrated: 150 mg on Days 1 and 2, 300 mg&#xD;
           on Days 3 and 4, and 450 mg on Day 5. Dosing will continue for a total of 4 weeks during&#xD;
           inpatient treatment, and thereafter for another month, with compliance monitored by&#xD;
           smartphone. A reduction to 300 mg will permitted to alleviate medication-related adverse&#xD;
           effects if they occur. Participants in Group 2 (Contrave Group) will begin receiving&#xD;
           daily oral Contrave at a dose of 360 mg (Naltrexone HCl 32mg, Bupropion HCl 360mg),&#xD;
           which was well tolerated by individuals in a prior study The dose will be titrated: 8&#xD;
           mg/90 mg on Week 1, 16 mg/180 mg on Week 2, 24 mg/270 mg on Week 3 and 32 mg/360 mg on&#xD;
           Week 4. Dosing will continue for a total of 4 weeks during inpatient treatment, and&#xD;
           thereafter for another month, with compliance monitored by smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After completing medication treatment (active) or treatment as usual (control),&#xD;
           participants will complete the following assessments:&#xD;

           Translational Research Center (CTRC), where a registered nurse will draw approximately&#xD;
           40mL of blood. Blood samples will be assayed for genetic markers associated with smoking&#xD;
           and stimulant use. The purpose of the genetic analysis is to examine the relationship&#xD;
           between genetic polymorphisms, treatment outcomes, circulating study drug, and measures&#xD;
           of cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The DNA samples acquired from this protocol will be added to a larger database of DNA&#xD;
           samples collected from participants in London Laboratory protocols. DNA samples will be&#xD;
           stored for future use other than the aims and goals of this study. Participants will not&#xD;
           receive their results because our laboratory is only qualified for genetic analyses&#xD;
           associated with research purposes and is not certified for clinical assessment of&#xD;
           genetic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This blood sample will also be used to determine follicular and luteal phase in female&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
