  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety, tolerance and dose of BM7PE treating patients&#xD;
      with colorectal cancer who have progressed to standard cell therapy or cannot tolerate such&#xD;
      therapy. The study starts as a phase 1 study with the aim of assessing the final dose for&#xD;
      this group of patients. Based on the results, the study will continue into a phase 2. The&#xD;
      phase 2 study aim to examine overall survival ≥ 9.3 months.&#xD;

    <description>The BM7PE treatment will be administered as a 20-minute i.v. infusion. The treatment is repeated after 2 weeks (day 15). The patients will be treated as in-patients and will stay at the hospital until toxicity have decreased to grade 2 and or plasma AST and or ALT levels has started to decrease. For at least a minimum of 3 days.&#xD;
The dose administered to the patient will be 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 μg/kg body weight.</description>
