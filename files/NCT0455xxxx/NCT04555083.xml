  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      chronic ankle instability previously approved in many studies that it may lead to more&#xD;
      proximal adaptations and negative long term consequences. one of those studies reported,&#xD;
      ankle instability patients has hamstring muscle shortening in comparison with non sprained&#xD;
      subjects. another one concluded that gluteus maximums muscle has delayed activation and&#xD;
      weakness in CAI patients. Both muscles (hamstring and gluteus Maximus ) contribute to&#xD;
      sacroiliac joint stability. therefore, this study asked a novel research question, was&#xD;
      sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SIJD) associated with CAI?&#xD;

      The sample size of this study had been calculated based on the primary outcome that was the&#xD;
      association between CAI and SIJD after a pilot study done in order to detect odd's ratio. ,&#xD;
      calculation made by a program developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      with the following inputting data :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-sided confidence interval 95%, power 80%, ratio of controls to cases 1, percent of&#xD;
      control exposed 4.5% , odds ratio 32%. The sample size calculations required for this study&#xD;
      was 28 participants (14 in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data distributions was checked for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test and for equality of&#xD;
      variance using Box's test. Box and whiskers plots were used for detecting the outliers.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics calculated for demographic data. Intraclass correlation coefficients&#xD;
      (ICC) and standard errors of measurement (SEM) were calculated to estimate the intratester&#xD;
      reliability and precision of measurement for the static pelvic rotation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of these study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Association between CAI and SIJD represents through odd's ratio (primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pelvic torsion difference between CAI and control Calculated by Mann- Whitney test&#xD;
           (secondary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlations between pelvic torsion with perceived ankle instability and number of&#xD;
           giving way episodes calculated Pearson correlation coefficient(secondary outcome) Effect&#xD;
           size analysis was calculated to determine the clinical significant difference.&#xD;
           Statistical analysis was conducted using the statistical package for social studies&#xD;
           (SPSS) for windows, version 24 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The normative data presented&#xD;
           as Mean ± standard deviation (SD) while non-normative data presented as median.&#xD;
           Significance was set at p &lt; 0.05 and total study power was set 80%&#xD;
