      A multi-center sample collection study in patients presenting with pigmented lesion(s)&#xD;
      suspicious for melanoma. All suspicious lesions should meet at least one of the &quot;ABCDE&quot;&#xD;
      (asymmetry, border, color, diameter, evolving) criteria. Patients will be consented for the&#xD;
      study and screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once the patient is&#xD;
      determined to be acceptable for the study they will be assigned a unique patient number and&#xD;
      tissue collection will begin. Tissue from the lesion will be collected using DermTech's&#xD;
      non-invasive adhesive patch kit according to the instructions for use followed by surgical&#xD;
      biopsy. Digital dermoscopy of the lesion is preferred but not required.&#xD;

             one of the &quot;ABCDE&quot; criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The pigmented lesion mst be at least 3mm and not more than 16mm in diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is willing to follow the start of care to test and treat the pigmented lesion&#xD;
             as determined by the treating physician&#xD;

          7. Willing to provide informed consent to participate in this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Require a surgical biopsy or excision of the lesion of interest prior to the DermTech&#xD;
             non-invasive patch biopsy(ies)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has an ulcerated or bleeding lesion that could confound the biopsy results&#xD;
