  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. The diagnosis&#xD;
      of PD is primarily based on clinical presentations while the pathology stage of a-synuclein&#xD;
      containing Lewy body deposition has already advanced. In addition to PD, there is another&#xD;
      group of patients presenting with parkinsonism features mixed with other neurodegenerative&#xD;
      symptoms. Pathologically, patients with these PD-mimicking parkinsonism syndromes, such as&#xD;
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration disorders (CBGD) and&#xD;
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with/without parkinsonism, have 4 repeat paired helical&#xD;
      filament forms of tau protein (4R PHF-tau) aggregations in the neurons. Patients with these&#xD;
      tauopathy related parkinsonism-plus syndromes could initially present as PD symptoms but will&#xD;
      have a more deliberating disease course and combine with other systems degeneration. These&#xD;
      patients are often a substantial diagnostic challenge to clinicians. Therefore, there is an&#xD;
      urgent need to develop reliable imaging and biofluid biomarkers for differentiating patients&#xD;
      with PD and variable parkinsonism-plus syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, new generation of novel radiotracer 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607), which can be labeled&#xD;
      with 4R PHF-tau without significant off-target binding, has been successfully developed.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will enroll 150 participants, including 30 healthy controls, 30 PD&#xD;
      patients, and 60 patients with different parkinsonism-plus syndromes (including 10 patients&#xD;
      with multiple system atrophy, 10 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, 10 patients&#xD;
      with cortical basal syndrome and 30 patients with frontotemporal dementia), and 30 patients&#xD;
      with mild cognitive decline (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). All participants will receive&#xD;
      complete neurological examination, 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607) PET, brain MRI scans, plasma markers&#xD;
      for total/phosphorylated tau, a-synuclein and Ab42/Ab40 and genetic markers covering&#xD;
      MAPT、SNCA、LRRK2、GBA and APOE genes. We aim to explore:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607) can differentiate patients with tauopathy (PSP, CBGD, FTD,&#xD;
           MCI and AD) and synucleinopathy (PD, MSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether the distribution of tau deposition detected by 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607) correlate&#xD;
           to disease severity, progression, and prognosis in patients with tauopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Whether the loading of tau deposition detected by 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607) correlate to&#xD;
           plasma levels of total/phosphorylated tau.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine specific genetic susceptibility sub-groups are more vulnerable to tau&#xD;
           deposition detected by 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607) in patients with tauopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research results will help to understand the potential of 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607) as an&#xD;
      imaging biomarker for diagnosis, severity and therapeutic assessment tool for patients with&#xD;
      tauopathy.&#xD;
