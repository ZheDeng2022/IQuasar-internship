  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a rapidly growing epidemic that is associated with the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, some individuals with obesity appear to be resistant&#xD;
      to CVD, and other individuals demonstrate resilience to obesity and CVD risk factors. The&#xD;
      investigator's overall objective is to understand factors contributing to the heterogeneity&#xD;
      of CVD resistance and resilience among individuals with obesity at Duke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator aims to recruit participants with 4 phenotypes: 200 participants with&#xD;
      obesity (BMI ≥ 30) and high 10-year ASCVD risk (≥20%), 200 participants with obesity (BMI ≥&#xD;
      30) and low 10-year ASCVD risk (&lt;7.5%), 100 participants with normal weight (BMI 18-25) and&#xD;
      high 10-year ASCVD risk (≥20%), and 100 participants with normal weight (BMI 18-25) and low&#xD;
      10-year ASCVD risk (&lt;7.5%). Clinical, behavioral, and molecular characteristics will be&#xD;
      compared at baseline between the 4 groups to understand heterogeneity between obesity and&#xD;
      risk for CVD, and participants with obesity will undergo a 6-month weight loss intervention.&#xD;
      In individuals with obesity, clinical, behavioral, and molecular characteristics will be&#xD;
      compared between baseline and 6 months to understand (a) predictors of response to the&#xD;
      intervention and (b) how these factors change with weight loss. Differences in branched-chain&#xD;
      amino acids will be compared between all groups, both at baseline and at 6 months (for those&#xD;
      participants undergoing the digital-weight loss intervention). Other clinical, behavioral,&#xD;
      metabolomic, genetic, and microbiome parameters will also be compared in an exploratory&#xD;
      fashion. There may be possible risk of loss of confidentiality, but this risk is low and&#xD;
      measures will be taken to minimize this risk.&#xD;
