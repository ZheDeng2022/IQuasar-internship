  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this evidence-based practice project is to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      providing a relaxation mindfulness meditation and an expressive digital arts activity among&#xD;
      clinical staff at Dana Farber Cancer Institute .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project provides an opportunity for patient care staff in an ambulatory oncology setting&#xD;
      to participate in and evaluate an activity that includes a mindfulness meditation technique&#xD;
      and an expressive digital arts activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the feasibility of providing a mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation and digital imagery activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The activity will include a guided mindfulness meditation and the creation of a digital&#xD;
           image on an iPad.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to complete brief surveys before and after the intervention&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in participant state anxiety will be evaluated using the visual analogue scale in measuring state anxiety. The electronic scale displays a horizontal line divided into 30 equal-sized partitions. The left edge of the scale is marked &quot;calm&quot; and the right edge is marked &quot;anxious.&quot; A sliding locator is positioned at the midpoint of the scale. The participant is instructed to use the computer mouse to place the locator at the scale position representing their current level of anxiety. The score is automatically calculated by rounding the relative distance of the locator from the left edge of the scale to the nearest integer value between 0 and 30. A higher score indicates greater anxiety. A comparison of scores pre- and post- intervention by calculating a paired t-test comparison of means</description>
