  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate performance and safety of the VitalConnect&#xD;
      Platform when used for mobile cardiac telemetry (MCT) or as an independent diagnostic testing&#xD;
      facility (IDTF) system during activities of daily living by subjects 18 years or older who&#xD;
      have been recommended MCT by their care provider.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Each patient will be monitored for up-to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Monitor the heart rhythm of the study subjects initially for up to 24 hours and if the monitoring finds the issue that the doctor is looking for, the monitoring will be stopped. In most of the cases, the monitoring can continue for up to 30 days for each study subject</description>

    <description>The VitalConnect Platform is a wireless remote monitoring system intended for use by healthcare professionals for continuous collection of physiological and irregular heart rhythm data in home and healthcare settings. This includes heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate variability (R-R interval), breathing rate, arrhythmia detection, body temperature, skin temperature, activity (including step count), and posture (body position relative to gravity including fall). Data is transmitted wirelessly to a central location where it is stored for analysis. The VitalConnect Platform can be configured by authorized persons to notify healthcare professionals when physiological data falls outside selected parameters</description>
