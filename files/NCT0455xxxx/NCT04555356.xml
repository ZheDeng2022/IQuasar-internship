  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is frequently seen in the adolescent age group, with a prevalence approaching&#xD;
      that of the adult age group. The most common type is non-specific, self-limiting low back&#xD;
      pain. LDH is rare in children and adolescents and generally presents with low back pain, with&#xD;
      or without radiculopathy. The condition is usually unilateral (especially L4-5 or L5-S1). LDH&#xD;
      is also mostly central type. Although there are many studies that have investigated the&#xD;
      relationship between paraspinal muscle volumes and LBP and/or LDH in the adult age group,&#xD;
      there are very few studies in adolescents. The principal aim of this study was to compare MF,&#xD;
      ES, and PM volumes in adolescents with LBP with and without LDH using magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and to determine whether these two conditions cause paraspinal muscle volume&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;

      The medical records of 229 patients who underwent MRI due to low back pain persisting for a&#xD;
      minimum of twelve weeks between January 2018 and January 2020 were evaluated retrospectively.&#xD;
      Twenty-four patients were excluded due to the presence of spondylolysis-listhesis, spinal&#xD;
      alignment disorders including scoliosis and kyphosis, inflammatory diseases, or histories of&#xD;
      spinal surgery and multilevel disc hernia. Two hundred five patients were finally enrolled.&#xD;
      Age, gender, weight, and height were recorded, and BMI was calculated as weight/(height)Â².&#xD;
      Participants were divided into two groups - with LDH (Group A) and without LDH (Group B).&#xD;
      Right- and left-side PS, MF, and ES muscle volumes at intervertebral disc levels L4-L5 and&#xD;
      L5-S1 were measured on Axial T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences. All cross-sectional images&#xD;
      at both levels (L4-5 and L5-S1) were generated by means of multiplanar reformat images. The&#xD;
      muscles were identified by means of manual contouring at both disc levels. The fat components&#xD;
      were then eliminated by application of the threshold technique, based on visual differences&#xD;
      in pixel signal intensities. Volume measurement from cross-sectional images was based on the&#xD;
      use of an automatic volume calculation tool.&#xD;
