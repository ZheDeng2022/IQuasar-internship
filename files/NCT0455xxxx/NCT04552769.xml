      Primary Objective The primary objective is to determine the overall response rate after&#xD;
      treatment with abemaciclib in patients with anaplastic thyroid/undifferentiated thyroid&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives are to describe the overall survival (OS) and&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment with abemaciclib in patients with anaplastic&#xD;
      thyroid/undifferentiated thyroid cancer.Safety assessments of AE's will also be analysed&#xD;

             or become intolerant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients will be eligible if they meet either criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unresectable anaplastic thyroid cancer limited to the neck: Patients must have&#xD;
                  received radiation therapy or surgery to primary tumor and have subsequent&#xD;
                  evidence of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer: either with entirely surgically removed&#xD;
                  cancer/metastatic only disease, or with disease in the neck not requiring&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients with a bulky thyroid/neck mass and those in whom airway obstruction is&#xD;
             suspected should undergo an evaluation via indirect or direct laryngoscopy to ensure&#xD;
             patency of the trachea/airway prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients will not have any other curative therapeutic option, such as radiation or&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a&#xD;
             tumor lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days)&#xD;
             prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples&#xD;
             cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an&#xD;
             archived sample.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Patients who received chemotherapy must have recovered (Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
             for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade ≤1) from the acute effects of chemotherapy except for&#xD;

             washout period of at least 21 days is required between last chemotherapy dose and&#xD;
             study treatment start (provided the patient did not receive radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the&#xD;
             acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 14 days is required&#xD;

             is not required for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of&#xD;

             cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Presence or history of a malignant disease other than thyroid cancer that has been&#xD;
             diagnosed and/or required therapy within the past year and is undergoing active&#xD;
             anticancer treatment. Exceptions to this exclusion include the following: completely&#xD;
