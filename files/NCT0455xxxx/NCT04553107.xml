    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to implement a pharmacist-led deprescribing intervention for&#xD;
      adults 65 and older taking 10 or more medications at University of Texas (UT) Physicians&#xD;
      clinics and to assess the effect of the pharmacist intervention on the incidence of adverse&#xD;
      drug reactions, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations as well as costs to the patient&#xD;
      and to the healthcare system in adults 65 and older taking 10 or more medications treated at&#xD;
      UT Physicians.&#xD;
