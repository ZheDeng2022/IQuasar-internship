    <textblock>
      For bulbar urethral strictures, it remains unclear whether ventral onlay graft urethroplasty&#xD;
      is non-inferior to dorsal onlay graft urethroplasty in terms of patency rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urethral stricture disease is a common urological condition in men. Although rigorous&#xD;
      epidemiologic data is sparse, the existing papers report an incidence varying between 0.6 and&#xD;
      1.4 percent1. Urethral strictures can occur throughout the entire length of the urethra, but&#xD;
      mainly involve the anterior urethra and, in particular, the bulbar segment2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Consultation on Urologic Diseases (ICUD) recommends anastomotic repair (AR)&#xD;
      urethroplasty for isolated, short, bulbar urethral strictures3. However, AR urethroplasty is&#xD;
      only possible up to a certain point of stricture length. The elasticity of the bulbar urethra&#xD;
      is estimated to be about 25% and given the average bulbar urethral length of 10 cm, one could&#xD;
      simply calculate that strictures up to 2.5 cm can be treated with AR urethroplasty. However,&#xD;
      this border of 2.5 cm is rather arbitrary as additional length may be gained through the&#xD;
      different maneuvers of Webster et al., enabling the option of AR for even longer strictures4.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the location of the stricture within the bulbar segment plays an important role&#xD;
      as well: a proximal bulbar stricture location allows AR for longer strictured segments (&gt; 2.5&#xD;
      cm) than a more distal stricture location which nears the penoscrotal angle. Anyhow, the key&#xD;
      for a successful AR procedure is to perform a well-vascularized and tension-free&#xD;
      anastomosis5. Whenever this is impossible to achieve, even after performing the&#xD;
      length-gaining maneuvers of Webster et al., it is recommended to perform a so-called&#xD;
      'substitution urethroplasty' in which the strictured area of the urethra is opened and&#xD;
      augmented with a free graft or a pedicled flap5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the option of substitution urethroplasty, free graft urethroplasty (FGU) definitely&#xD;
      represents the easiest and most straightforward treatment option. Herein, urethral surgeons&#xD;
      initially started by placing grafts ventrally 'on' the urethra: 'ventral onlay FGU'. Later,&#xD;
      Barbagli et al. started placing grafts dorsally: 'dorsal onlay FGU'6. They advocated that&#xD;
      this dorsal graft position would lead to better graft anchorage, less graft mobility and less&#xD;
      graft sacculation. However, to date, there is no indisputable data to support the choice of&#xD;
      one technique over another, not from a surgical point of view, nor from a functional point of&#xD;
      view7. Furthermore, studies investigating this issue are mostly retrospective and thus only&#xD;
      entail a low level of evidence7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against this background, the aim of the DoVe trial is to directly compare dorsal onlay and&#xD;
      ventral onlay FGU for both surgical and functional outcome.&#xD;
