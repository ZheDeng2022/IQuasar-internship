    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to train mental health providers (MHPs) at lesbian, gay,&#xD;
      bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community centers across the United States in&#xD;
      evidence-based, LGBTQ-affirmative cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to train mental health providers (MHPs) at LGBTQ&#xD;
      community centers across the United States in evidence-based, LGBTQ-affirmative&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the LGBTQ-affirmative CBT&#xD;
      training increases LGBTQ and CBT knowledge, clinical skills, and cultural humility among a&#xD;
      sample of MHPs from LGBTQ community centers in the U.S. The proposed prospective study will&#xD;
      follow a 2-arm waitlist randomized-controlled trial design where one group of MHPs will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive the intervention training (i.e., the immediate training group) in&#xD;
      LGBTQ-affirmative CBT, and the second group of MHPs will be randomized to a waitlist control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed mixed-methods study will consist of predominantly quantitative self-report&#xD;
      measures, as well as a qualitative self-assessment of participants' LGBTQ-affirmative CBT&#xD;
      clinical skills. All study measures will be administered online at three time points via the&#xD;
      secure Yale Qualtrics survey software.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Familiarity and Use of LGBTQ-Affirmative CBT Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Familiarity and use of LGBTQ-affirmative CBT skills will be measured using a self-developed questionnaire by the researchers for the purpose of this study. This questionnaire consists of 14 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale for each item. An overall score of 70 (sum of all items) would be the highest possible score on the questionnaire and would indicate a high level of familiarity and use of LGBTQ-affirmative CBT skills.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Reported LGBTQ Clinical Skills Competency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Competency in LGBTQ clinical skills will be measured using the Sexual Orientation Counselor Competency Scale (SOCCS) - Clinical Skills subscale. This subscale consists of 11-items from a psychometrically validated measure, based on a 7-point Likert scale assessing the extent to which respondents endorse clinical competence as related to their skills in working with clients of diverse sexual identities. For the present study, items have been adapted to specifically assess competence in clinical skills based on an LGBTQ-affirmative CBT framework. An overall score of 7 (arithmetic mean of all 11 items) would be the highest possible score and would indicate a high level of competence in LGBTQ clinical skills.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Applied LGBTQ Clinical Skills Competency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Competency in LGBTQ clinical skills will also be measured by asking participants to provide responses to videos of fictional LGBTQ clients. Participants will watch 2 brief video clips (less than 1 minute each) of fictional clients presenting concerns that they would like to address in psychotherapy. Participants will then be asked to write a brief paragraph describing what clinical approaches they would use in their clinical treatment in order to address the challenges discussed by the fictional client. These written responses will be rated based on a 2-point scale in order to determine participants' LGBTQ-affirmative CBT skills. An overall rating score of 8 (on both videos) would be the highest possible score and would indicate a high level of competence in LGBTQ clinical skills.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in LGBTQ Cultural Humility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>LGBTQ cultural humility will be measured using the Multidimensional Cultural Humility Scale (MCHS). This questionnaire is a 15-item self-report psychometrically validated measure assessing the extent to which respondents endorse an ability to maintain an other-oriented, interpersonal stance in relation to cultural identities most salient to clients. For the present study, items were adapted to specifically assess cultural humility as related to working with LGBTQ clients. An overall score of 90 (sum of all items) would be the highest possible score on the questionnaire and would indicate a high level of LGBTQ cultural humility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Content Knowledge of Minority Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Content knowledge of minority stress will be measured using a self-developed, 10-item multiple-choice measure by the researchers for the purpose of this study. An overall score of 10 (i.e., answering all 10-items correctly) would be the highest possible score on the measure and would indicate a high level of content knowledge of minority stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Content Knowledge of CBT/LGBTQ-Affirmative CBT</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Content knowledge of CBT/LGBTQ-affirmative CBT will be measured using a self-developed, 10-item multiple-choice measure by the researchers for the purpose of this study. An overall score of 10 (i.e., answering all 10-items correctly) would be the highest possible score on the measure and would indicate a high level of content knowledge of CBT/LGBTQ-affirmative CBT.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of LGBTQ-affirmative CBT training</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months (for immediate training group / 6 months (for waitlist control group)</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of LGBTQ-affirmative CBT will measured using a self-developed questionnaire by the researchers. Participants will be asked to report how many of the 11 training sessions they attended. Participants will then be asked 2 qualitative questions in regard to which of the 11 training sessions they found most and least helpful. Participants will also be asked 7 questions based on a 5-point Likert scale regarding their interest and perceived benefit from the training. An overall score of 35 (sum of all items) on the Likert scale items would be the highest possible score on the measure and would indicate a high level of perceived acceptability of the LGBTQ-affirmative CBT training.</description>
