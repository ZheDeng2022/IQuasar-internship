      Primary aim is to provide a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the investigational&#xD;
      topical formula, KGF-HS, as a prophylactic treatment for chemotherapy induced alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: KGF-HS will result in less than 50% hair loss by the end of 4 cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The investigators will evaluate hair loss using the CTCAE (Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events) v4.0 alopecia grading scale.&#xD;

      Primary specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To provide a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the investigational topical&#xD;
           formula, KGF-HS, as a prophylactic treatment for chemotherapy induced alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: KGF-HS will result in less than 50% hair loss by the end of 4 cycles of&#xD;
           chemotherapy. The investigators will evaluate hair loss using the CTCAE (Common&#xD;
           Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v4.0 alopecia grading scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate hair preservation as assessed by participant and physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate participant reported comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the incidence of adverse events for topical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate if topical hair serum results in faster hair growth after completion of&#xD;
           chemotherapy in those who had grade 2 or higher alopecia while on chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To evaluate responses to chemotherapy at time of surgery (for patients undergoing&#xD;
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC))&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This study is a 2-part trial. For part 1 of the study, subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled into a prospective single arm phase where all of them get the study treatment.&#xD;
      Investigators plan to enroll up to 25 subjects to have 20 evaluable subjects to this phase.&#xD;
      At the end of 4 cycles of chemotherapy, primary efficacy end point data will be collected.&#xD;
      After 20 evaluable subjects if ≥ 4 responses were noted, part 2 of the study will be&#xD;
      activated. The decision rule is based on the lower bound of a one-sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval; at least 4 out of 20 patients with response results in a lower bound greater than&#xD;
      5% success. The proportion with success and the lower bound of a one-sided exact confidence&#xD;
      interval will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study is a randomized double blind-placebo controlled trial. Investigators plan&#xD;
      to randomize 40 subjects 1:1 to this portion. This sample size was selected to provide 82%&#xD;
      statistical power to detect an improvement from a 5% response rate in the control arm to a&#xD;
      35% response rate in the treated arm (assuming a one-sided alpha level of 0.05). Primary&#xD;
      efficacy end point will be assessed by clinicians who will be independent and unaware of the&#xD;
      study treatment. Participant withdrawals from the study will be deemed treatment failures.&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy end points are success in hair preservation assessed by participant's&#xD;
      clinician and by the participant, use of wigs and/or head wraps; participant-reported&#xD;
      comfort; and quality of life (QOL). Comparison of the proportions between the treated and&#xD;
      control arms will be performed using a chi-square test; the confidence interval for the&#xD;
      difference between the proportions will be estimated. Comparison of differences in mean&#xD;
      quality of life scores will be performed using two sample independent t tests. Adverse events&#xD;
      will be reported by grade and tabulated. In phase 1 part of the study, the number of patients&#xD;
      undergoing NAC and responses at time of surgery will be noted. No formal statistics will be&#xD;
      done. In phase 2 part of the study, proportion of patients undergoing neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy and their responses at time of surgery will be recorded and comparisons will be&#xD;
      done by chi-square test. Investigators do not anticipate the study serum to influence&#xD;
      response to chemotherapy as there is no significant systemic absorption however since KGF is&#xD;
      a cytoprotective agent, investigators will collect data on response to chemotherapy (for&#xD;
      patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment only).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Four months</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) will be used to assess anxiety and depression. It includes 7 questions to assess anxiety and 7 to assess depression. The summary scores (sum of the 7 question items) for anxiety and depression range from 0 to 21: scores of 0 to 7 are considered normal, 8 to 10 are considered borderline abnormal (borderline case), and 11 to 21 are considered abnormal (case). Missing items will be replaced by the average of non-missing items if only 1 item from the anxiety or depression scale was missing.</description>

    <description>The BIS (Body Image Scale) summary score will be the sum of the first 9 (of 10) items in the BIS. The last item in the BIS for scar is not applicable to the study participants, so it will not be included. The summary score ranges from 0 to 27; a score of 0 indicates no symptoms or distress, and a higher score indicated increasing symptoms or distress. Missing items will be replaced by the average of non-missing items if only 1 or 2 items from the 9 items in the BIS are missing.</description>
