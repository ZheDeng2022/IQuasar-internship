  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial electrical stimulation (tCES) is a non-invasive and safe treatment, which uses a&#xD;
      low direct current or alternating current to change the excitability of the cerebral cortex.&#xD;
      The tCES has been applied in clinical trials related to rehabilitation research in recent&#xD;
      years, and the safety and effectiveness have also been established. However, the existing&#xD;
      tCES products effect on the whole brain networks and lack special waveforms. The&#xD;
      investigators developed a wearable high-definition tCES (HD-tCES) with special waveforms.&#xD;
      This novel stimulation system will result in more precise and focal stimulation of selected&#xD;
      brain regions with special waveforms to display better neuromodulation performance. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators will preliminarily examine the effects and safety of the HD-tCES in&#xD;
      patients with fibromyalgia. The investigators expect that the HD-tCES will relief pain,&#xD;
      improve sleep quality, emotion, and general health of the patients.&#xD;

    <description>The high definition transcranial electrical stimulation was applied using a 1*4 ring electrode configuration. The electrode will be applied at the left M1 or contralateral to pain side. The anodal electrode was placed on the C3/C4, and the remaining 4 cathodal electrodes were placed in a radius of approximately 7.5 cm from anode (Cz, F3, T7, and P3 on the left hemisphere or Cz, F4, T8, and P4 on the right hemisphere). HD-tCES will be applied for 20 minutes at an intensity of 1.0 mA direct current stimulation and a specific-added waveform each time, 5 times a week, lasting for 2 weeks.</description>
