  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rib fractures are one of the most common injuries in trauma patients. These fractures are&#xD;
      associated with significant pain as well as decreased ability to inspire deeply or cough to&#xD;
      clear secretions, which together lead to complications of the lungs and breathing which leads&#xD;
      to risks of further injury and even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One recent study found that the ability to move air into and out of the lungs practically&#xD;
      doubled with the administration of a single-injection Erector Spainae Plane Block (ESPB)&#xD;
      while pain levels nearly halved. However, a single-injection nerve block lasts less than 24&#xD;
      hours while a perineural local anesthetic infusion (also termed a &quot;continuous peripheral&#xD;
      nerve block&quot;) may be administered for multiple days. This entails inserting a tiny tube&#xD;
      through the skin and into the area around the nerves, after which more local anesthetic may&#xD;
      be administered prolonging the numbing effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility of extending the duration of a ESPB with local anesthetic administration via&#xD;
      a perineural catheter has not be investigated. We therefore are conducting a randomized,&#xD;
      triple-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study to investigate the addition of a&#xD;
      continuous ESPB to a single-injection ESPB following traumatic rib fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study will be the maximum inspired volume measured by incentive&#xD;
      spirometry on the afternoon following the nerve block procedure. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      maximum inspired volume will be significantly increased in the afternoon following the&#xD;
      procedure with the addition of a continuous ESPB to a single-injection ESPB.&#xD;

      Rib fractures are one of the most common injuries in trauma patients. These fractures are&#xD;
      associated with significant pain as well as decreased ability to inspire deeply or cough to&#xD;
      clear secretions, which together lead to complications of the lungs and breathing which leads&#xD;
      to risks of further injury and even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a nerve block that covers multiple rib fractures&#xD;
      with a single injection. This block entails injecting local anesthetic in the back&#xD;
      superficial to the vertebral bodies. One study found that the ability to move air into and&#xD;
      out of the lungs practically doubled with the administration of a single-injection ESPB while&#xD;
      pain levels nearly halved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-injection nerve block lasts less than 24 hours while a perineural local anesthetic&#xD;
      infusion (also termed a &quot;continuous peripheral nerve block&quot;) may be administered for multiple&#xD;
      days. This entails inserting a tiny tube through the skin and into the area around the&#xD;
      nerves, after which more local anesthetic may be administered prolonging the numbing effects.&#xD;
      The possibility of extending the duration of a ESPB with local anesthetic administration via&#xD;
      a perineural catheter has not be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore are conducting a randomized, tripe-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm&#xD;
      study to investigate the addition of a continuous ESPB to a single-injection ESPB following&#xD;
      traumatic rib fracture. Subjects will be individuals who present with rib fracture(s) and&#xD;
      significant pain. Those who consent to participate in this study will have an ESP catheter&#xD;
      inserted using ultrasound-guidance on the ipsilateral side at the level of the inferior-most&#xD;
      fracture. For bilateral fractures, a second catheter will also be inserted on the remaining&#xD;
      side. The single-injection ESPB will be administered to each catheter with 20 mL of&#xD;
      ropivacaine 0.5% (with epinephrine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with an accurately-inserted catheter based on visualization of local anesthetic&#xD;
      spread will be allocated to one of two possible perineural treatments stratified by&#xD;
      unilateral vs. bilateral fractures (1:1 ratio in blocks of 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. active (ropivacaine 0.3%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. placebo (normal saline)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer-generated randomization lists will be created by the UCSD Investigational Drug&#xD;
      Service which will keep the randomization lists and not release them to the investigators&#xD;
      until the study is completed, at which time they will provide lists of subjects who received&#xD;
      &quot;Treatment A&quot; and &quot;Treatment B&quot; so that the statistician can analyze the data. Only after the&#xD;
      analysis is complete will &quot;Treatment A&quot; and &quot;Treatment B&quot; be defined for the investigators&#xD;
      for manuscript preparation [producing a triple-masked study]. Of note, for bilateral&#xD;
      catheters the treatments on both sides will always be identical: each subject will be&#xD;
      randomized to a single treatment and not each side of bilateral cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a basal infusion of study fluid (ropivacaine vs. placebo) 1 mL/h to&#xD;
      keep the catheter lumen patent as soon as the infusion pump is initiated with a 500 mL&#xD;
      reservoir. In addition, intermittent boluses (13 mL programmed automatic bolus every 2 hours)&#xD;
      will begin 5 hours after pump initiation. For bilateral catheters, a 6-hour delay for one of&#xD;
      the pumps will ensure that the pair of pumps alternate sides for the bolus doses each hour.&#xD;
      This protocol will provide nearly 71-72 hours of study fluid administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following local anesthetic reservoir exhaustion, subjects or their caretakers will remove the&#xD;
      catheters with instructions provided by phone. This is standard at UC San Diego for all&#xD;
      ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve blocks and will not be unique to study participation.&#xD;
      The catheter is disposable in the trash and the infusion pump will be returned using a&#xD;
      pre-addressed and postage-paid envelope provided to subjects prior to leaving the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted by telephone to collect study data on post procedure days 1, 2, 7,&#xD;
      and at months 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate objective of the proposed line of research is to determine if the addition of a&#xD;
      continuous ESPB to a single-injection ESPB prolongs analgesia following traumatic rib&#xD;
      fractures; and, if this analgesic intervention improves pulmonary mechanics measured with&#xD;
      incentive spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if the addition of a continuous ESPB to a single-injection ESPB&#xD;
      improves maximum inspiratory volume following traumatic rib fracture(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: The maximum inspired volume will be significantly increased in the afternoon&#xD;
      following the procedure [primary endpoint] as well as at other time points following the&#xD;
      procedure [secondary end points] with the addition of a continuous ESPB to a single-injection&#xD;
      ESPB [measured with an incentive spirometer].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: The maximum inspired volume as a percentage of the baseline will be&#xD;
      significantly increased in the afternoon following the procedure [secondary endpoint of&#xD;
      greatest interest], as well as at other time points following the procedure [secondary end&#xD;
      points] with the addition of a continuous ESPB to a single-injection ESPB [measured with an&#xD;
      incentive spirometer].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if the addition of a continuous ESPB to a single-injection ESPB&#xD;
      decreases the pain associated with rib fracture(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: The severity of rib fracture pain at rest will be significantly decreased&#xD;
      within the 12 months following the procedure with the addition of a continuous ESPB to a&#xD;
      single-injection ESPB [measured using the Numeric Rating Scale for pain].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b: The severity of rib fracture pain when using the spirometer or coughing will&#xD;
      be significantly decreased within the 12 months following the procedure with the addition of&#xD;
      a continuous ESPB to a single-injection ESPB [measured using the Numeric Rating Scale for&#xD;
      pain].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2c: The incidence of chronic rib fracture pain will be significantly decreased 6&#xD;
      and 12 months following a rib fracture with the addition of a continuous ESPB to a&#xD;
      single-injection ESPB [measured using the Numeric Rating Scale for pain].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2d: The severity of chronic rib fracture pain will be significantly decreased 6&#xD;
      and 12 months following a rib fracture with the addition of a continuous ESPB to a&#xD;
      single-injection ESPB [measured using the Numeric Rating Scale for pain].&#xD;
