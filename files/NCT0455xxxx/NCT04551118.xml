    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES)&#xD;
      on emotion processing of healthy participants. Meanwhile, the investigators evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of tES on electroencephalography (EEG) of both resting and task-related signal. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of this study is that tES can improve the cognitive function of emotion by&#xD;
      modulating brain activity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled study using transcranial Electrical&#xD;
      Stimulation (tES) for 7-day treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to transcranial&#xD;
      alternating current stimulation (tACS) group, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
      group or sham-control group. Active tES comprised 20 min sessions of 1.5 mA peak-to-peak&#xD;
      current delivered over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, for 7 consecutive days. Sham group&#xD;
      was administered similarly, but with current turned off after 30s. Apart from studying the&#xD;
      effects of tES on physiology signals, subjective scale assessments and behavioral data are&#xD;
      performed before and after the treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>The change of event-related potentials (ERPs) before and after stimulation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day1, Day7</time_frame>
    <description>The aim is to explore whether tES have a regulation effect on emotion processing of dynamic course. In the task, participants need to concentrate on the emotional picture with positive, negative and neutral faces. Then, different ERP components elicited by positive, negative and neutral faces using the signals recorded during facial emotion identification task. The investigators will analyze the ERP components change before and after stimulation to access tES effect on emotion processing.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of resting EEG power and lateralization index before and after stimulation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day1, Day7</time_frame>
    <description>The aim is to explore whether tES have a regulation effect at-risk of frequency domain. In the resting task, 8 mins resting EEG will be recorded. During recording, participants need to remain still and relaxed with their eyes open (O) and closed (C) in two alternating orders. In order to access tES effect on resting EEG, spectral analysis will be executed after the experiment. Analysis in frequency domain also contributed to expound the brain mechanism related cerebral cortex in emotion processing. In specific, EEG power of delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma band would be calculated after recording. Besides, the EEG lateralization index also be analyzed between left and right brain.</description>

    <measure>The change of scores in subjective scale measurement of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory from pre- to post-stimulation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day1, Day7</time_frame>
    <description>The main objective is to explore whether tES has an effect on subjective scale after stimulation. The scales include State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). The STAI is a brief self-report assessment for trait anxiety and state measurement. The scales contain two 20-item pools of emotional state and personality trait, each item rated on a 4-point intensity scale ranging from not at all to very much so or from never to almost always respectively. DERS, on the other hand, is also a self-report measure function to assess the emotion regulation.</description>

    <description>The aim is to explore whether tES have a regulation effect on emotion identification task. During the task, participants need to respond as quickly as probable to emotional stimuli by pressing the space bar. Reaction time and accuracy from the facial emotion identification task pre- and post-stimulation would be recorded. After the experiment, the investigators will access the stimulation effect on their behavioral data change.</description>
