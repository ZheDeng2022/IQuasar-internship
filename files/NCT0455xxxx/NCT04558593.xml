  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One third of individuals aged &gt;60 years will be diagnosed with at least one renal cyst&#xD;
      following abdominal imaging. These cystic lesions are categorized according to the Bosniak&#xD;
      classification which categorizes cysts according to their degree of complexity and risk of&#xD;
      malignancy. Growing evidence suggests that a significant proportion of Bosniak III and IV&#xD;
      cysts are benign and that the malignant ones present low metastatic potential. Since renal&#xD;
      surgery carries substantial morbidity (20%) and potential mortality (0.5%), active&#xD;
      surveillance has gained attention as a potential tradeoff to surgery to overcome&#xD;
      overtreatment. Therefore, prospective studies of long-term follow-up are needed to confirm&#xD;
      the oncologic safety of this strategy for patients with Bosniak III/IV cysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an multicenter prospective observational longitudinal study. The main objective is to&#xD;
      compare the 5-year follow-up cancer-specific survival between the active surveillance and the&#xD;
      surgical groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: One in three patients over 60 years old will be diagnosed with a renal cyst&#xD;
      following abdominal imaging. Traditionally, experts have recommended that complex cystic&#xD;
      lesions (also known as Bosniak III - IV cysts) should be surgically removed, but recent&#xD;
      evidences suggest that many are benign or have low metastatic potential. Thus, active&#xD;
      surveillance which involves close follow-up of a patient's condition, was proposed as a&#xD;
      tradeoff option to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Multicenter observational longitudinal prospective cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The goal of this multicenter project is to conduct a prospective study with a&#xD;
      5-year follow-up to confirm the oncologic outcomes of active surveillance in the management&#xD;
      of complex cysts. The main objectives are: 1) to compare the 5-year cancer specific survival&#xD;
      between cysts managed by surgery and active surveillance; 2) to evaluate disease progression;&#xD;
      3) to evaluate patient's well-being according to each management strategy; and 4) to compare&#xD;
      the 5-year healthcare cost of both management approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients incidentally diagnosed with a Bosniak III and/or IV cysts, who are&#xD;
      deemed to have at least 5 years of life, and who opted to be managed by either surgery or&#xD;
      active surveillance. (N=330)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Patients will DECIDE if they want to have a surgery or to be followed by active&#xD;
      surveillance. All patients will be followed as per standard of care with either semi-annual&#xD;
      and annual visits. Research visits will serve to evaluate vital status and quality of life&#xD;
      scores (through validated questionnaires). Patients on active surveillance will also be&#xD;
      assessed for cyst progression and will be offered invasive or systemic therapy if progression&#xD;
      is observed.&#xD;
