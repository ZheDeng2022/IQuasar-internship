  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study involves conducting a larger-scale study exploring Game Plan's effects&#xD;
      among MSM in the real-world, alongside innovative approaches for expanding HIV testing. Using&#xD;
      a hybrid 1 effectiveness-implementation approach, the investigators will recruit up to 500&#xD;
      high-risk, heavy drinking MSM online from several high-incidence areas in the US to&#xD;
      participate in a program providing home-based HIV/STI self-tests in the mail at regular&#xD;
      intervals over a year (baseline, 6 months, 12 months). Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive access to either (1) a 24-hour helpline for counseling/referrals, or (2) the&#xD;
      helpline plus Game Plan. Investigators will test whether those who use Game Plan show lower&#xD;
      rates of heavy drinking, any STIs, and high-risk CAS events compared to those receiving&#xD;
      access to the helpline alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a hybrid 1 effectiveness-implementation, mixed methods study that involves conducting&#xD;
      a longitudinal randomized controlled trial in which high-risk, heavy drinking MSM (N = 500)&#xD;
      will be recruited online from several high-incidence US cities: Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami,&#xD;
      New Orleans, Washington DC/Baltimore. Participants will be sent HIV and STI self-testing kits&#xD;
      at baseline, 6 mo., and 12 mo. Along with their test kits, they will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      access to either: (1) a 24-hour helpline providing free standard post-test counseling and&#xD;
      referral, or (2) the 24-hour helpline plus the Game Plan app. Test kits will provide testing&#xD;
      and results for HIV, Syphilis, and genital, rectal, and pharyngeal Gonorrhea and Chlamydia,&#xD;
      as well as phosphatidylethanol (PEth). Participants will also be asked to complete an online&#xD;
      follow-up survey every three months that assess drinking, sexual behavior, and use of&#xD;
      prevention methods over the 12-month study period. At 12 mo., 30 participants and 12 HST&#xD;
      stakeholders will be recruited to participate in qualitative interviews to issues relevant to&#xD;
      implementing Game Plan alongside HIV testing programs. Specifically, this study aims to: (1)&#xD;
      test whether using a brief, MI-inspired, web-based intervention (Game Plan) after HST reduces&#xD;
      (a) binge drinking, (b) the average number of drinks per drinking day over 12 months among&#xD;
      heavy-drinking and high-risk, HIV-negative MSM, compared to providing access to a 24h&#xD;
      helpline providing risk-reduction counseling alone, (2) test whether using Game Plan results&#xD;
      in lower rates of (a) bacterial STIs, (b) high-risk CAS, and (c) higher rates of PrEP uptake&#xD;
      over 12 months, and (3) to assess Game Plan's potential for implementation into self-testing&#xD;
      programs by examining indicators of adoption, engagement, appropriateness and satisfaction&#xD;
      among MSM assigned to have access to the site. Investigators will use site metrics and&#xD;
      responses, survey data, and in-depth qualitative interview data from users and virtual focus&#xD;
      groups with stakeholders to help address key implementation questions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 to one of two conditions: (1) a 24-hour helpline providing free standard post-test counseling and referral, or (2) the 24-hour helpline plus the Game Plan app. In both conditions, participants will be encouraged to use these services via a large postcard included in each test kit and via email, and so, can use them after each test.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>All key study personnel will be blinded to participants' condition assignments. Since participants are encouraged to complete both STI self-testing and follow-up online surveys via automated emails linking to a web-based survey system, no members of the study staff will be serving as outcomes assessors. As such, outcomes assessment is also blinded to study condition.</masking_description>
