  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some adults are at a higher risk of feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) after they&#xD;
      have surgery. In this study, these adults will have planned surgery. The main aim of this&#xD;
      study is to learn if TAK-951 stops these adults from getting nausea or vomiting after&#xD;
      surgery. This will be compared with another medicine called ondansetron. Another aim is to&#xD;
      check for side effects from the study medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, the study doctor will check who can take part in this study. Those who can&#xD;
      take part will be picked for either Treatment Group A or Treatment Group B by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group A: Just before surgery, participants will receive a placebo slowly&#xD;
           through a vein (infusion). Just before the end of the surgery, they will receive TAK-951&#xD;
           as an injection under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group B: Just before surgery, participants will receive ondansetron slowly&#xD;
           through a vein (infusion). Just before the end of the surgery, they will receive a&#xD;
           placebo as an injection under the skin. In this study, a placebo will look like TAK-951&#xD;
           but will not have any medicine in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not know which study medicines they received, or in which order, nor will&#xD;
      their study doctors or surgeons. This is to help make sure the results are more reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital for 24 hours after their surgery so that the study&#xD;
      doctors can check for nausea and vomiting. The study doctors will also check for side effects&#xD;
      from the study medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the hospital for a check-up 14 days later.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-951. TAK-951 is being tested for&#xD;
      prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting in high-risk participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll a maximum of 160 patients, to allow a sample size of up to&#xD;
      approximately 100 participants who have received both doses of Double-blind study&#xD;
      drug/matching placebo. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either&#xD;
      Treatment Group A or Treatment Group B which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study&#xD;
      doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group A: Just before surgery, participants will receive a placebo slowly&#xD;
           through a vein (infusion). Just before the end of the surgery, they will receive TAK-951&#xD;
           as an injection under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group B: Just before surgery, participants will receive ondansetron slowly&#xD;
           through a vein (infusion). Just before the end of the surgery, they will receive a&#xD;
           placebo as an injection under the skin. In this study, a placebo will look like TAK-951&#xD;
           but will not have any medicine in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in the&#xD;
      study from the time of surgery to completion is approximately 14 days. Participants will make&#xD;
      multiple visits to the clinic and will be contacted by telephone after receiving their last&#xD;
      dose of the drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
