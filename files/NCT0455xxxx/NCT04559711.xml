  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition among women of reproductive age is a significant public health problem in&#xD;
      Bangladesh, with major implications for a woman's own health and that of her newborn child.&#xD;
      The principal drivers for maternal malnutrition in Bangladesh are poor-quality diets, care&#xD;
      seeking practices and access to health care. An ideal contact point for pregnant women are&#xD;
      antenatal care visits (ANC). However, the provision of maternal nutrition services through&#xD;
      government systems is inadequate with just 29% of pregnant women attending all 4 ANC visits&#xD;
      and 18% of women consuming at least 100 IFA tablets. Moreover, WHO made a context specific&#xD;
      recommendation that countries with a high prevalence of nutritional deficiencies may choose&#xD;
      to adopt multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) over iron folic acid (IFA). The health&#xD;
      benefits of MMS cannot be harnessed without a properly functioning delivery platform. A&#xD;
      multifaceted approach focusing on improving the quality of ANC, the supply system for these&#xD;
      services, engagement with communities, in addition to the adoption of MMS may have large&#xD;
      benefits to women and children in Bangladesh. UNICEF and the Bill and Melinda Gates&#xD;
      Foundation have partnered with several different organizations, including the GoB, Sight &amp;&#xD;
      Life, Pennsylvania State University (PSU) and icddr, b to design and assess outcome of a&#xD;
      community based randomized control trial to improve coverage and quality of maternal&#xD;
      nutrition service delivery through ANC platform. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      implementation of demonstration programme will result in 60% relative improvement in the&#xD;
      coverage of 100+ MMS among women who received 4+ANC in the intervention areas compared to the&#xD;
      coverage of 100+ IFA among women who received 4+ANC in comparison areas.&#xD;

      1. Burden:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Globally, it is recognized that pre-conception and during pregnancy malnutrition among&#xD;
           women is an underlying cause of maternal morbidity, mortality, and poor birth outcomes&#xD;
           including low birth weight babies. In Bangladesh, the poor pre-conception and pregnancy&#xD;
           nutritional status of women contributes to the prevailing high rates of low birth weight&#xD;
           among newborns. Each year, approximately 860,000 or 28% of babies are born with low&#xD;
           birth weight (&lt;2500g) greatly increasing their risk of stunting and wasting, and&#xD;
           diet-related non-communicable diseases in adult life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Knowledge gap:&#xD;
&#xD;
           An ideal contact point for pregnant women for delivering nutrition services are&#xD;
           antenatal care visits (ANC). However, the provision of maternal nutrition services&#xD;
           through government systems is inadequate in terms of coverage and quality. Overall 29%&#xD;
           of pregnant women in Bangladesh receive 4 ANC and 18% of women consume at least 100 IFA&#xD;
           tablets. Moreover recent WHO context specific recommendation suggest countries with a&#xD;
           high prevalence of nutritional deficiencies may choose to adopt multiple micronutrient&#xD;
           supplementation (MMS) over iron folic acid (IFA). The health benefits of MMS cannot be&#xD;
           harnessed without a properly functioning delivery platform. A multifaceted approach&#xD;
           focusing on improving the quality of ANC, the supply system for these services,&#xD;
           engagement with communities, in addition to the adoption of MMS may have large benefits&#xD;
           to women and children in Bangladesh. UNICEF and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation&#xD;
           have partnered with several different organizations, including the GoB and icddr, b to&#xD;
           build a comprehensive understanding of where gaps in ANC and nutritional care delivery&#xD;
           currently exist, how to bridge these gaps, strengthen both the supply and service&#xD;
           system, engage with a larger number of pregnant women, and finally encourage the&#xD;
           adoption of the programme across Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most recent State of Food Security and Nutrition in Bangladesh Report found that 66% of&#xD;
      women did not consume adequately diversified diets, indicating micronutrient deficiencies. A&#xD;
      growing body of evidence has found that multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) may&#xD;
      result in better neonatal outcomes for undernourished pregnant women. MMS has been associated&#xD;
      with reductions in the number of LBW and small for gestational age (SGA) births, as well as a&#xD;
      reduction in the number of preterm births among mothers who were underweight in both&#xD;
      meta-analysis and a randomized control trial in Bangladesh. Recently in Dhaka, Bangladesh&#xD;
      national anaemia consultation workshop was held, which also recommended changing the&#xD;
      formulation from IFA only to a multi-micronutrient supplement for pregnant women and to scale&#xD;
      up providing children with MNPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two phases. The specific objectives are;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a comprehensive situation analysis to identify gaps in the existing maternal&#xD;
           nutrition service delivery and coverage of maternal nutrition interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To conduct a formative research to inform design of a demonstration programme improving&#xD;
           maternal nutrition service delivery through public health ANC platforms&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To implement a two parallel arm superiority community based cluster randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial (cRCT) to assess whether implementation of the demonstration programme&#xD;
           improves coverage and quality of nutrition service delivery through public health ANC&#xD;
           platforms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phase I,a comprehensive situation analysis and a formative research will be conducted&#xD;
      to inform the design of a demonstration programme improving maternal nutrition service&#xD;
      delivery through public health ANC platforms. The study will employ a quantitative approach&#xD;
      for comprehensive situation analysis involving health facility assessment, health care&#xD;
      provider interviews, ANC observation, exit interviews of the women receiving ANC and&#xD;
      household hold survey. The situation analysis will enable the investigators to identify the&#xD;
      gaps of in terms of coverage and quality of maternal nutrition services through public health&#xD;
      ANC platforms, knowledge, attitude and practices of the health care providers and pregnant&#xD;
      women regarding maternal nutrition. A formative research will be conducted to inform the&#xD;
      design of the demonstration programme. Demonstration programme will be designed based on the&#xD;
      findings from the baseline situation analysis and formative research. During Phase II, a two&#xD;
      parallel arm superiority community based cluster randomized control trial (cRCT) will be&#xD;
      implemented to assess whether implementation of the demonstration programme improves coverage&#xD;
      and quality of Nutrition services through public health ANC platforms. Unit of randomization&#xD;
      will be unions. A total of 40 unions will be selected from two districts and paired based on&#xD;
      principle component analysis (PCA) score. PCA will take into consideration coverage of ANC&#xD;
      and IFA and socio-demographics characteristics (literacy rate, provision of pure drinking&#xD;
      water, sanitation facilities). Later each of the pair will be randomized into either&#xD;
      intervention or comparison arm. Cross sectional surveys will be conducted to assess coverage&#xD;
      of key maternal health and nutrition indicators. Additionally a cohort of pregnant women from&#xD;
      intervention and comparison facilities will be followed to measure the change in quality of&#xD;
      nutrition service delivery and consumption of 100+ MMS tablets during pregnancy.&#xD;
