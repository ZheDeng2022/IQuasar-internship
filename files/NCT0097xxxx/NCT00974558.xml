  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate if the use of a handheld fan directed to the cheeks&#xD;
      alongside conventional medical treatment partially or totally relieves breathlessness and if&#xD;
      this effect lasts for at least 30 minutes in patients irrespective of the underlying disease&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A previous randomised controlled trial (Galbraith et al, accepted for publication) has shown&#xD;
      a reduction in breathlessness after 5 minutes use of a fan directed to the cheeks. This study&#xD;
      is a feasibility study to determine how long this beneficial effect lasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the patient in a relaxed sitting position and ensuring there is no other fan or open&#xD;
      window blowing air onto the subject, the following will be explained to the patient and then&#xD;
      measured and recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for dyspnoea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual analogue scale (VAS) for breathlessness with end anchors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  O2 saturation using pulse oximeter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse rate using pulse oximeter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Room temperature and humidity recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to avoid talking or significantly change position throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fan to cheeks The investigator will demonstrate to the patient how to use the handheld fan&#xD;
      directed to the cheeks. The appropriate area on the face, which corresponds to the area&#xD;
      innervated by 2nd and 3rd trigeminal nerve branches, will be demonstrated by the researcher.&#xD;
      The patient will then use the fan as demonstrated and this will be timed for 5 minutes with&#xD;
      the patient in a relaxed sitting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment following treatment with fan After 5 minutes use of the fan directed at cheeks,&#xD;
      the following will be recorded immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NRS and VAS for dyspnoea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relief score, a 5 point rating of how much relief from breathlessness the participant&#xD;
           has obtained (0=nil, 1= a little relief , 2= moderate relief, 3=good relief, 4=no longer&#xD;
           breathless/maximal relief)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  O2 saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have had no improvement in breathlessness as measured by VAS, NRS or gained&#xD;
      no relief assessed by the relief score will end the study at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have an improvement in breathlessness will continue the study and NRS and&#xD;
      VAS will to be recorded every 10 minutes in alternating order until the NRS or/and VAS have&#xD;
      returned to baseline values or reached a steady level.&#xD;
