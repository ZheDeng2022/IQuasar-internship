  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to increase the understanding of tinnitus through the identification of&#xD;
      potentially altered brain networks in patients who are able to voluntarily control or alter&#xD;
      their tinnitus. Upon completion of this study, new knowledge will be gained about the changes&#xD;
      in brain activity in people who are able to modify their tinnitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Certain patients report that they are able to modulate the loudness or pitch of their&#xD;
      tinnitus temporarily through various means, including attention re-direction or somatosensory&#xD;
      mechanisms such as oral facial movements or head turn. This subset of patients may represent&#xD;
      a unique opportunity for the researcher to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for&#xD;
      tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural activity in the brain has been linked to increases in blood flow and blood&#xD;
      oxygenation. These changes in the concentration of oxyhemoglobin versus deoxyhemoglobin alter&#xD;
      the magnetic resonance signal of blood which may then be detected using an appropriate MR&#xD;
      pulse sequence as blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. In addition to increases in&#xD;
      blood flow due to evoked neural activity, the brain exhibits continuous low frequency&#xD;
      spontaneous activity. These fluctuations tend to be synchronous in functionally related, but&#xD;
      spatially distinct, regions of the brain even when not performing a prescribed task. The&#xD;
      phrase functional connectivity has been used to implicate the neural activity that&#xD;
      facilitates the coordinated activity of functionally related brain regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to measure the&#xD;
      network of synchronous brain activity in patients with tinnitus. Several targeted networks&#xD;
      are those linked to the auditory system, attention, and control systems and the emotion&#xD;
      systems linked to prefrontal cortex. Previously, functional MRI (fMRI) used changes in blood&#xD;
      flow and blood oxygenation within the brain to detect which isolated regions of the brain&#xD;
      were active during a task. The goal of functional connectivity research is to describe a&#xD;
      pattern of interactions or a picture of the connectivity that occurs within distinct regions&#xD;
      of the brain when the individual is not involved in a task.&#xD;
