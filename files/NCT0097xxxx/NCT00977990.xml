      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polyomavirus are DNA-based viruses that infect vertebrates, including humans. Most&#xD;
           people are not harmed by polyomavirus infection, but people with compromised immune&#xD;
           systems may be harmed by these viruses, and are at greater risk for developing certain&#xD;
           types of rare cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A recently discovered virus called Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is a type of skin&#xD;
           infection commonly found in humans. By using skin swabs to collect MCV, researchers hope&#xD;
           to develop a laboratory culture model of MCV for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use skin swabs to collect samples of Merkel cell polyomavirus for future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who are employed in the National Cancer Institute's&#xD;
      Laboratory of Cellular Oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will wipe a cotton swab across their forehead and eyebrows, and break off&#xD;
           the end of the swab into a microcentrifuge tube. This procedure will be performed after&#xD;
           work hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No other treatment or procedure will be given as part of this protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Polyomaviruses are a class of DNA-based viruses that infect vertebrates, including humans. A&#xD;
      majority of humans are chronically infected with multiple polyomavirus types. In&#xD;
      immunocompetent subjects, chronic polyomavirus infection is generally harmless. A&#xD;
      recently-discovered virus called Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is believed to chronically&#xD;
      infect the skin of a substantial fraction of adult subjects. It has recently been shown that&#xD;
      MCV DNA can be amplified from skin swab specimens using PCR methods. The goal of our study is&#xD;
      to recover full-length (5.5 kb) MCV genomes from skin swab specimens taken from healthy&#xD;
      laboratory volunteers. We will recombine any recovered MCV genomes and attempt to propagate&#xD;
      them in cell culture. If successful, the work would provide the first laboratory culture&#xD;
      model for MCV replication. The recombinant DNA work has received approval from the NIH&#xD;
      Institutional Biosafety Committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study population would be drawn from roughly two dozen co-workers in the Lab of Cellular&#xD;
      Oncology's Building 37 Sections. LCO co-workers are an appealing study population because&#xD;
      they are generally familiar with the biology of MCV. Candidate study participants will be&#xD;
      reminded that, given the high prevalence of asymptomatic MCV infection among healthy adults,&#xD;
      the detection of MCV DNA in skin swabs clearly cannot be construed as having any diagnostic,&#xD;
      clinical or social significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who agree to participate in the study will wipe a cotton swab across their forehead&#xD;
      and eyebrows. Study subjects will break off the end of the swab into a microcentrifuge tube.&#xD;
      To avoid study participation during federal work hours, the specimen collection will be&#xD;
      performed prior to or after the study subject's work shift. Each sample will be assigned a&#xD;
      letter code. A key for the letter code will exist only in Dr. Buck's secure NCI server space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the non-invasive nature of the sampling and the clear lack of potential harm arising&#xD;
      from study participation, the proposal appears to be eligible for expedited review by the&#xD;
      IRB's Special Studies section.&#xD;
