      This study compared the effectiveness of inpatient routine VCT to referral for post-discharge&#xD;
      VCT in terms of the number of new HIV infections identified, linkage to care for HIV infected&#xD;
      individuals and reduction in HIV risk behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ambulatory HIV voluntary testing and counseling (VCT) has become a mainstay of HIV prevention&#xD;
      and linkage to care efforts. Despite expansion of these services in sub-Saharan Africa, most&#xD;
      individuals admitted for acute illnesses arrive in hospital unaware of their HIV serostatus.&#xD;
      Even then, inpatient risk reduction counseling services are not widely available and&#xD;
      utilization of HIV testing services in the hospital is rare; most HIV diagnoses are made&#xD;
      clinically without the benefit of counseling or antibody testing. The effectiveness of VCT&#xD;
      during hospitalization in high-prevalence, resource poor settings has never been formally&#xD;
      studied. It has been argued that the circumstances of hospitalization for HIV-associated&#xD;
      illness do not allow for the provision of VCT services in this setting: Patients may be too&#xD;
      sick to participate meaningfully in risk reduction counseling and the inpatient medical&#xD;
      management of acute illness may leave little time for the provision of VCT. There are also&#xD;
      several potentially significant differences between ambulatory and inpatient VCT that may&#xD;
      limit efficacy in the latter case. First, inpatient counseling during an acute illness may&#xD;
      not reduce risk behavior significantly due to competing priorities and messages communicated&#xD;
      to patients while in the hospital. Second, HIV risk behavior may already be so infrequent&#xD;
      among individuals with complications of advanced HIV disease that there is little margin for&#xD;
      further risk reduction. Third, providing VCT during acute hospitalization may not result in&#xD;
      effective linkage to existing outpatient follow-up medical care or community-based support&#xD;
      services. It may prove very difficult to bridge the gap between the hospital setting and&#xD;
      ongoing outpatient care resources. If this is not accomplished, a major goal of the provision&#xD;
      of inpatient VCT will be unmet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized trial compared the impact of free, routine, VCT during hospitalization for&#xD;
      acute illness at Mulago Hospital with referral for ambulatory VCT immediately following&#xD;
      hospital discharge (which was the current standard of care). We assessed HIV risk behavior&#xD;
      and linkage to care outcomes at 3 and 6 months. The following specific aims were addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the number of HIV infections newly identified by offering free VCT&#xD;
      routinely to hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine whether routine VCT in hospitalized patients increases partner disclosure&#xD;
      and reduces risk behavior at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine whether routine VCT in hospitalized patients increases linkage to&#xD;
      follow-up HIV care, including available opportunistic infection prophylaxis, antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment, hospice services, and other community-based social services.&#xD;
