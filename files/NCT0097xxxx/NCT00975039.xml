      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of Vascular Targeted Photodynamic therapy&#xD;
      with WST11 in patients with non-resectable or inoperable biliary carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective, multicentre, phase IIa study, evaluating a new&#xD;
      therapeutic agent in the management of patients suffering from inoperable or non resectable&#xD;
      biliary carcinoma. The patients will receive the dose of WST11 according to order of&#xD;
      inclusion. The first 3 patients will receive 2.5 mg/kg. In the absence of toxicity, the&#xD;
      following 9 patients will receive the dose of 5 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is to receive anesthesia. WST11-mediated therapy will consist of the combination&#xD;
      of single IV administration of WST11 at doses of 2.5mg/kg or 5mg/kg, using 753nm laser light&#xD;
      at a fixed power of (150mW/cm) and light energy (200 J/cm) delivered through a diffusing&#xD;
      fiber. The fiber is introduced in a transparent standard ERCP catheter and positioned under&#xD;
      radioscopy in front of the lesion.&#xD;

    <description>WST11-mediated VTP will consist of the combination of a single IV administration of WST11 at doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, using 753nm laser light at a fixed power (150 mW/cm) and light energy (200 J/cm). Illumination in the bile duct is performed by inserting a diffusing fiber, with cylindrical uniform light distribution, in a transparent standard ERCP catheter and by positioning, under radioscopy, the illumination tip of the diffusing fiber in front of the lesion.</description>
