  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and acceptability of an intermittent and daily PrEP&#xD;
      regimen using Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate plus Emtricitabine (FTC/TDF) in men and women at&#xD;
      risk for HIV, and it will directly compare adherence and intracellular drug levels in daily&#xD;
      and intermittent PrEP recipients. It will also evaluate the relationship between drug&#xD;
      adherence, sexual behavior and intracellular drug levels with an intermittent PrEP regimen.&#xD;
      In addition it will evaluate the relationship between adherence to an intermittent PrEP&#xD;
      regimen and timing of sexual activity in relation to PrEP dosing. The study will use&#xD;
      objective medication event monitoring medication event monitors (MEMS) adherence measurement&#xD;
      and evaluate the feasibility of newer adherence measurements such as hair sampling and plasma&#xD;
      drug levels. The study will also evaluate the feasibility of using SMS (text messages) to&#xD;
      collect sexual activity data in an African setting. It will allow study teams and communities&#xD;
      to prepare for potential subsequent larger trials of intermittent PrEP. This study is not&#xD;
      sized to evaluate efficacy. If the intermittent PrEP regimen is shown to be safe, feasible in&#xD;
      terms of adherence, and achieves intracellular drug levels similar to daily PrEP, these data&#xD;
      could be used to design a larger phase 2 study with one or more intermittent PrEP regimens.&#xD;
      The goal of such a trial would be to provide bridging data if daily PrEP regimens are found&#xD;
      to be effective or to prepare for efficacy or non-inferiority trials of intermittent versus&#xD;
      daily PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation of immune responses associated with FTC/TDF will also be evaluated in the pilot&#xD;
      study. The proportion of volunteers on FTC/TDF with HIV-specific immune responses, due to&#xD;
      exposures that did not lead to established HIV infection, will be assessed at 2-3 time points&#xD;
      and compared to responses in volunteers assigned to placebo. Immune responses may be&#xD;
      correlated with risk behavior and host factors, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type.&#xD;
      As noted above, very few HIV infections are expected to occur during the study, so&#xD;
      correlation of HIV-specific immune responses and protection from infection or attenuation of&#xD;
      disease progression will not be possible until a larger study is conducted.&#xD;
