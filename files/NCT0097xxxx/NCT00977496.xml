      The goal of this study is characterize the changes in bacterial diversity of the nares of&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients. Another goal is to determine when hemodialysis patients become&#xD;
      colonized with the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, as nasal colonization with S. aureus is a&#xD;
      major risk factor for invasive infection in hemodialysis patients. Fifteen subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited into the study. Nasal swabs will be collected every month for six months or until&#xD;
      one month after S. aureus colonization in order to determine any changes in the bacterial&#xD;
      communities of the nose. Clinical data will also be collected to evaluate the possible&#xD;
      influence of external factors on changes in the microbial communities in the patients' noses.&#xD;
      This study will provide preliminary data on whether oral- and/or nasal-administered&#xD;
      probiotics can eliminate nasal carriage of S. aureus.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects aged 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On a stable hemodialysis schedule three times a week at Tufts Medical Center&#xD;
             outpatient hemodialysis unit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to speak English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin (One of these languages is&#xD;
             spoken by &gt;95% of our hemodialysis population)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provides informed consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No plans to be absent from the dialysis unit in the next 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to report on adverse events during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in which hemodialysis was indicated for acute renal failure secondary to&#xD;
             septic shock, acute tubular necrosis, or other condition which is felt to be temporary&#xD;
             or secondary to a life threatening illness or likelihood of hemodialysis for less than&#xD;
             6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with systemic anti-staphylococcal antibiotic therapy within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment or planned use of topical mupirocin applied to the nares&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving peritoneal dialysis (concordance between the colonizing and infecting strain&#xD;
             is not as high as in the hemodialysis population (105))&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count less than 500/mm3 or anticipated fall in neutrophil count &lt;&#xD;
             500/mm3 (e.g. as a result of recent chemotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bleeding diathesis such as platelets count less than 20 or INR &gt;4 within the last 30&#xD;
             days&#xD;
