  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute abdominal pain and suspicion of appendicitis are common. The management&#xD;
      of these patients is controversial with large variations between hospitals. The clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis is regarded as insufficient necessitating the use of diagnostic techniques like&#xD;
      ultrasound, computerized tomography and diagnostic laparoscopy. However, the role of these&#xD;
      diagnostic techniques is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aim of this prospective interventional study is to analyze the impact of the&#xD;
      implementation of a clinical score to improve the clinical diagnosis and to serve as a basis&#xD;
      for a structured management of these patients by comparison of the results after the&#xD;
      implementation of the score with that of a baseline period. In the group of patients with&#xD;
      indeterminate diagnosis according to the clinical score, the value of diagnostic imaging will&#xD;
      be evaluated and compared with a period of in-hospital observation by randomization. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that a clinical score will decrease the use of unnecessary diagnostic imaging&#xD;
      and unnecessary admissions to hospital for observation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected appendicitis are common. Evidence based and efficient guidelines for&#xD;
      the management of these patients are lacking. Small changes in the management of these&#xD;
      patients may have important consequences for the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is difficult and in up to 25% of operations a non-inflamed appendix is found.&#xD;
      The management of patients with an equivocal diagnosis is controversial. Some advocate early&#xD;
      surgical exploration to avoid increased morbidity following perforation, with an associated&#xD;
      high frequency of negative explorations as an acceptable trade off. Others propose active&#xD;
      observation, which gives an improved diagnostic accuracy without increasing the number of&#xD;
      perforations. Early detection and treatment is more important in advanced appendicitis, which&#xD;
      is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality, whereas spontaneous resolution is a&#xD;
      possibility in phlegmonous appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management is based on the disease history, the clinical presentation and laboratory&#xD;
      examinations. We have shown that the inflammatory variables have higher discriminating&#xD;
      capacity than is previously thought, especially in advanced appendicitis. There are also new&#xD;
      inflammatory markers with unknown diagnostic value. The clinical diagnosis is a subjective&#xD;
      art, that can be made more objective by the use of a clinical scoring system. This suggests&#xD;
      that the clinical diagnosis can be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US) and Computerised Tomography (CT) have shown high&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity in prospective studies in specialised centres but the results in&#xD;
      everyday use are less encouraging. Some results suggests that unselective use of imaging will&#xD;
      lead to an increased number of appendectomies because of an increased detection of&#xD;
      appendicitis cases that would otherwise resolve untreated. This result is in line with&#xD;
      reports which have shown 3 to 5 times more cases of appendicitis among patients that were&#xD;
      randomised to early diagnostic laparoscopy compared to traditional management. The impact of&#xD;
      US on the diagnosis of appendicitis compared with traditional management has been evaluated&#xD;
      in only one randomised trial which found no benefit from US. For CT there are three&#xD;
      randomised small trials with conflicting results. These techniques are expensive, have&#xD;
      limited availability and suffer from other limitations like potentially harmful ionizing&#xD;
      radiation (CT) and examiner dependent efficacy (US). The exact role of imaging in the&#xD;
      management of patients with suspicion of appendicitis therefore still remains to be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical diagnosis involves a subjective synthesis of a large amount of complex&#xD;
      information, which relies on the surgeon's knowledge and previous experience of similar&#xD;
      cases. This process could be improved by using a clinical scoring system, which can&#xD;
      objectively determine the prognosis for the current patient from that of similar patients&#xD;
      from which the scoring was constructed. This can be used as a basis for a structured&#xD;
      algorithm for the management of the patients depending on the probability of appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous scoring systems, of which the &quot;Alvarado&quot; score is the most well known, have not&#xD;
      gained wide acceptance partly due to lack of performance in validation studies. Possible&#xD;
      reasons for this are weaknesses in the construction. A scoring system should ideally be&#xD;
      constructed from the diagnostic variables that have the strongest independent discriminating&#xD;
      capacity in a group of patients that is similar to that which it is intended to be applied&#xD;
      on, ie patients with a suspicion of appendicitis. Few scoring systems include inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, which have been shown to have high discriminating power. All previous scores loose&#xD;
      discriminating capacity because of dichotomisation of the variables. Many scoring systems&#xD;
      also fail to use an appropriate mathematical model for the construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most scoring systems have only defined one cut off point with a high sensitivity for&#xD;
      appendicitis but an insufficient specificity to decide on operation. A more realistic&#xD;
      approach is to define three diagnostic test zones, one with a high sensitivity for&#xD;
      appendicitis to identify the patients that can be safely discharged with an outpatient follow&#xD;
      up within 24 hours, another with a high specificity for appendicitis to identify patients&#xD;
      that can be operated without further examinations, and an indeterminate group of patients&#xD;
      which need additional diagnostic workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have constructed a clinical scoring system that includes mainly objective inflammatory&#xD;
      variables. In a validation study this score can correctly classify 63% of patients with&#xD;
      suspicion of appendicitis to groups with high and low suspicion of appendicitis with an&#xD;
      accuracy of 97%. This leaves 37% with an indeterminate result where the selected use of CT&#xD;
      could play a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of current study The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of the implementation of&#xD;
      a clinical score as a basis for the structured management of patients with suspected&#xD;
      appendicitis, especially for the selection of patients that may benefit from a CT&#xD;
      examination. The study is an interventional study with a Base-line period where the current&#xD;
      management of patients with suspicion of appendicitis is registered, and an&#xD;
      Intervention-period where the management is based on the results of the clinical scoring&#xD;
      system. In the Intervention phase of the study patients with an indeterminate scoring result&#xD;
      are randomised to diagnostic imaging or repeat examination after a period of observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients All patients with age 10 years and over and less than 5 days duration of symptoms&#xD;
      with suspicion of appendicitis at the emergency department are included in the study. In the&#xD;
      Baseline phase the actual management of the management of the patients are registered&#xD;
      (symptoms, laboratory values, admission to hospital, use of diagnostic imaging, surgical&#xD;
      interventions and complications). The management of these patients is not changed. During the&#xD;
      Intervention phase management is based on the results of the clinical score and the&#xD;
      associated proposed algorihtm. For the groups with high and low probability of appendicitis&#xD;
      the algorithm recommends surgical exploration or observation, respectively. Patients with a&#xD;
      low scoring and unaltered general condition and no suspicion of other serious disease are&#xD;
      recommended to be observed at home and followed up as outpatients within 24 hours. The&#xD;
      algorithm is only an advice and the surgeon has the liberty to manage the patient according&#xD;
      to his own choice or according to the local tradition, but he is asked to note the reasons&#xD;
      for breaches in the proposed algorithm. The outcomes of the implementation of this algorithm&#xD;
      is analysed by comparison with the results of a Baseline registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes to be evaluated are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The incidence of patients that were admitted for observation with a discharge diagnosis&#xD;
           of non-specific abdominal pain, compared with the Baseline phase. We expect that the&#xD;
           intervention will lead to fewer such admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The incidence of operations for phlegmonous and advanced appendicitis and negative&#xD;
           explorations, compared with the Baseline phase. We expect a decrease in both the&#xD;
           incidence of phlegmonous appendicitis and the negative explorations without an increase&#xD;
           in the incidence of perforations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The utilisation of CT, ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy in the groups with high and&#xD;
           low scoring, compared with the Baseline phase. We expect that the use of imaging should&#xD;
           decrease in these groups after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - Randomised trial Patients with an indeterminate scoring result are randomised to&#xD;
      repeat examination after in-hospital observation or diagnostic imaging. The patients that are&#xD;
      randomised to observation will be reassessed with the score after 6 hours of observation or&#xD;
      earlier if the patients condition is deteriorating. At this second assessment the surgeon is&#xD;
      free to decide on the management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following outcomes will be analysed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The number of patients that were operated for non-perforated appendicitis. This may be&#xD;
           higher in the imaging group as more patients with mild appendicitis that will resolve&#xD;
           without treatment may be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of negative appendectomies. This may be lower in the imaging group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The number of perforations. We do not expect any difference between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The delay from admittance to surgery. This may be shorter in the imaging group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The number of other diagnoses that need treatment. This may be higher in the imaging&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Costs during the hospital stay. The costs of imaging will be balanced by an earlier&#xD;
           discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation According to the validation of the score 37% of the admitted patients are&#xD;
      classified as indeterminate by the score. Of these 41% had appendicitis, 15% had negative&#xD;
      appendectomies and 44% were not operated. Diagnostic imaging may decrease the number of&#xD;
      negative appendectomies. A sample size of 686 randomised patients in each arm may detect a&#xD;
      decrease from 15% to 10% (alfa error 0.05, beta error 0.80).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues The proposed algorithm is close to the standard management of patients with&#xD;
      suspected appendicitis. As an effect of the intervention this management is formalised and&#xD;
      more evidence based than the current management. The algorithm is only an advice and the&#xD;
      surgeon is free to diverge from this advice according to his judgment and local traditions.&#xD;
      This means that the risk for adverse effects for the patient is small and is compensated for&#xD;
      by the positive effects. The study protocol has been approved by the regional ethical&#xD;
      committee (M15-09).&#xD;
