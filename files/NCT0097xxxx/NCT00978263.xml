      The investigators designed this prospective, randomized control study to compare the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety between the basal insulin glargine therapy and metformin-based OADs after&#xD;
      correction of the glucose toxicity with a short period of intensive insulin therapy.&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE-Type 2 diabetes is associated with defects in insulin secretion and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity. Hyperglycemia may aggravate these defects, a feature known as glucose toxicity.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that acute correction of hyperglycemia in subjects with&#xD;
      long-standing type 2 diabetes gives only short-term improvement in glycemic control after&#xD;
      discontinuation of insulin. The current study attempts to identify whether basal insulin&#xD;
      glargine or metformin-based OADs for further management would have a long-term benefit in&#xD;
      newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes after short-term intensive insulin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients (fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      &gt;200 mg/dL or random blood glucose &gt;300 mg/dL) will be hospitalized and treated with&#xD;
      intensive insulin injection for 10 to 14 days. HbA1c were measured before intensive insulin&#xD;
      injection. After discharge, patients will be randomized to receive basal insulin injection or&#xD;
      metformin-based OADs for further management. Patients will be followed in our clinics and&#xD;
      adjust their medication according to their blood glucose levels. HbA1c were measured 6 months&#xD;
      later.After the six-month intervention, these patients were continually followed up for&#xD;
      another six months. Subjects received an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after the&#xD;
      intensive insulin therapy and at the end of the 6th and 12th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS-We will expect that basal insulin glargine,compared with metformin-based OAD&#xD;
      treatment,could more effectively maintain adequate glycemic control in newly diagnosed type 2&#xD;
      diabetes after short-term intensive insulin therapy.&#xD;
