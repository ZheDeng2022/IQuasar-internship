  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Membranous nephropathy is associated with damage to the walls of the glomeruli, the&#xD;
           small blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste products from the blood. This&#xD;
           damage causes leakage of blood proteins into the urine and is associated with low blood&#xD;
           protein levels, high blood cholesterol values, and swelling of the legs. These problems&#xD;
           can decrease or go away without treatment in about 25 percent of patients, but if they&#xD;
           persist, some patients may experience impaired (or loss of) kidney function, blood&#xD;
           vessel and heart disease, and a risk of forming blood clots in veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney biopsies that show that antibodies have been deposited along the glomeruli&#xD;
           suggest that specialized cells of the immune system, called B and T cells, are causing&#xD;
           damage to the kidneys through their increased activity. To suppress the action of B and&#xD;
           T cells and to decrease the harmful deposits in the kidneys, drug treatments are&#xD;
           required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with membranous nephropathy are often treated with immunosuppressive drugs such&#xD;
           as cyclosporine or cytoxan plus steroids that attempt to reduce or suppress the activity&#xD;
           of the immune system, decrease antibody production, and reduce antibody deposits in the&#xD;
           kidney. However, not everyone responds to these medications and the kidney disease can&#xD;
           return in some patients when the drugs are stopped. Also, there are side effects&#xD;
           associated with long term usage of these medications. Rituximab, a different&#xD;
           immunosuppressant, has also been used for this purpose. Although cyclosporine and&#xD;
           Rituximab have been used separately, they have not been tried in combination as a&#xD;
           possible treatment for membranous nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of combining rituximab and cyclosporine to treat&#xD;
      membranous nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with membranous nephropathy&#xD;
      based on a kidney biopsy done within the preceding 24 months, and who have had excess levels&#xD;
      of protein in the urine for at least 6 months based on urine and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential participants will be screened with an initial clinic evaluation and full&#xD;
           medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the treatment, there will be a run-in period that will last up to 2 months.&#xD;
           During this time, participants will be placed on a blood pressure lowering medication&#xD;
           and will not take any other immunosuppressant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the NIH clinical center for a baseline evaluation, four&#xD;
           intravenous infusions of rituximab, and also at 1- to 6-month intervals throughout the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active treatment period will involve a 6-month course of cyclosporine and a total of&#xD;
           four doses of rituximab. Participants will take cyclosporine tablets twice daily, and&#xD;
           have two infusions of rituximab given 2 weeks apart, After 6 months, the cyclosporine&#xD;
           dose will slowly be decreased over several weeks and then completely discontinued.&#xD;
           Participants will then receive another course (two doses 2 weeks apart) of rituximab,&#xD;
           depending on results of blood work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have frequent blood and urine tests performed to monitor the results&#xD;
           of treatment and reduce the chance of side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot intervention study to evaluate preliminary evidence of the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of a novel combination immunosuppressive regimen, Rituximab plus cyclosporine,&#xD;
      in the treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Membranous nephropathy is a condition&#xD;
      that affects the kidney and involves damage to the walls of tiny blood vessels filters in the&#xD;
      kidneys called glomeruli. This damage allows blood proteins to leak into the urine&#xD;
      (proteinuria). As a result, patients have low protein levels in the blood, high blood&#xD;
      cholesterol levels and often develop leg swelling. This combination of symptoms and signs is&#xD;
      called the nephrotic syndrome. Some patients with membranous nephropathy develop impaired&#xD;
      kidney function and a proportion of these patients may develop kidney failure. The&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs that are most often used to treat membranous nephropathy include&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide plus steroids or cyclosporine. These vary in their effectiveness among&#xD;
      patients and there are side effects with each treatment. Rituximab alone has been used&#xD;
      experimentally to treat membranous nephropathy in small clinical trials. It has been&#xD;
      associated with decreased proteinuria of variable degrees in some patients. The purpose of&#xD;
      this pilot study is to evaluate whether the combination of Rituximab plus cyclosporine, two&#xD;
      drugs with different effects on the immune system, results in a greater number of remissions&#xD;
      of the nephrotic syndrome and more sustained remissions than is expected with cyclosporine&#xD;
      alone. Although each of these medications has been used separately in membranous nephropathy,&#xD;
      the potential benefits and risks of this combination have not yet been formally explored.&#xD;
      Patients age 18 years and older with idiopathic membranous nephropathy will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in this study. Pregnant and nursing women may not participate. Candidates must&#xD;
      have persistent nephrotic syndrome despite a 6 month observation period and treatment with&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker. Candidates will be&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, review of the&#xD;
      medical records and kidney biopsy results. Participants will come to NIH in Bethesda,&#xD;
      Maryland for evaluation and to receive intravenous infusions of Rituximab. Two doses of&#xD;
      Rituximab will be given (2 weeks apart). Participants will also take cyclosporine pills twice&#xD;
      a day. After 6 months, the dose of cyclosporine will be tapered over several weeks and then&#xD;
      discontinued. Patients will be re-treated with a second course of Rituximab (two infusions&#xD;
      given two weeks apart) after a minimum of 6 months has passed since completing the first&#xD;
      course of Rituximab. The exact timing of the second course of Rituximab will depend on the&#xD;
      results of blood tests. All patients will be followed for a minimum of 24 months from the&#xD;
      time that therapy is initiated.&#xD;

                  grams /24 hours (based on 24 hour urine collection).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Nephrotic range proteinuria (&gt;3.5 g/24 hours) that persists despite angiotensin&#xD;
                  antagonist therapy (ACE inhibitor or ARB) for at least 2 months unless&#xD;
                  intolerant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Renal biopsy within the past 24 months must reveal typical changes of membranous&#xD;
                  nephropathy by light and electron microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. There is no evidence to suggest secondary forms of membranous nephropathy.&#xD;
                  Diagnostic studies for the common causes of membranous nephropathy are listed&#xD;
                  under Baseline evaluation. Additional studies will be obtained as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &lt;18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Estimated GFR&lt;40 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (determined by the 4 variable version of the MDRD&#xD;
             Study prediction equation) while on ACEI/ARB therapy . Lab values from the preceding 2&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment will be used to assess eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Immunosuppressive medications or experimental medications of any type during the three&#xD;
             month period prior to initiating Rituximab and cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior exposure to cyclosporine or tacrolimus for more than 6 months and/or evidence of&#xD;
             intolerance or toxicity associated with cyclosporine treatment of any duration&#xD;
             including irreversible azotemia, liver dysfunction or hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior treatment with Rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinically significant medical conditions (i.e. severe heart failure NYHA class IV,&#xD;
             uncontrolled coronary artery disease/unstable angina), which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, could increase the subject s risk of participating in the study or could&#xD;
             confound the interpretation of the results of the study. Patients with a history of&#xD;
             arrhythmias will be evaluated by a cardiology consultant regarding recommendations as&#xD;
             Rituximab has been reported to exacerbate arrhythmias (in patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active acute or chronic infection requiring antimicrobial therapy or serious viral&#xD;
             infection (HIV, hepatitis B or C, herpes simplex, varicella zoster virus, parvovirus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Live viral vaccines within one month prior to Rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant women, nursing mothers or individuals (men or women) not practicing birth&#xD;
             control.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The rationale is that the safety of Rituximab during pregnancy, lactation, and infancy&#xD;
             has not been determined. However, limited data indicate that rituximab is present in&#xD;
             human milk and the effect on the breastfed child and no data on the effect on milk&#xD;
             production. IgG molecules are known to cross the placenta and Rituximab has been&#xD;
             detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero. Limited data indicate that B cell&#xD;
             lymphocytopenia lasting less than six months can occur in infants exposed to Rituximab&#xD;
             in utero. Pregnancy is not recommended until at least one year after Rituximab&#xD;
             administration. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with rituximab and&#xD;
             for 6 months after the last dose. In humans, cyclosporine crosses the placenta and&#xD;
             premature births and low birth weight are consistently observed. Cyclosporine enters&#xD;
             breast milk and may lead to immune suppression in the infant as well as the unknown&#xD;
             effects on growth or association with carcinogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as BP &gt;140/90 on &gt;25% of measurements. Blood&#xD;
             pressures will be measured 3 times at each clinic visit after the patient has sat&#xD;
             quietly for at least 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Cancer diagnosis or cancer recurrence within the preceding 5 years, excluding basal&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Clinical evidence of cirrhosis or chronic active liver disease sufficiently severe to&#xD;
             impair cyclosporine metabolism; this would include a prolonged prothrombin time.&#xD;
             Patients with abnormal liver function tests will be evaluated by the Hepatology&#xD;
             Consult Service to determine whether protocol participation is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Cytopenia (neutrophils &lt;1500/mm^3 and/or thrombocytopenia &lt;75,000) and/or CD4 T cell&#xD;
             count &lt;200/mm^3).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
