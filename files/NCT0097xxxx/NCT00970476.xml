  <brief_summary>

      To determine if arterial stiffness as measured by non-invasive pulse wave velocity can&#xD;
      predict the response to resynchronization therapy in heart failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients receiving CRT are medically refractory, symptomatic, NYHA class III or IV&#xD;
      disease and QRS duration of 130 m sec or greater, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of&#xD;
      30 percent or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulse wave velocity between carotid and femoral (PWVcf) will be recorded in each subject&#xD;
      at base line (before and after CRT), at one month (after AV delay optimization) and again at&#xD;
      6 months after CRT. The arterial pulse wave is recorded at a proximal artery, such as the&#xD;
      carotid artery, and as well as at a distal artery, such as the femoral artery. The&#xD;
      superficial location of the carotid and femoral arteries means that their pulse waveforms are&#xD;
      readily measured noninvasively using the M Hz Doppler probe, and between these two sites the&#xD;
      pulse wave has to travel through most of the aorta. The time delay between the arrival of a&#xD;
      predefined part of the pulse wave, such as the foot, at these 2 points is obtained by gating&#xD;
      to the peak of the R-wave of the ECG. The distance traveled by the pulse wave is measured&#xD;
      over the body surface and PWV is then calculated as distance/time (m/s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evidence of response: Either one or more of the following: 1) Improvement in NYHA&#xD;
      functional classification, 2) Improvement in 6 minute walking distance. 3) Change in&#xD;
      functional class, exercise tolerance while the heart is getting smaller on CXR. 4)&#xD;
      Stabilization of patient CHF even without subjective improvement over 6 months (remaining&#xD;
      class III rather than progressive to class IV). Imaging evidence of response: 1) Increase in&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction. 2) Reduction of mitral regurgitation. 3) Reduction of LV&#xD;
      volume signifying reverse remodeling.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients receiving CRT are medically refractory, symptomatic, NYHA class III or IV&#xD;
             disease and QRS duration of 130 m sec or greater, and a left ventricular ejection&#xD;
             fraction of 30 percent or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All individuals are carefully selected after appropriate clinical evaluation as&#xD;
             determined by the treating physicians to exclude possible reversible causes of heart&#xD;
             failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and non-palpable carotid and/or femoral&#xD;
             pulses will be excluded due to technical limitations of the procedure used for the&#xD;
             measurement of arterial stiffness.&#xD;
