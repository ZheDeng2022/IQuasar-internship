      Investigating the efficacy of maintenance and reinduction treatment or no treatment and&#xD;
      watchful waiting in subjects with inoperable or irresectable and non-progressive metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer after first line induction treatment for 24 weeks with a fluoropyrimidine-,&#xD;
      oxaliplatin- and bevacizumab-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maintenance treatment with capecitabine or 5-FU/folinic acid and bevacizumab will be&#xD;
      compared with a maintenance treatment with bevacizumab alone or no maintenance treatment.&#xD;
      Reinduction treatment will be done in case of progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy and bevacizumab represent a standard of care in treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Until now, continuation of chemotherapy - and bevacizumab - represents the&#xD;
      standard of care in colorectal cancer treatment. However, since the OPTIMOX1 trial showed an&#xD;
      equivalent duration of disease control for a de-escalation / maintenance / reintroduction&#xD;
      strategy compared with a treatment until progression strategy for oxaliplatin-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy, the question is whether this strategy might apply also to bevacizumab in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore, with the introduction of bevacizumab, there are&#xD;
      new options for a maintenance treatment which should be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the continuation of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab until disease progression has to be&#xD;
      regarded as standard of care, the question is whether a de-escalation of treatment intensity&#xD;
      or even withdrawal of treatment (&quot;drug holiday&quot;) after a certain treatment period will not be&#xD;
      inferior with respect to resulting time with tumor control, but allow patients a period with&#xD;
      less toxicity and gain of quality of life.&#xD;
