  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD,&#xD;
      commonly known as chronic bronchitis and emphysema). Despite this clear link, only 15-20% of&#xD;
      smokers develop COPD suggesting that genetic factors affect the lung's susceptibility to the&#xD;
      stress of cigarette smoke. The cells lining the airways (epithelium) and cells that help&#xD;
      defend the lung (alveolar macrophages) of smokers develop gene expression changes that are&#xD;
      different from that of nonsmokers. In the investigators' previous studies they have&#xD;
      demonstrated that there are greater than 200 genes that are responsive to cigarette smoke in&#xD;
      these cells. But the investigators do not know whether the gene expression is static or&#xD;
      changes as a function of time. Genes that show significant changes over time may be relevant&#xD;
      to the progression of the disease. Even though quitting smoking reduces the rate at which the&#xD;
      lungs decline, many-smokers still go on to develop COPD. This study will provide insights&#xD;
      into the natural history of smoking-related gene expression of the lung cells in health and&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      Cigarette smoke is responsible for the majority of lung cancers and is the major cause of&#xD;
      COPD, the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Despite the well established&#xD;
      causal role of cigarette smoking in lung cancer and COPD, only 10-20% of smokers actually&#xD;
      develop these diseases. This suggests that there are genetic predisposing factors that place&#xD;
      some individuals at greater risk. Our prior work shows that healthy smokers (cigarette&#xD;
      smokers with normal history, physical exam, lung function tests and chest x-rays) and smokers&#xD;
      with COPD have marked up and down regulation of greater than 200 genes in the small airway&#xD;
      epithelium and alveolar macrophages. There is however, a varied response to smoking among&#xD;
      individuals, with some individuals abnormally expressing far fewer genes. The focus of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the hypothesis that the response of the lung cells to the stress of&#xD;
      smoking is unique to each individual but is consistent over time. Furthermore, individuals&#xD;
      that stop smoking will each have a unique response, but is constant over time for each&#xD;
      individual. By defining the patterns of biologic response over time among smoking, ex-smoking&#xD;
      and nonsmoking subjects, we will be able to identify common biologic pathways as potential&#xD;
      targets for intervention.&#xD;

    <description>In individuals who quit but start smoking again despite the standard smoking cessation therapy, what are the effects on gene expression of returning to smoking. To assess whether baseline gene expression determines what genes rapidly change to a more &quot;normal&quot; expression pattern with smoking cessation. Does having established COPD determine the relative reversibility of the gene expression pattern with smoking cessation compared to healthy smokers.</description>
