  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) and liver transplantation, affects approximately 170 million individuals worldwide. The&#xD;
      prevention of HCV transmission and early intervention of HCV infection are urgently needed to&#xD;
      reduce or halt the liver-related morbidity and mortality. Double filtration plasmapheresis&#xD;
      (DFPP) has been with widespread use in clinical practice for several indications with plasma&#xD;
      filters optimized for the respective elimination targets with excellent safety. By way of the&#xD;
      plasma separator, the blood is separated into plasma and cell components. Separated plasma is&#xD;
      then led into the plasma component separator where the pores of the plasma component&#xD;
      separator further fractionate the plasma into large and small molecular components. The large&#xD;
      molecular components, including pathogenic substances, is removed and discarded and the small&#xD;
      molecular components, including proteins such as albumin and gamma-globulin, are returned to&#xD;
      the patient and mixed with the cell components. After the initiation of pegylated interferon&#xD;
      plus ribavirin (Peg-IFN+RBV) therapy, the rapid first phase relates to a significant&#xD;
      reduction in virus production and the degradation of free virus particles, which is followed&#xD;
      by a second much slower one reflecting the elimination and clearance of infected cells. In&#xD;
      HCV patients, high baseline viral load at the initiation of therapy is considered to be a&#xD;
      negative predictor for systemic vascular resistance (SVR) for HCV genotype 1 patients.&#xD;
      Reduction of baseline viral load by means of therapeutic double filtration plasmapheresis&#xD;
      (DFPP) may represent a plausible adjunct for improved antiviral therapy to reduce the virus&#xD;
      load with the initiation of treatment in synergy with Peg-IFN and RBV combination therapy.&#xD;
      Recently, several clinical studies in evaluating the therapeutic efficacy and safety of DFPP&#xD;
      in conjunction with IFN-based therapy were conducted for treatment-naïve genotype 1 high&#xD;
      viral load CHC patients, and CHC patients who underwent liver transplantation. These studies&#xD;
      showed that patients with DFPP treatment had more favorable HCV early viral kinetics to those&#xD;
      without DFPP treatment. Furthermore, all these studies showed excellent safety after DFPP&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore, the investigators aimed to conduct a large-scaled randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the overall response of DFPP for HCV genotype 1 patients with high viral&#xD;
      load.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) and liver transplantation, affects approximately 170 million individuals worldwide. The&#xD;
      prevention of HCV transmission and early intervention of HCV infection are urgently needed to&#xD;
      reduce or halt the liver-related morbidity and mortality. Currently, combination therapy with&#xD;
      peginterferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) has become the standard of care for chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C (CHC) patients, with an overall sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of&#xD;
      54-63%. Treatment with weekly Peg-IFN and weight-based RBV for 48 weeks resulted in a&#xD;
      significantly higher SVR rate than that for 24 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 1&#xD;
      infection. While HCV genotype 1 patients who had both rapid virologic response (RVR) and low&#xD;
      pretreatment viral load could receive short duration of therapy without compromising the&#xD;
      treatment responses, those who had either high baseline viral load or failed to achieve RVR&#xD;
      should receive at least 48 weeks of treatment. RVR is considered the most important factor&#xD;
      for SVR. Furthermore, several studies have repeated shown that high baseline viral load (&gt;&#xD;
      400,000~800,000 IU/mL) was closely associated with failure to achieve RVR in these patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, efforts to improve the RVR rate is important to facilitate the overall treatment&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP), a well established method of therapeutic apheresis,&#xD;
      has been with widespread use in clinical practice for several indications with plasma filters&#xD;
      optimized for the respective elimination targets. By way of the plasma separator, the blood&#xD;
      is separated into plasma and cell components. Separated plasma is then led into the plasma&#xD;
      component separator where the pores of the plasma component separator further fractionate the&#xD;
      plasma into large and small molecular components. The large molecular components, including&#xD;
      pathogenic substances, is removed and discarded and the small molecular components, including&#xD;
      proteins such as albumin and gamma-globulin, are returned to the patient and mixed with the&#xD;
      cell components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DFPP has been used in the treatment of many diseases such as neurological diseases, collagen&#xD;
      diseases, hematological diseases, skin diseases, and renal diseases, and its efficacy and&#xD;
      safety have been well established. It is noteworthy to mention that DFPP has been indicated&#xD;
      to treat CHC in Japan since April 2008. In Germany, the safety of DFPP in LDL-apheresis was&#xD;
      analyzed within a retrospective multicenter investigation including data from 1702 ambulatory&#xD;
      DFPP-LDL-apheresis treatments of 52 patients (REMUKAST Study). Ninety-eight percent of the&#xD;
      treatments bear no serious adverse events while only 2% of slight hypotensive episodes were&#xD;
      observed. In a recent investigation, efficacy and safety of DFPP was compared with the HELP&#xD;
      (Heparin-induced Extracorporeal LDL-Cholesterol Precipitation) system in a cross-over design.&#xD;
      No serious adverse events occurred in this study including 44 treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During chronic infection, the level of serum HCV RNA is in a steady state with only minor&#xD;
      fluctuations in untreated patients. A dynamic equilibrium, involving hepatocytes and plasma&#xD;
      components, exists between new viral production and viral destruction during chronic HCV&#xD;
      infection. After the initiation of Peg-IFN plus RBV therapy, the viral decline can be divided&#xD;
      into two major phases. Over the first 24 - 48 h the initial dose of PEG-IFN/RBV leads to a&#xD;
      first decline of HCV RNA which ranges from 0.5-2.0 log levels. This rapid first phase relates&#xD;
      to a significant reduction in virus production and the degradation of free virus particles,&#xD;
      which is followed by a second much slower one reflecting the elimination and clearance of&#xD;
      infected cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described above, a high baseline viral load (HCV-RNA &gt; 800,000 IU/mL) at the initiation of&#xD;
      therapy is considered to be a negative predictor for SVR for HCV genotype 1 patients.&#xD;
      Reduction of baseline viral load by means of therapeutic DFPP may represent a plausible&#xD;
      adjunct for improved antiviral therapy to reduce the virus load with the initiation of&#xD;
      treatment in synergy with Peg-IFN and RBV combination therapy. Therefore the rationale for&#xD;
      the effect of DFPP is that the reduced amount of virus during the initiation phase supports&#xD;
      the therapeutic efficacy of Peg-IFN and RBV combination therapy by preventing liver&#xD;
      reinfection by circulating HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several small-scaled clinical studies in evaluating the therapeutic efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of DFPP in conjunction with IFN-based therapy were conducted for treatment-naïve&#xD;
      genotyp1 high viral load CHC patients, and CHC patients who underwent liver transplantation.&#xD;
      These studies showed that patients with DFPP treatment had more favorable HCV early viral&#xD;
      kinetics to those without DFPP treatment. The large-scaled non-randomized clinical study&#xD;
      totally evaluating 104 CHC patients showed that the addition of DFPP had a higher SVR rate to&#xD;
      those without DFPP treatment in HCV genotype 1 patients with baseline viral load &gt; 100,000&#xD;
      IU/mL (70.8% versus 50.0%), probably due to eliminating a substantial part of viral particles&#xD;
      from the dynamic equilibrium of the liver and plasma compartments. Furthermore, all these&#xD;
      studies showed excellent safety after DFPP treatment. However, these studies were limited by&#xD;
      the small case numbers and non-randomized assignment, making the role of DFPP in improving&#xD;
      the efficacy of difficult-to-treat HCV patients still debated. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      aimed to conduct a large-scaled randomized controlled trial to evaluate the overall response&#xD;
      of DFPP for HCV genotype 1 patients with high viral load.&#xD;
