        <title>Plasma Concentration Versus Time Summary of Single Dose of OAP-189</title>
        <description>Concentration versus time summary was calculated by setting concentration values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ = 0.500 nanogram per millliter) to zero. Summary statistics were not to be presented if number of observations above lower limit of quantification (NALQ) =0.</description>
