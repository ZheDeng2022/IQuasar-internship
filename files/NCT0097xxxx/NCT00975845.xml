  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the outcome of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction performed using the&#xD;
      tibialis allograft to historical outcomes of ACL reconstruction patients and to establish if&#xD;
      any correlation exists between the age of the graft donor and the clinical outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single site, pilot study in patients with a ruptured ACL. A total of&#xD;
      fifty (50) subjects will be enrolled in this trial. All patients will have been scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo ACL reconstruction and will receive a BioCleanse Tibialis allograft as part of the&#xD;
      normal standard of care practiced by the treating surgeon. Follow up is for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no assignment of graft, specific to donor age, to the patients. All&#xD;
      treatment will follow standard of care and this study assumes that there will be a normal&#xD;
      distribution of graft donor ages, from 18 to 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient outcomes will be compared between the 2 groups of tendon donor ages. Neither the&#xD;
      surgeon nor the patient will be aware of the age of the graft donor, per typical standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

    <description>The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) is a knee-specific patient-reported outcome measure. This is an indexed score form 0-100, with 0 being the worst possible status and 100 indicating no dysfunction, disability or pain.</description>

    <description>The SF36 measures the quality life as reported by the paritricpantm, and is an indexed score form 0 - 100. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability</description>
