      The purpose of this study is to determine if GSK706769 can maintain clinical remission&#xD;
      established by Enbrel after withdrawal of Enbrel in rheumatoid arthritis patients.&#xD;

      This study is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study&#xD;
      in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on stable doses of Enbrel. Subjects with an&#xD;
      adequate response to Enbrel will be enrolled into the study. Subjects will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      their Enbrel and randomized to receive 28 days of dosing with either GSK706769 or placebo&#xD;
      followed by 28 days off-drug. This study is exploring a novel therapeutic paradigm for RA,&#xD;
      remission maintenance. In such an approach, remission is induced and then the inducing agent&#xD;
      is stopped and a maintenance agent is added. The clinical benefit would be derived from the&#xD;
      fact that the remission agent may be easier to take (e.g. oral rather than parenteral), more&#xD;
      durable in its maintenance of remission, and/or safer (e.g. no TB reactivation). This study&#xD;
      directly explores remission maintenance. Specifically, in a randomised, double blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled study, RA patients in remission through an adequate response to Enbrel will be&#xD;
      recruited. Enbrel has been selected as it has a relatively short half life and therefore it&#xD;
      is more likely patients treated with placebo may have a higher incidence of relapse after 28&#xD;
      days than with other anti-TNF treatments. After withdrawal of Enbrel (and possibly other oral&#xD;
      DMARDs), subjects will be randomised to receive GSK706769 or placebo for 28 days followed by&#xD;
      a period of 28 days off treatment. It is hypothesized that GSK706769 will prevent any CCR5+&#xD;
      cells from returning into the synovium, thereby resulting in maintenance of the efficacy&#xD;
      induced by Enbrel. In the placebo group, CCR5 cells may re-populate the synovium resulting in&#xD;
      increased inflammation. Patients experiencing increased disease activity will be able to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study and resume standard of care.&#xD;
