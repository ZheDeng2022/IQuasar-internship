  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done with a new therapy called &quot;Selective Internal Radiation Therapy&quot;&#xD;
      (known as SIRT). Radiation is an effective treatment for destroying tumors. It is widely used&#xD;
      in cancer treatment. However, radiation can harm normal tissue. SIR-Spheres are tiny plastic&#xD;
      beads. They contain a radioactive agent called Yttrium-90. These beads can be delivered&#xD;
      through a small tube inserted into the blood vessel that goes directly to the tumor. The&#xD;
      radiation goes directly to the tumor. This spares healthy parts of your liver.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female patients must either be postmenopausal, sterile (surgically or radiation- or&#xD;
             chemically-induced), or if sexually active, must agree to use an acceptable method of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients must be surgically sterile, or if sexually active, must agree to use an&#xD;
             acceptable method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months without any active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No chemotherapy regimen administration for at least 4 weeks prior to SIRT&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of severe cirrhosis (CHILDS B and C), portal hypertension with&#xD;
             gastroesophageal varices and liver failure as determined by clinical, radiologic or&#xD;
             laboratory assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiotherapy delivered to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;

             are therefore exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With a Tc-99m macroaggregated albumin (MAA) hepatic arterial perfusion&#xD;
                  scintigraphy that shows any disposition to the gastrointestinal tract that cannot&#xD;
                  be corrected by angiographic and embolization techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With more than 20% shunting of blood to the lungs as estimated in the Lung&#xD;
                  Scintigram performed after the intraarterial injection of Tc MAA. Radiation&#xD;
                  pneumonitis has been seen in patients receiving doses of Yttrium-90 greater than&#xD;
                  30 Gy in a single treatment. This corresponds to the shunt over 20% presence of&#xD;
                  vascular abnormalities, bleeding diathesis, making catheterization of the hepatic&#xD;
                  artery contraindication.&#xD;
