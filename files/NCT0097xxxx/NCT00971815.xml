  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic stress has been proposed to be involved the development of western life-style&#xD;
      diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). At the same time chronic&#xD;
      stress is also believed to cause psychiatric disease such as melancholic depression (MD)and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, humans born with low birth weight (LBW) (ei. less than 5,0 LB) display an&#xD;
      increased risk for T2DM and MD. Studies suggest stress and adrenal stress hormones&#xD;
      (glucocorticoids) (GCC) might be involved in the development of both of these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies of animals born LBW suggest, that SSRI-compounds, usually employed in the&#xD;
      treatment of MD-related diseases, reduces stress-responses and levels of stress hormones such&#xD;
      adrenal steroids and at the same time has a positive influence on glucose metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In present study, the investigators aim to measure levels of GCC and stress and assess&#xD;
      glucose metabolism in healthy young men (20-35 years) born LBW (40 subjects). The volume and&#xD;
      structure of a certain brain area (ie. hippocampus) involved in regulation of adrenal GCC and&#xD;
      known to be malfunctioning in chronically stressed individuals will be assessed by magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI). Further metabolic examination will be accompanied by MRI&#xD;
      spectroscopy of liver and muscle fat content as well as total fat content (Dexa-scanning) and&#xD;
      contents of fat in the abdomen (by MRI) . Psychiatric well-ness and symptoms will be&#xD;
      characterized by well-established questionnaires such as MDI and SCL-92 and responses as&#xD;
      regards blood pressure, heart rate and changes in basal plasma concentrations of GCC and&#xD;
      Epinephrine will be assessed while performing a Stroop Stress Test. Finally, a 24 hour blood&#xD;
      pressure profile test will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this extensive examination program, subjects will be randomized to 3-4 months of&#xD;
      treatment with either Escitalopram (an SSRI-compound) or Placebo. Subsequently, at the end of&#xD;
      the treatment, the whole examination program will be repeated to detect potential beneficial&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of young normal birth weight men (20 subjects) will serve as a healthy baseline group&#xD;
      for comparison and will not be exposed to any medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will add understanding to the mechanism underlying the development of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and depression in LBW. Additionally, present trial might be capable of proposing a&#xD;
      novel treatment strategy to prevent the development of these diseases in LBW man.&#xD;
