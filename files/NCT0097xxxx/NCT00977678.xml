  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The capacity for endoscopical procedures in the Norwegian health system is low in comparison&#xD;
      to demands from patients and family practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies aim is to evaluate the acceptance of a new concept: an open access gastroscopy&#xD;
      clinic where patients can attend without a preceding appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient´s satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General practitioner´s satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Acceptance by the staff of the clinic.&#xD;

      The fact that access to specialized norwegian health care is characterized by a mismatch&#xD;
      between system´s capacity and patient´s and refering physician´s demands, leads to delay of&#xD;
      diagnostic investigations such as for example gastroscopies. Patients referred to&#xD;
      gastroscopies have to wait 4 to 12 weeks to get an appointment. Consequence might be a delay&#xD;
      in diagnosing of significant diseases such as ulcers or even malignancies. In addition the&#xD;
      general practitioner is frequently forced to start a therapy by suspicion, and the patient&#xD;
      has in numerable cases to stay off work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In September 2008, the investigators started an open-access gastroscopy outpatient clinic,&#xD;
      which allows the family practitioners in a defined area of the Telemark county to refer their&#xD;
      patients to a gastroscopy without a preceding appointment. Patients from the other parts of&#xD;
      the county and those, who need special service as i.e. interpreter, endocarditis prophylaxis&#xD;
      etc. are referred conventionally and need an appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the acceptance of both forms of outpatient clinics by both&#xD;
      patients and general practitioners. In addition to that, the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      acceptance of the open access clinic by the staff. Of special concern is the fear, that&#xD;
      easier access might lead to a number of unnecessary procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients from open access clinic and from the conventional clinic are asked to fill in a&#xD;
      questionaire without any kind of personal identifying data such as name, age, date of the&#xD;
      procedure etc., but with questions about their satisfaction with the procedure, the time from&#xD;
      their first contact with their family practitioner to the procedure, the information prior&#xD;
      and after the procedure. They will be asked if they did consume drugs against &quot;ulcer-disease&quot;&#xD;
      or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the referring practitioners are asked to fill in a questionnaire about their&#xD;
      acceptance of the open access clinic, and to give the investigators some ideas about&#xD;
      advantages and disadvantages from their point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The staff is asked to give their experience especially according to the not calculable number&#xD;
      of patients that attend to the clinic each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the present study shows high acceptance of the open-access-offer by patients and health&#xD;
      workers, the plan is to extend it to other patient groups and to perform studies to&#xD;
      investigate the effects on the grade of diseases at the time of diagnosis and possible&#xD;
      consequences for treatment and health economy.&#xD;
