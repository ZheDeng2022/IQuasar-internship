      This prospective clinical randomized controlled trial is established to compare the clinical,&#xD;
      radiographic, and histological treatment outcomes between MTA and FC in pulpotomized human&#xD;
      primary molars at 6, 12, 18, 24 month post-treatment and to test the hypothesis that Gray&#xD;
      Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (GMTA) is a viable alternative to Diluted (20%) Formocresol (DFC)&#xD;
      in pulpotomies treatment of human primary molars.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Background: Formocresol (FC) is the most widely used pulpotomy medicament in the primary&#xD;
           dentition. There are concerns associated with this medicament, primarily the&#xD;
           carcinogenicity of the chemical and internal resorption of the treated tooth. Recently,&#xD;
           Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) has been suggested with preliminary studies showing&#xD;
           promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design: This is a prospective clinical randomized controlled trial (RCT), which&#xD;
           will be performed at Department of Dentistry, National Taiwan University Hospital, to&#xD;
           compare the treatment outcomes between MTA and FC in pulpotomized human primary molars&#xD;
           and to evaluate whether GMTA is a viable alternative to DFC in pulpotomies treatment of&#xD;
           human primary molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Null Hypotheses: there is no clinical, radiographic, or histological difference&#xD;
                between GMTA and DFC at 6, 12, 18, 24 month post-treatment when used as a pulp&#xD;
                dressing agent in pulpotomized primary molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Alternative Hypotheses: There is a statistically significant difference between&#xD;
                GMTA and DFC as a pulpotomy agent. GMTA shows clinical and/or radiographic and/or&#xD;
                histological success as a dressing material following pulpotomy in primary human&#xD;
                molars and may be a suitable replacement for DFC in primary molar pulpotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The primary aims of this investigation are:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Compare the clinical and radiographic results of GMTA with DFC pulpotomies on&#xD;
                     vital human primary molars at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Assess intraradicular histological changes of the pulpal tissue and root&#xD;
                     dentin following pulpotomy treatment with GMTA or DFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The secondary aims of this investigation are:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Assess the outcome of GMTA by multiple operators that have been calibrated to&#xD;
                     the methods of mixing and placing the material.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Assess whether sex, tooth type, arch, and age of patient at time of treatment&#xD;
                     influence the overall success rate of GMTA pulpotomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Compare the radiographic success of the two materials based on both the&#xD;
                     traditional radiographic assessment criteria adopted by the American Academy&#xD;
                     of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) and the alternative radiographic success&#xD;
                     criteria adopted by Zurn et al. 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. To serve as a basis for future research in the comparison of GMTA and DFC&#xD;
                     pulpotomies. This will include larger sample size, longer follow-up periods,&#xD;
                     and a collaborative study with UM group (Prof. Jan C. Hu).&#xD;
