      This pharmacokinetic clinical trial is a dose ranging study of lidocaine in tumescent local&#xD;
      anesthesia. The goal is to understand the absorption pharmacokinetic of tumescent lidocaine&#xD;
      and to determine an objective (statistical) estimate of the maximum safe mg/kg dosage of&#xD;
      lidocaine in tumescent local anesthesia without liposuction.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) permits a wide variety of therapeutic surgical procedures of&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissues and skin to be performed totally by local anesthesia ( ). Infiltration&#xD;
      of a sufficient volume of TLA causes the target tissues become temporarily tumescent, or&#xD;
      swollen and firm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TLA is defined as the subcutaneous infiltration of a large volume of a tumescent local&#xD;
      anesthetic solution (TLAS). The safe use of TLA requires the safe formulation and safe use of&#xD;
      a tumescent local anesthetic solution (TLAS). By definition TLAS contains very dilute&#xD;
      lidocaine (≤ 1 gm/liter = 0.1%) and epinephrine (≤ 1 mg/liter = 1:1,000,000) with sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate (10 milliequivalents/liter) in a physiologic crystalloid solution. Bicarbonate,&#xD;
      an essential ingredient, neutralizes the acid pH of commercial lidocaine and epinephrine&#xD;
      thereby eliminating the intense stinging discomfort which often associated with the&#xD;
      infiltration of commercial local anesthetics. Lidocaine which has been infiltrated for TLA is&#xD;
      referred to as tumescent lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA-approved maximum recommended dosage is 7 mg/kg for lidocaine with epinephrine&#xD;
      infiltration local anesthesia. However with TLA much larger mg/kg dosages of lidocaine are&#xD;
      used. The safety and efficacy of TLA is based on the unexpected slow lidocaine absorption&#xD;
      associated with large volumes of very dilute lidocaine and epinephrine when infiltrated into&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue. Published estimates of a maximum safe mg/kg dosage of tumescent&#xD;
      lidocaine are derived from liposuction patients and have ranged from 35 mg/kg to 55 mg/kg ( )&#xD;
      and much higher lidocaine doses without evident toxicity have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposuction, a cosmetic surgical procedure which removes subcutaneous fat, also removes some&#xD;
      tumescent lidocaine thereby reducing lidocaine bioavailability. In contrast, therapeutic&#xD;
      surgeries usually do not remove subcutaneous lidocaine and therefore the bioavailability of&#xD;
      lidocaine is relatively increased as is the peak serum lidocaine concentration (Cmax) and the&#xD;
      risk of lidocaine toxicity. Because TLA is now used for surgical procedures unrelated to&#xD;
      liposuction, it is desirable to have a reliable estimate of the maximum safe dosage of&#xD;
      tumescent lidocaine based on clinical data from subjects not having liposuction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the present study is to obtain reliable estimates of the maximum safe mg/kg&#xD;
      dosage of lidocaine after tumescent local anesthesia both with and without subsequent&#xD;
      liposuction. The plan for the present pharmacokinetic study involves the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Show that there is a significant difference between the bioavailability of tumescent&#xD;
           lidocaine with or without liposuction. This will validate the need to determine the&#xD;
           maximum safe mg/kg dosage of tumescent lidocaine without liposuction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Show that the magnitude of the peak serum lidocaine concentration is a linear function&#xD;
           of the mg/kg dosage of tumescent lidocaine, with and without liposuction. This will&#xD;
           support the use of interpolation and extrapolation in the discussion of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For any specified mg/kg dosage of tumescent lidocaine, estimate the risk that the peak&#xD;
           serum lidocaine concentration will exceed the 6 µg/ml toxic threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol and consent forms for this research has been approved by an institutional review&#xD;
      board. All clinical procedures are to be conducted within an accredited ambulatory surgery&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum lidocaine concentration will be measured by high pressure flame chromatography (HPFC).&#xD;
      Female volunteer subjects will each participate in three procedures. Each procedure involves&#xD;
      the infiltrating of TLA followed by sequential serum samples obtained from a peripheral vein&#xD;
      via plastic catheter at time (T) = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 24 hours to be&#xD;
      assayed for lidocaine concentration by HPFC. For each procedure, the mg/kg dosage of&#xD;
      tumescent lidocaine and a corresponding peak or maximum serum lidocaine concentration (Cmax)&#xD;
      are to be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The areas targeted for infiltration of tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) will vary from&#xD;
      subject to subject and include abdomen, hips, outer thigh, inner thighs and knees, female&#xD;
      breasts, lateral thorax and back. For each subject, the first two investigative procedures&#xD;
      involve an infiltration of TLA without subsequent liposuction; in the third procedure the&#xD;
      subject receive TLA followed by liposuction. Thus each patient serves as her own control.&#xD;
      Liposuction will be initiated one to two hour after completion of the infiltration process.&#xD;
      For each subject the TLA infiltration will be in the same area and sequential infiltrations&#xD;
      are to be separated by at least two weeks. As compensation for participation in the three&#xD;
      clinical studies, each procedure requiring more than 24 hours, the patients will receive&#xD;
      liposuction of the targeted area at no cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total mg/kg dosage of tumescent lidocaine will vary between patients and for different&#xD;
      procedures within the same patient. An individual patient will receive the same mg/kg dosage&#xD;
      of tumescent lidocaine on at least two occasions, once followed by liposuction and at least&#xD;
      once without liposuction. Some patients will receive the same dosage of tumescent lidocaine&#xD;
      for all three procedures. Similarly, in order to explore the effect of varying the&#xD;
      concentrations lidocaine or the concentration of epinephrine within the TLA solution or to&#xD;
      understand the effect of varying the mg/kg dosage of TLA, in some patients these factors will&#xD;
      be varied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine if liposuction significantly affects the amount of lidocaine that&#xD;
      enters the systemic circulation, the bioavailability associated of tumescent lidocaine&#xD;
      without and with liposuction will be compared. The statistical significance of the difference&#xD;
      between the area under the curve (AUC) without liposuction and the AUC with liposuction will&#xD;
      be calculated For each procedure, a graph of the sequential serum lidocaine concentrations&#xD;
      C(T) as a function of time (T) will be drawn and each peak serum lidocaine concentration and&#xD;
      time will be recorded both with liposuction and without liposuction. Confidence intervals&#xD;
      will be determined in order to estimate the risk that, for any given mg/kg dosage, the Cmax&#xD;
      will exceed the toxic threshold for lidocaine.&#xD;
