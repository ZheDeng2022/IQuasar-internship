      Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)-based radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of&#xD;
      radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue. Investigators initiated a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of&#xD;
      short course preoperative chemoradiotherapy utilizing Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy&#xD;
      (IMRT) in combination with capecitabine in patients with resectable rectal carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative chemoradiotherapy has become a standard part of treatment protocols in stage II&#xD;
      and III rectal cancer. Compared to postoperative chemoradiotherapy, the advantage of&#xD;
      preoperative application of chemotherapeutics and irradiation includes improved compliance,&#xD;
      reduced toxicity, and downstaging of the tumor in a substantial number of patients. The&#xD;
      latter may enhance the rate of curative surgery, permit sphincter preservation in patients&#xD;
      with low-sited tumors, and have a positive impact on the quality of life of these patients&#xD;
      (Sauer et al, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most widely used chemotherapeutic agent in colorectal cancer has been 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      (5-FU), and numerous attempts have been made to improve its efficacy, including biomodulation&#xD;
      and protracted infusion. It has been demonstrated that biomodulation with leucovorin or&#xD;
      levamisole was not effective in rectal cancer (Tepper et al, 2002), and protracted infusion&#xD;
      of 5-FU was superior to bolus injection (O'Connell et al, 1994). New oral chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents including capecitabine have been introduced and tried in colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Capecitabine is a tumor-selective fluoropyrimidine carbamate designed to achieve a higher&#xD;
      intratumoral 5-FU level with lower systemic toxicity than intravenous administration of 5-FU&#xD;
      (Shimma et al, 2000). It passes intact through the intestinal mucosa and is converted to&#xD;
      5-FU, preferentially in tumor tissue by thymidine phosphorylase (Schuller et al, 2000 ;&#xD;
      Ishikawa et al, 1998 ; Miwa et al, 1998). Theoretically, oral capecitabine mimics the effect&#xD;
      of protracted infusion of 5-FU without complications accompanying intravenous delivery (Liu&#xD;
      et al, 1997). Moreover, experimental data using human cancer xenografts demonstrated&#xD;
      up-regulation of thymidine phosphorylase by radiation (Sawada et al, 1999), constituting a&#xD;
      synergistic effect. In two randomized Phase III trials, capecitabine showed a superior&#xD;
      overall response rate and safety profile compared with 5-FU/lecovorinin for metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (Van Cutsem et al, 2001; Hoff et al, 2001; Twelves, 2002). Intensity&#xD;
      modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)-based radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation&#xD;
      directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;
      (Ballonoff et al, 2008)&#xD;
&#xD;
      With such encouraging outcomes, investigators initiated a prospective study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and toxicity of short course preoperative chemoradiotherapy utilizing Intensity&#xD;
      Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) in combination with capecitabine in patients with&#xD;
      resectable rectal carcinoma.&#xD;
