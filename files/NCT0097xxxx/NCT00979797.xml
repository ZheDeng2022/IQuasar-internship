  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed four-year randomized study will attempt to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      community-based child health interventions in conjunction with facility-based IMCI will&#xD;
      improve child care practices, nutritional status and child survival. The objectives of this&#xD;
      research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the effectiveness of the community-based interventions in improving selected&#xD;
           child care practices in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the effectiveness of the community-based interventions in improving child&#xD;
           nutritional status and in reducing child morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To document the process of implementation of community-based interventions at scale to&#xD;
           promote selected key family and community practices related to child health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To undertake cost-effectiveness analysis of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) is a strategy developed by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) and UNICEF to reduce childhood mortality and morbidity and to contribute&#xD;
      to improved growth and development of children under-5 years of age Experience suggests that&#xD;
      a purely facility based strategy will not reach the significant portion of the population&#xD;
      that does not have access to or choose not to use a health facility. Links between the&#xD;
      service providers and families at household levels is essential in order to ensure that&#xD;
      families have the knowledge, skills and ability to provide appropriate preventative and&#xD;
      curative care to their children. However, globally, actual evidence of effectiveness of&#xD;
      community-based IMCI interventions implemented at scale is meager.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-IMCI in Bangladesh will be implemented by GoB in partnership with NGOs and also through&#xD;
      active participation of different community groups, civil societies, and the private sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both GoB and UNICEF/Bangladesh have agreed that an evaluation of the C-IMCI implementation by&#xD;
      GoB, as proposed here, would be very opportune and useful in providing the evidence and&#xD;
      analysis of lessons that will guide further scale-up in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cluster-randomized design will be used for this evaluation. Fourteen Upazilas where&#xD;
      facility-based IMCI is already in place will be selected, and 7 upazillas will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to C-IMCI intervention and 7 to comparison. Community-based IMCI in the&#xD;
      intervention upazillas will be implemented by GoB through the district health system while in&#xD;
      the comparison upazillas existing services will continue, including facility-based IMCI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overall study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the proposed cluster randomized community-based intervention trial, upazilas&#xD;
      (Sub-districts) will be randomized to either intervention or comparison. The upazila is the&#xD;
      lowest local government structure with a health management unit. The usual upazila has a&#xD;
      population of about 200,000 to 250,000. Fourteen upazilas where facility-based IMCI is&#xD;
      already in place will be selected for the study, and 7 upazilas will be randomized to&#xD;
      intervention and 7 to comparison. The objective of the randomization is to achieve a balance&#xD;
      on the basis of facility IMCI interventions, functionality of health system, demographic and&#xD;
      socioeconomic indicators, and population size. Community-based IMCI in the intervention&#xD;
      upazilas will be implemented through the district health system while in the comparison&#xD;
      upazilas existing services will continue, including facility-based IMCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Upazilas and randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The upazilas for the study will be selected based on the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facility based IMCI has been implemented in 300 upazilas as of December 2008. Most of these&#xD;
      upazilas were selected from parts of Bangladesh with high rates of under-five mortality. In&#xD;
      addition, the IMCI expansion plan of the Government of Bangladesh emphasizes achieving&#xD;
      complete coverage of a district and selecting upazilas where other implementing partners are&#xD;
      present so as to facilitate eventual expansion of community IMCI interventions. Out of 300&#xD;
      upazilas, 100 were excluded where facility IMCI is in very early stage. Within remaining 200&#xD;
      upazilas, Government has decided to implement community IMCI in all upazials of 14 districts&#xD;
      and began the implementation in 5 districts in 2008 and early 2009. Seven pairs of upazilas&#xD;
      will be selected form the upzilas of these 6 districts for evaluation. We are using district&#xD;
      mortality rate as upazila under-five mortality rates are not available. We assume that that&#xD;
      the variation of the true upazila under-five mortality rates is similar to that of district&#xD;
      rates. We also exclude upazilas with or adjoining municipal areas as these are atypical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Pairing and re-randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourteen upazilas will be paired based on demographic and socio-economic indicators:&#xD;
      population density, literacy rate (total &amp; female), male and female school attendance, and&#xD;
      work status, source of drinking water, sanitary toilet, electricity, and flow of remittance.&#xD;
      . A composite score using Principal Component Analysis will be constructed from these&#xD;
      demographic and socio-economic indicators. This score will be used to sort upazilas within a&#xD;
      district. In addition geographical location (proximity, within same district), population&#xD;
      size, and health system functionality) assessed using immunization coverage) will also be&#xD;
      considered in pairing of upazilas within a district. The National Nutrition Program (NNP) is&#xD;
      the largest nutrition programme being implemented by GoB. Whether or not NNP is covering a&#xD;
      particular upazila or is planning to is an important piece of information for this study as&#xD;
      NNP was designed to reduce the prevalence of moderate and severe underweight in young&#xD;
      children, address micronutrient deficiencies, increase pregnancy weight gain, reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of low birth weight, and the prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia among adolescent&#xD;
      girls and pregnant women. Ongoing or planned implementation of NNP or the presence of any&#xD;
      other substantive and similar community-based programmes will also be considered before&#xD;
      selecting a upazila. Seven (07) pairs of upazilas will be formed and one upazila from each of&#xD;
      the 7 pairs would be randomly assigned to C-IMCI intervention arm and the other to&#xD;
      comparison. We have increased the number of pairs for the evaluation study from six to seven&#xD;
      based on discussions with GoB, UNICEF, and WHO. The additional pair was from Bandarban&#xD;
      district which was selected at the request of the MNCS programme (GoB/UNICEF). Bandarban&#xD;
      district is in the hilly South-Eastern region of Bangladesh and is home to ethnically&#xD;
      distinct populations and GoB/UNICEF is keen on including the district in the evaluation as&#xD;
      programme experiences in these populations are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation and monitoring of implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation and monitoring is essential to achieve the proposal's third aim - to document&#xD;
      the process of implementation of community-based interventions at scale to promote selected&#xD;
      key family and community practices related to child health. This documentation and monitoring&#xD;
      of the implementation will be conducted both qualitatively and quantitatively to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and to document how and why the&#xD;
      intervention may or may not work. A combination of qualitative and quantitative documentation&#xD;
      is important to triangulate the findings of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of the C-IMCI component of IMCI will involve a series of processes, undertaken&#xD;
      by the government. To identify the lessons learnt from the processes so that they may be&#xD;
      useful in other settings and for the intervention itself, documentation and monitoring of key&#xD;
      processes are very important. Five key processes have been identified for documentation -&#xD;
      situation analysis, partnerships with NGOs, training, implementation and community&#xD;
      perceptions and as mentioned earlier, these processes will be documented both qualitatively&#xD;
      and quantitatively. While routine MIS data and other questionnaires will be analysed for&#xD;
      quantitative documentation, for qualitative documentation, periodic in-depth studies will be&#xD;
      carried out with community members, different health care providers and other populations&#xD;
      involved with the intervention. These processes along with the system for process&#xD;
      documentation are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Documenting situation analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
           The process by which the Upazilla health manager conducts the situation analysis of the&#xD;
           human resources and communication mediums available in the upazilla will be documented.&#xD;
           This will include documentation of what method and sources are used to establish the&#xD;
           number of government health workers (health assistants and family welfare assistants),&#xD;
           village doctors, NGO health workers. Additionally the methods and sources of determining&#xD;
           who in the community are considered opinion leaders, the number of mosques and imams&#xD;
           will be documented. Especially important to this process is to document the confounding&#xD;
           factors that may effect the inclusion or exclusion of human resources or communication&#xD;
           mediums (e.g. village doctors may not be included because they do not wish to&#xD;
           participate, NGOs may be excluded because of lack of necessary skills or infrastructure&#xD;
           etc.). This will be documented prior to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Documenting the development of Partnerships with NGOs&#xD;
&#xD;
           Creation of cross-institutional partnerships is a major and innovative part of the&#xD;
           proposal. For this reason the documentation of this process is vitally important for its&#xD;
           application in other areas of Bangladesh and outside of Bangladesh. Documentation of how&#xD;
           partnerships with NGOs are established, the roles of the government and the NGO in the&#xD;
           partnership, modes of communication and other factors affecting the functioning of the&#xD;
           partnership should be identified. Further to this the relationships of the partner&#xD;
           organization with mothers, workers and community leaders need to be documented. This&#xD;
           will be documented through out the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Documenting training&#xD;
&#xD;
           The government will facilitate a training module for each component of the intervention&#xD;
           (R1-R5). The major goal of documentation will be to record the process of the training&#xD;
           and the quality of the training. In doing so, special focus will be given to the&#xD;
           recruitment methods of trainers and participants, their attendance, completion of the&#xD;
           training modules, factors affecting their participation, their knowledge retention,&#xD;
           attitudes to training and intentions to practice what they have learnt. This will be&#xD;
           documented at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Documenting implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
           GoB has authority over the planning and implementation of the C-IMCI interventions.&#xD;
           Development of the interventions has already taken place however continued revisions,&#xD;
           planning and monitoring is expected to continue through the implementation process. The&#xD;
           implementation process as conducted by the District and Upazilla as well as National&#xD;
           Core Committee will be documented and monitored. The operations, planning activities and&#xD;
           decision making processes will be observed and documented through meeting records, and&#xD;
           interviews with the District and Upazilla as well as National Core Committee staff. Of&#xD;
           key importance will be the documentation of decision making processes to observe how and&#xD;
           for what reason actionable decisions are made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Documenting community perceptions Prior to implementation of the intervention,&#xD;
           documentation of attitudes of the community at baseline will be conducted. This will&#xD;
           address the community's current attitudes towards the health system and health workers&#xD;
           currently available, care-seeking patterns, and areas of demand (for example what&#xD;
           services would they like to get from health workers). In addition to this, documentation&#xD;
           of different community leaders and health care providers (including teachers, opinion&#xD;
           leaders, religious leaders, village doctors, government health workers etc) will be held&#xD;
           to determine their current attitudes to the health system, their perceived barriers to&#xD;
           accessing health needs and areas of demand. The same activities will be conducted at the&#xD;
           end of the intervention. This will particularly focus on documenting changes in the&#xD;
           community's health care-seeking behaviour, changes in knowledge and attitudes of the&#xD;
           community leaders and heath care providers, social participation of the community&#xD;
           leaders and religious leaders in health care, mother's interactions with outreach&#xD;
           workers and community leaders and the perceived benefits and disadvantages of the&#xD;
           component approaches to improving child health. These documentations will take place&#xD;
           periodically throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation for each process will be in the form of reports providing a brief overview,&#xD;
      rationale, objectives and description of the process. Each report will record the process and&#xD;
      lessons learned by identifying the key phases of each process, the factors which affect these&#xD;
      phases, how these factors relate to each phase and to each other and confounding or external&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for documentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have an anthropologist to carry out the qualitative documentation. The&#xD;
      following methods will be used to document the intervention implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Documenting situation analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. In-depth semi-structured interviews will be carried out with Upazilla health managers&#xD;
           to ascertain which method and sources were used to establish what type and how many&#xD;
           health providers are available in the upazilla, who in the community were opinion&#xD;
           leaders and the number and mosques and imams as well as the confounding factors that may&#xD;
           have effected the inclusion or exclusion of these human resources/communication mediums:&#xD;
           7 (one from each intervention upazilla)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Documenting the development of partnerships with NGOs&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Focus group discussion will be conducted to understand community's knowledge,&#xD;
                attitudes and expectations towards the partner NGOs: 14 (2 in each of the 6 7&#xD;
                intervention upazillas, one with women and one with men)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. In-depth semi-structured interviews will be carried out with focal persons of both&#xD;
                GoB and partner NGOs who will be in charge of enrolling the partnership to&#xD;
                understand the modes of communication and other associating factors while working&#xD;
                together: the number of respondents for this component will be determined in the&#xD;
                field since the number of NGOs involved in the intervention areas is unknown. 2 GoB&#xD;
                focal persons from each intervention upazilla will be selected for interview (14&#xD;
                persons total).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Documenting training&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Focus group discussions will be carried out with the participants of the training&#xD;
                to understand their perceptions and attitudes regarding the training and the&#xD;
                intervention: the number of focus group discussions for this component will be&#xD;
                based on the number of training sessions conducted. We will be doing one group&#xD;
                discussion for each training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. In-depth semi-structured interviews will be carried out with trainers to understand&#xD;
                their perceptions regarding the training module, time allocated for the training&#xD;
                and participant's attitudes: the number of in-depth interviews for this component&#xD;
                will be based on the number of training sessions conducted. We will be doing one&#xD;
                trainer interview from each training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Documenting implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. In-depth semi-structured interviews will be conducted with the District and&#xD;
                Upazilla as well as National Core Committee of DGHS members to ascertain their&#xD;
                attitudes and understanding of decision making processes surrounding the&#xD;
                implementation of the C-IMCI intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Regular attendance at the District and Upazilla as well as National Core Committee&#xD;
                meetings to observe decision making processes, structure of meetings, and the main&#xD;
                issues discussed will be conducted. The observer will in particular be documenting&#xD;
                the processes for planning and decision making by taking into account how issues&#xD;
                are raised and managed. The number of observation attendances at the meetings will&#xD;
                be based on the number of meetings held.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Documenting community perceptions&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In-depth semi-structured interviews will be carried out with community members (both&#xD;
           married women and men) to understand their current attitudes towards the health system&#xD;
           and health workers, care-seeking patterns for child health and their demand: 42&#xD;
           respondents (6 from each intervention upazilla and among them three interviews will be&#xD;
           with married women and three will be with married men having children/grandchildren age&#xD;
           under five years of age.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In-depth semi-structured interviews with community leaders (teachers, opinion leaders,&#xD;
           religious leaders) will be carried out to understand their current attitudes towards the&#xD;
           health system and health workers, care-seeking patterns for child health and their&#xD;
           demand: 21 respondents (one from each category in each intervention upazilla).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In-depth semi-structured interviews with health workers (village doctors, traditional&#xD;
           healers, HA, FWA, and other Govt. and NGO health workers who are currently available in&#xD;
           the community) will be carried out to understand their current role, their attitudes&#xD;
           towards the health system and their perceptions: 42 respondents (one from each category&#xD;
           in each upazilla).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At end-line The same number and type of interviews will be conducted at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention. However, this piece of work will particularly focus on changes in the&#xD;
      community's health care-seeking behaviour, changes in knowledge and attitudes of the&#xD;
      community leaders and health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to baseline and end-line, data collection may also take place with these types of&#xD;
      respondents throughout the study to understand the ongoing changes or if there is any changes&#xD;
      in the community over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIS data and other questionnaires will be used to document the intervention quantitatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation and monitoring of the performance of the community based health workers&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the adequacy of the implementation of the proposed intervention it is necessary to&#xD;
      regularly document and monitor the performance of the community based health workers. Both&#xD;
      utilization of the community based health workers and quality of care will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilization of Community Based Health Workers Quantitative data will be collected from&#xD;
      routine MIS, e.g., patient registers, referral slips, reports, drug utilization registers as&#xD;
      well as reports from referral centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Care of provided by Health Workers Existing generic MCE -IMCI health facility&#xD;
      survey tools will be modified, translated and used to assess the quality of care at first&#xD;
      level facility and at community. Information will be collected through observation of case&#xD;
      management using a standard checklist, exit interviews with care givers, re-examination of&#xD;
      each child with &quot;gold standard&quot; surveyor, interviews with health care providers and an audit&#xD;
      of the supplies and equipment available at the facilities and with the community health&#xD;
      workers. Quality of care and facility preparedness for antenatal checkups at GoB first level&#xD;
      health facilities will be assessed using a standard checklist. Quality will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and end line of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring effectiveness of C-IMCI intervention implementation is the primary objective of&#xD;
      this project. The principle outcome indicators are under-five child mortality, appropriate&#xD;
      care seeking for childhood illness, exclusive breast feeding and nutritional status (weight&#xD;
      for age). The secondary outcome indicators include number of antenatal care received by women&#xD;
      during pregnancy; deliveries conducted by trained birth attendants; mothers and newborns who&#xD;
      received postnatal care from a trained provider; newborn received drying and wrapping and&#xD;
      bath delayed by at least three days ; newborn breastfed within 1 hour of birth, and infants&#xD;
      0-5 months exclusively breastfeed . These indicators will be measured on a population of&#xD;
      children aged 0-5 years and women who have given birth in last one year and compared between&#xD;
      C-IMCI intervention areas and comparison areas. Primary comparisons will be made on the basis&#xD;
      of key indicators measured over the last two years of the project. However, baseline rates&#xD;
      will be estimated to identify any differences between the two arms at project commencement&#xD;
      and to make before and after comparisons within intervention arm. Special evaluations will be&#xD;
      designed during the course of the intervention implementation to understand and assess C-IMCI&#xD;
      intervention sub-components based on both MIS and independently collected data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household surveys of selected households in each upazila will provide information on&#xD;
      indicators such as under-five child mortality, exclusive breast feeding, newborn breastfed&#xD;
      within 1 hour of birth, infants 0-5 months exclusively breastfed, antenatal care received by&#xD;
      women during pregnancy; deliveries conducted by trained birth attendants, newborn dried and&#xD;
      wrapped immediately after bath and delayed bathing, child nutritional status (weight,&#xD;
      height/length), under-5 morbidity, care-seeking practices associated with the episodes of&#xD;
      morbidity, practices relating to home care and case management, and compliance with health&#xD;
      care advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cost-effectiveness analyses of the facility and community IMCI interventions activities&#xD;
      the study will also track costs and make estimates of the cost-effectiveness of different&#xD;
      IMCI intervention models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household Surveys Three large household surveys will be carried out in the selected study&#xD;
      population, first at commencement, at midterm and then at the end of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each household coverage survey a fresh sample of household will be selected from each&#xD;
      upazila. The sample HHs will be drawn through a multi-stage sampling process. In each&#xD;
      upazila, first villages will be randomly selected by probability proportional to size (PPS)&#xD;
      sampling and in the second stage a fixed number of households will be selected randomly from&#xD;
      the household lists of the selected villages to reach the desired number of households. Each&#xD;
      village will be mapped and all households of the selected villages will be listed. The&#xD;
      household lists will contain bari name and household head name of every existing household.&#xD;
      Data collectors will identify the sampled households in each village (cluster) and will&#xD;
      complete interviews of caretakers of all available under-5 children in the households,&#xD;
      including mothers of newborns born in the previous 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline survey will be completed within first 6 months of the project and using a&#xD;
      Demographic Health Survey-type instrument. The instrument used by the IMCI-MCE study in&#xD;
      Matlab, Bangladesh and Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2007 (BDHS) will be adapted,&#xD;
      and used for this purpose. Information on socio-economic and demographic variables, practices&#xD;
      and care during pregnancy, delivery and after delivery, immediate newborn care, care seeking&#xD;
      practices for under-five children with the episodes of morbidity, practices relating to home&#xD;
      care and case management, contact with service providers, compliance with health care advice,&#xD;
      and user costs will be collected. Morbidity data will be based on 2-weeks recall of diarrhea,&#xD;
      ARI and other serious illnesses. Causes of under-5 deaths, water and sanitation conditions&#xD;
      and other possible confounders or correlates of mortality will be collected through this&#xD;
      baseline survey so that any differences between the intervention and comparison arms at&#xD;
      baseline can be adjusted for in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The midterm survey will provide insight on the direction and achievements of the project&#xD;
      objectives and will be used for any modification of intervention. The end-of-project (EoP)&#xD;
      survey (in year 4) will be completed with similar tools that used at baseline. The EoP survey&#xD;
      will be completed in last 6 months period. A mortality survey module will be included in the&#xD;
      End of Project survey. The data will be used to estimate baseline mortality levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analyses of the facility and community IMCI interventions activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of cost-effectiveness analyses of the facility and community IMCI&#xD;
      intervention the study will also track costs and make estimates of the cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      different IMCI interventions (Facility and Community IMCI). The analyses of both costs and&#xD;
      effects will generate 2 cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of costs per YLS (Years of Life&#xD;
      Saved).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total costs of IMCI/YLS from treating all under-five based on facility and community&#xD;
           IMCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incremental costs of introducing community IMCI (aggregate approach)/difference in YLS&#xD;
           between intervention and comparison districts. This will show if the additional costs&#xD;
           adding community IMCI into the current system justified the additional health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost data will be collected in three facility IMCI upazilas and three facility and community&#xD;
      IMCI upazilas from societal perspective. Programme intervention costs (in case of facility&#xD;
      and community IMCI), which can be directly compared to changes in outcome measures in&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis, will be collected by the research team and will include payments&#xD;
      to health workers; training courses for health workers; drugs, supplies, and all other&#xD;
      activities in the course of the intervention; and amortized capital costs (equipment,&#xD;
      vehicles, buildings). We will track and include capital costs, using depreciation techniques&#xD;
      to calculate the portion of the investment cost that is appropriate to include in the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness calculation. Users' costs (individuals and families) will be measured&#xD;
      through the household surveys. These costs include any direct financial payments for&#xD;
      services, as well as transportation costs and the amount of time that individuals spend to&#xD;
      use the services of the intervention. Time costs will be translated into financial costs&#xD;
      based on the economic level of the household, as measured by the household survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to efforts to capture programme and users' costs we will capture Provider costs&#xD;
      associated with project activities. Data collection will focus on the amassing of all costs&#xD;
      associated with the provision of IMCI services at the health facility and community levels.&#xD;
      Major direct cost categories will include costs associated with staff time treating under 5&#xD;
      children drugs and all other community activities. While major indirect cost categories will&#xD;
      include building costs (e.g. percent of capital and recurrent costs, including electricity&#xD;
      and maintenance costs); a proportion of non-medical staff salary costs (e.g. cleaning staff,&#xD;
      security guards) etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey management and Quality control&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will recruit data collectors and their local supervisors at upazilla level.&#xD;
      Training of the Trainors (ToT) will be arranged at Dhaka and training of the data collectors&#xD;
      will be arranged at upazilla level. All training, data collection process, progress and&#xD;
      quality will be closely monitored by the central team at ICDDR,B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality and Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      All questionnaires and data forms will be reviewed for accuracy, consistency and&#xD;
      completeness. Repeat interviews will be conducted in a 5% sample of the households. The&#xD;
      Project Coordinator and investigators will make periodic field visits to observe data&#xD;
      collection by the interviewers. All data will be entered in databases using on-line&#xD;
      custom-designed data entry programmes with necessary range and consistency checks built in.&#xD;
      Data will be periodically checked by running and reviewing frequency distributions and cross&#xD;
      tabulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      No children in the study area will be deprived of existing health care services or other&#xD;
      services scheduled to be implemented in the area during the study period. Children of the&#xD;
      intervention area are expected to be benefited from the interventions to promote family and&#xD;
      community practices, e.g., through the intensive education of the families and communities on&#xD;
      improved child caring and care seeking. If the study hypothesis is proven to be correct,&#xD;
      community IMCI could be scaled up and all the children in the study area will be benefited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation and Outcome Variable(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation Since the upazila is the unit of randomization, sample size&#xD;
      calculations have been carried out to determine the number of households needed for detecting&#xD;
      expected declines in under-5 mortality/1,000 live births, assuming 7 upazilas in each group,&#xD;
      and allowing for cluster level randomization. The formula estimates the number of clusters&#xD;
      need for given cluster size (n). Since we know the number of clusters in each group is fixed&#xD;
      at 6 7, we can also use the formula to estimate cluster size (n) for a given indicator. Here&#xD;
      k is the coefficient of variation of the true (population) proportions between clusters&#xD;
      within each group. The estimation was done iteratively based on the t-distribution,&#xD;
      confidence levels of 95%, and 80% power, and assuming refusal rate of 20% and an expected 20%&#xD;
      reduction in under-5 mortality. Thus we get 6 clusters required for each of the arms&#xD;
      (intervention and comparison).&#xD;
&#xD;
      9,375households are needed for each upazila to measure 20% under-5 mortality reduction. The&#xD;
      sample HHs will be drawn through a multi-stage sampling process. In the first stage 60&#xD;
      villages will be selected with probability proportional to size from each upazila and in the&#xD;
      second stage fixed number of households will be randomly selected from those 60 villages to&#xD;
      reach the 9,375 households. If a selected village does not include enough households then we&#xD;
      will add households from the nearest village.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub-sample of 930 households including 110 households with women who have given birth in&#xD;
      last one year from each upazila will be required for the baseline, midterm and final&#xD;
      household coverage surveys. At first stage 30 villages will be selected from each upazila by&#xD;
      PPS sampling and in the second stage 31 households will be randomly selected from the&#xD;
      household list. If a selected village does not include enough households then we will add&#xD;
      households from the nearest village. The same procedure will be repeated for each survey to&#xD;
      draw the fresh sample of 930 households. Data collectors will identify the sampled households&#xD;
      and will interview caretakers of all available under-5 children in the household, including&#xD;
      mothers of newborns who given birth in the previous 12 months&#xD;
