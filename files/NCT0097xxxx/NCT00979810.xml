  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate high and low areas of growth, or proliferation,&#xD;
      within the tumor. An imaging technique using a very small amount of a radioactive tracer&#xD;
      called 18Ffluoro-deoxy-L-thymidine (18F-FLT) can detect areas of rapid growth within the&#xD;
      tumor. This imaging technique is called a FLT PET imaging. This present study involves&#xD;
      obtaining one scan using FLT PET imaging. The goal of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      associations between the imaging findings showing differences in growth rate within the tumor&#xD;
      and the biology of the tumor that is measured in the sampled tumor tissue. This information&#xD;
      may be used in future brain tumor patients to determine the best combination of treatment for&#xD;
      individual patients. These studies may also improve our understanding of the types of changes&#xD;
      taking place in brain tumor tissue that could improve individual patient outcome. FLT is&#xD;
      produced for human use by the MSKCC cyclotron facility under an investigational new drug&#xD;
      (IND) approval issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that FLT is&#xD;
      produced under strict rules and regulations, is considered safe, and has been approved for&#xD;
      use in humans for certain disease conditions. 18F-FLT has been used in several research&#xD;
      studies to date at this institution.&#xD;

A IV catheter will be placed in a superficial hand or arm vein for administration of 18F-FLT (approximately 370 MBq), prepared by the MSKCC Radiochemistry Core Facility. A second venous catheter will be placed in the opposite hand or arm for venous blood sampling. If a central venous catheter is present, it will be used for blood sampling or radiopharmaceutical administration, and only a single venous catheter will be placed. Sequential blood samples may be obtained following 18F-FLT infusion for assaying whole blood and plasma radioactivity. All catheters will be removed at the end of the day.</description>
