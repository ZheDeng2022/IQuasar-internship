  <brief_summary>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSA (prostate specific antigen) is a protein found on normal and cancerous prostate&#xD;
           cells. Levels of this protein are used to identify men who are at risk for prostate&#xD;
           cancer and to monitor responses to treatment in men who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
           prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research has shown that men who continue to have an elevated PSA level following primary&#xD;
           treatment for prostate cancer are at increased risk for cancer progression. Studies have&#xD;
           shown that the change in PSA levels over time, or PSA doubling time (PSADT), can be&#xD;
           accurate in predicting how quickly the cancer is likely to progress. Individuals with a&#xD;
           PSADT of less than 3 months are at extremely high risk for disease progression and death&#xD;
           from prostate cancer. Individuals with a PSADT of greater than 15 months have a very low&#xD;
           risk of death from prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TARP is a protein that is found in about 95% of prostate cancers and is known to&#xD;
           stimulate the immune system. The TARP prostate cancer vaccine is made from pieces of the&#xD;
           TARP protein called peptides and includes peptides that have been modified to make them&#xD;
           more effective at stimulating immunity. Although these TARP peptides have been shown to&#xD;
           stimulate the immune systems of mice, information is needed to determine if they also&#xD;
           stimulate the immune system in humans. Since it is unclear what is the best way to give&#xD;
           peptide vaccines, the TARP peptides will be given with substances known to stimulate the&#xD;
           immune system or in a vaccine made with the patient s own cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the immune system s response to vaccination with TARP peptides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and toxicity of TARP peptide vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if vaccination with the TARP prostate cancer vaccine can slow down PSADT in&#xD;
           men with an intermediate PSADT of 3 to 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Males 18 years of age and older who have completed their primary treatment for prostate&#xD;
           cancer, have stage D0 disease, are HLA A*0201 positive and who have a PSADT greater than&#xD;
           3 and less than 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A will receive the TARP vaccine with other substances that stimulate the immune&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B will receive the TARP vaccine that includes a patient s own white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First week of study, after screening for eligibility has been completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: Apheresis procedure to extract white blood cells to test the immune response to&#xD;
           the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3: Flu vaccine to allow researchers to determine how well a patient s immune system&#xD;
           is working.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic visits in Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 for physical examination, blood samples, and&#xD;
           administration of the TARP peptide vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and blood samples only in Weeks 18 and 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional blood samples and apheresis procedures in Weeks 24 and 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 6th dose of TARP peptide vaccine will be administer to those patients who have a&#xD;
           response to vaccination at week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No follow-up or long-term study is associated with this study.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-cell receptor alternate reading frame protein (TARP) is expressed by both normal and&#xD;
           malignant prostate cancer tissue and is found in about 95% of prostate cancer specimens.&#xD;
           TARP is immunogenic and hence is a target antigen for vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immunogenicity of TARP peptides can be augmented through epitope enhancement that is&#xD;
           achieved through amino acid substitutions resulting in increased peptide binding&#xD;
           affinity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two HLA-A*0201 TARP peptide epitopes are associated with generation of catalytic T-cell&#xD;
           responses: TARP27-35 and TARP29-37. Substitution of Val for Leu at position 9 in&#xD;
           TARP29-37, results in a peptide with increased binding affinity (TARP29-37-9V) that&#xD;
           induces antigen specific T cells able to recognize wild type and multiple modified TARP&#xD;
           peptides. The affinity of the TARP 27-35 peptide, corresponding to a distinct but&#xD;
           overlapping epitope, is high enough that no enhancement was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage D0 prostate cancer patients have no evidence of visceral or bony metastatic&#xD;
           disease but have persistently elevated or rising PSA levels (biochemical progression)&#xD;
           and are at increased risk for disease progression. Since they lack much of the immune&#xD;
           dysfunction associated with the high tumor burden characteristic of end-stage metastatic&#xD;
           disease, they are an ideal population in which to study therapeutic vaccination to slow&#xD;
           or prevent disease recurrence and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system&#xD;
           and are being studied extensively for anti-tumor activity in a broad spectrum of cancer&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As the optimal method for therapeutic immunization with peptide vaccines in patients&#xD;
           with cancer is unclear, vaccination with TARP peptides in Montanide ISA 51 VG adjuvant&#xD;
           plus Sargramostim will be studied in a randomized fashion with autologous, TARP&#xD;
           peptide-pulsed DCs in HLA-A*0201 Stage D0 prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of TARP peptide and TARP peptide-pulsed dendritic cell&#xD;
           vaccination in patients with Stage D0 prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the T-lymphocyte immune responses to TARP peptide vaccination with Montanide&#xD;
           ISA 51 VG plus Sargramostim or autologous dendritic cells as measured by tetramer&#xD;
           staining, IFN-gamma ELISPOT and (51)Cr release CTL assays.&#xD;

           3 months are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a randomized, prospective, pilot study of vaccination with a mixture of wild&#xD;
           type (TARP27-35) and epitope-enhanced (TARP29-37-9V) TARP peptides in HLA-A*0201&#xD;
           patients with stage D0 prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccination with TARP peptides admixed with Montanide ISA 51 VG plus Sargramostim&#xD;
           administered by deep subcutaneous injection will be compared with vaccination with TARP&#xD;
           peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells (DCs) administered intradermally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autologous dendritic cells will be matured from peripheral blood monocytes with&#xD;
           Sargramostim, IL-4, IFN-gamma and LPS and pulsed with wild type and epitope-enhanced&#xD;
           TARP peptides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apheresis will be performed on all patients at weeks 0, 24, 48 and 96.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization and assignment to received TARP peptide vaccine with Montanide ISA 51 VG&#xD;
           plus Sargramostimgiven by deep subcutaneous injection or TARP peptide-pulsed autologous&#xD;
           DCs given ID will be performed at week 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (FluMist ) when seasonally&#xD;
           available at the very end of their week 0 visit as a control vaccine to assess cytotoxic&#xD;
           T lymphocyte responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TARP Peptide vaccines will be administered every three weeks at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and&#xD;
           15, with a sixth and seventh booster dose of vaccine at Week 48 and 96. Follow-up will&#xD;
           be through 144 weeks on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial uses an optimal 2-stage design targeting an immunologic response between 10&#xD;
           and 40%. We will initially accrue 9 patients in each arm. If 0-1 patients develop an&#xD;
           immunologic response, then no further patients will be enrolled. If 2 or more of these&#xD;
           patients develop an immunologic response, we will accrue 11 additional patients for a&#xD;
           maximum total of up to 20 patients in each arm. A stopping rule for excessive toxicity&#xD;
           will be incorporated.&#xD;
