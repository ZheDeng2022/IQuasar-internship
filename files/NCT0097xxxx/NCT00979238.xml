  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of giving a normal factor IX gene to&#xD;
      treat individuals who have an abnormal or no factor IX gene. Recruitment will be limited to&#xD;
      adults (≥ 18 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of hemophilia B (HB), resulting from a&#xD;
      missense mutation in the coagulation factor IX (FIX) gene or a nonsense mutation that has not&#xD;
      been associated with an inhibitor. Only subjects who have no evidence of active hepatitis or&#xD;
      anti-hFIX antibodies, and who have been treated/exposed to Factor IX concentrates for at&#xD;
      least ten years and have had an average of 3 bleeding episodes per year requiring FIX&#xD;
      administration will be enrolled. Patients will be recruited within the United States for&#xD;
      treatment at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and patients will be recruited in England&#xD;
      and other countries for treatment in London by our British collaborators.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia B is caused by an absence or abnormality in the gene that produces the factor IX&#xD;
      protein. Affected individuals cannot make a blood clot effectively and suffer from severe&#xD;
      bleeding episodes. Repeated bleeding episodes, specifically into joints, can cause chronic&#xD;
      joint disease and lead to disability. This research study will test the safety of giving an&#xD;
      affected individual a normal factor IX gene which can produce factor IX protein in his body.&#xD;
      We will give the normal gene for factor IX by using an inactivated (not able to function)&#xD;
      virus called &quot;the vector.&quot; The vector used in this study was developed from an&#xD;
      adeno-associated virus that has been changed so that it is unable to cause a viral infection&#xD;
      in humans. This inactivated virus was further altered to carry the factor IX gene and to&#xD;
      locate within liver cells where factor IX protein is normally made.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Treated/exposed to FIX products (e.g., concentrates or fresh frozen plasma) for at&#xD;
             least 10 years or 50 exposure days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of an average of 3 bleeding episodes per year requiring FIX infusions or&#xD;
             prophylactic FIX infusions because of frequent prior bleeding episodes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give informed consent and comply with requirements of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently free of inhibitor and have no history of inhibitors to FIX protein&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A negative family history for the development of an inhibitor,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active infection with Hepatitis B or C virus as reflected by HBsAg or NCV&#xD;
