      This study will be co-ordinated by Dr Hector Chinoy, Dr Robert G Cooper (Salford Royal NHS&#xD;
      Foundation Trust / The University of Manchester) and Dr Ian N Bruce (Central Manchester&#xD;
      University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust/ The University of Manchester). An initial pilot&#xD;
      study will be completed, to establish proof of concept of the study and to examine whether&#xD;
      trends may observed of differences between cases and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty five prevalent UK Caucasian adult IIM cases, confirmed by internationally accepted&#xD;
      criteria, will be recruited via the Adult Onset Myositis clinic, Salford Royal NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust. Age, gender and race-matched controls will be recruited on a 'best friend' system. At&#xD;
      the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility (WTCRF), The University of Manchester,&#xD;
      facilities are already available for B-mode ultrasound CIMT measurement, Endo-PAT, lean body&#xD;
      mass measurement and contrast echocardiography. Cases and controls will have their&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors assessed using a standardised questionnaire and blood tests.&#xD;
      Further tests performed will include blood pressure, electrocardiogram, lean body mass,&#xD;
      B-mode ultrasound CIMT measurement and Endo-PAT. IIM cases will have additional blood tests&#xD;
      and a clinical assessment to assess their disease status, and contrast echocardiography. As&#xD;
      part of a linked study, subjects (but not controls) will also have Gd-DTPA-MRI of the heart&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

      This study will be coordinated by Dr Hector Chinoy, Dr Robert G Cooper (Salford Royal NHS&#xD;
      Foundation Trust / The University of Manchester) and Dr Ian N Bruce (Central Manchester&#xD;
      University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust/ The University of Manchester). An initial pilot&#xD;
      study will be completed, to establish proof of concept of the study and to examine whether&#xD;
      trends may be observed of differences between cases and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty UK Caucasian adult IIM cases, confimed by internationally accepted criteria, will be&#xD;
      recruited via the Adult Onset Myositis clinic, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. Age,&#xD;
      gender and racematched controls will be recruited on a 'best friend' system. STUDY METHODS:In&#xD;
      order to establish whether CHD risk is increased in patients with myositis, we would like to&#xD;
      perform a pilot study, comparing the cardiovascular risk factors of 30 patient's from Salford&#xD;
      Royal's adult myositis clinic, with a group of 30 healthy controls. Participant would be&#xD;
      invited along to the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility (WTCRF), where all the&#xD;
      necessary tests would be performed at a 'one off' study visit. Participants would be asked to&#xD;
      bring along a friend of the same gender and roughly the same age, who would then comprise the&#xD;
      'healthy control' comparison group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study would involve a consultant clinician completing a 'heart disease questionnaire' for&#xD;
      each of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single blood sample would be taken to check their blood sugar levels and cholesterol, and&#xD;
      if they had myositis, disease activity would also be assessed. The non invasive diagnostic&#xD;
      testing would include an ultrasound of the blood vessels of the neck, checking for narrowing&#xD;
      of the arteries, and a special blood pressure test, looking for the early signs of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis (build up of fat in the blood vessels). An electrocardiogram (ECG) would be&#xD;
      performed, and if they have myositis, an ultrasound test of their heart (echocardiogram),&#xD;
      would also be performed. A gadoliniumenhanced magnetic resonance scan (GdDTPAMRI) of the&#xD;
      heart will be performed to examine for inflammation of the heart tissue (pericardium and&#xD;
      myocardium). The echo and MR will only be performed in patients, and not controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study demonstrated that patients with myositis had more chance of developing CHD, than&#xD;
      those in the control group, this would have implications for their future clinical care,&#xD;
      requiring close monitoring of patients for the early signs of CHD, and the appropriate&#xD;
      intervention when necessary. This study will be funded by the WTCRF Small Grants Award&#xD;
      Scheme.MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF STUDY METHODS:Cases and controls will have the following&#xD;
      recorded for assessment of cardiovascular risk factors: i) Standardised questionnaire to&#xD;
      ascertain basic details, e.g. age, ethnicity, medical and family history, drug use and&#xD;
      smoking. ii) Height and weight measurement. iii) Blood tests, including fasting blood sugar,&#xD;
      lipid profile &amp; Creactive protein. iv) Lean body mass measurement using a body composition&#xD;
      analyser. v) Electrocardiogram. v) Subclinical atherosclerosis measurement using Bmode&#xD;
      ultrasound CIMT. vi) Endothelial dysfunction measurement using EndoPAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases will additionally have the following to assess disease status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Clinical assessment of myositis disease activity (MITAX/MYOACT) and disease damage (MDI,&#xD;
      MYODAM). ii) Assessment of muscle strength using manual muscle testing. iii) Further bloods&#xD;
      including serum creatine kinase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serology including&#xD;
      antiphospholipid status. iv) Assessment of left ventricular/septal dysfunction, and&#xD;
      pericardial abnormalities using contrast echocardiography. vi) Assessment of the diagnostic&#xD;
      utility of GdDTPAMRI to assess myocardial disease activity in the presence of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. All procedures will be conducted by a technician or nurse employed within the WTCRF.&#xD;
      The clinical and muscle strength assessment will be performed by a medical practitioner (to&#xD;
      be appointed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the WTCRF, The University of Manchester, facilities are already available for Bmode&#xD;
      ultrasound CIMT measurement, EndoPAT, lean body mass measurement and contrast&#xD;
      echocardiography. Cases and controls will have their cardiovascular risk factors assessed&#xD;
      using a standardised questionnaire and blood tests. Further tests performed will include&#xD;
      blood pressure, electrocardiogram, lean body mass, Bmode ultrasound carotid artery narrowing&#xD;
      and EndoPAT. IIM cases will have additional blood tests and a clinical assessment to assess&#xD;
      their disease status. As part of a linked study, subjects (but not controls) will also have&#xD;
      GdDTPAMRI and contrast echocardiography of the heart performed. The primary research end&#xD;
      point will be the detection of significant patient/control group differences.&#xD;
