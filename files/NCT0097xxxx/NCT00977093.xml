  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (MR)&#xD;
      imaging is able to detect certain heart abnormalities, such as a coronary artery narrowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this purpose, a conventional MR contrast medium (Gd-DTPA-BMA) will be used during an&#xD;
      adenosine infusion (an approved substance which enlarges the arteries of the heart, so that&#xD;
      the blood flow to the heart muscle increases). This magnetic resonance imaging technique will&#xD;
      be compared with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a well-established&#xD;
      technique to detect this heart abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both, cardiac MR and SPECT will be compared with invasive coronary angiography, a technique&#xD;
      which directly visualized the heart vessels and narrowings of these (=standard of reference).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentre, open label, phase III study in adult subjects designed to show&#xD;
      that Gd-DTPA-BMA (a conventional MR contrast medium = OMNISCAN) enhanced myocardial MR&#xD;
      perfusion imaging is non-inferior to myocardial SPECT. Both imaging techniques will be&#xD;
      performed during adenosine stress (0.14mg/min/kg over 3 minutes IV). Gd-DTPA-BMA will be used&#xD;
      twice (2 doses of 0.075 mmol/kg for the stress and rest study each) for the detection of&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion defects. The standard of reference is invasive coronary angiography,&#xD;
      which defines the presence of coronary artery disease, if vessels of at least 2mm in diameter&#xD;
      show stenosis of at least 50% (diameter reduction). Patients with a history of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction(s) are positive for coronary artery disease, even when coronary arteries are not&#xD;
      stenosed as evidenced by the coronary angiography performed in the setting of this trial(=&#xD;
      assigning patients as positive for coronary artery disease after successful&#xD;
      PCI-revascularization of acute infarct(s) in the past).&#xD;
