  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GW642444 is a potent and selective long-acting beta2 agonist; GSK573719 is a long-acting,&#xD;
      inhaled, muscarinic receptor antagonist (or anticholinergic) bronchodilator. Both are in&#xD;
      development as once daily (QD) monotherapies for the treatment of Chronic Obstructive&#xD;
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Development of these two inhaled drugs as a combination therapy is&#xD;
      also planned and would have potential for improved efficacy and patient benefit as they both&#xD;
      work through different receptor pathways and the combined bronchodilatory effect might be&#xD;
      additive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study which&#xD;
      will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      GSK573719 and GW642444 in sixteen healthy Japanese subjects. Subjects will receive four&#xD;
      possible treatments as single inhaled doses, receiving the two monotherapies separately, the&#xD;
      monotherapies concurrently, and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken at regular intervals after dosing. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed by measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, ECG and twenty-four hour Holter&#xD;
      monitoring, potassium, safety laboratory data and review of adverse events.&#xD;

    <description>This is a four-way cross-over study. Subjects, healthy volunteers, will receive a single dose of GSK573719 (500ug), GW642444 (50ug), GSK573719 (500ug)+GW642444 (50ug) administered concurrently, or placebo at each of the four treatment periods. There is a minimum wash-out period of seven days between doses. On enrolment into the study, subjects will be assigned to one of four treatment sequences which are based on a Williams design in accordance with the randomization schedule generated by GSK prior to study start.</description>

             24hr Holter monitoring recording outside normal limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of breathing problems (i.e. history of asthmatic symptomatology, unless&#xD;
             asthma in childhood that has now resolved and no longer requires maintenance therapy&#xD;

             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.&#xD;
