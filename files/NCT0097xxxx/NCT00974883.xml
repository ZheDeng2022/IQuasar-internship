  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) causes inflammation and narrowing of blood vessels and can cause&#xD;
      blindness in one third of patients. It is important that a prompt, accurate diagnosis of GCA&#xD;
      is made and treatment given as steroids for two or more years. Currently there is no 100%&#xD;
      accurate test for GCA. Patients usually have new headache and scalp tenderness, typically&#xD;
      with an abnormal blood test. However, it can be difficult to distinguish non-serious forms of&#xD;
      headache from GCA; infection produces similar abnormal blood results. If there is a suspicion&#xD;
      of GCA, treatment with steroids is started straight away. To confirm a diagnosis, the patient&#xD;
      will need a biopsy of a temporal artery (a minor procedure performed under local anaesthetic&#xD;
      to remove a sample of one of the scalp arteries). However, up to 44% of patients will have a&#xD;
      normal biopsy. Therefore it is difficult to know if a patient with a normal biopsy does or&#xD;
      does not have GCA. Withdrawing steroid treatment may increase the risk of blindness.&#xD;
      Continuing treatment in a patient without GCA increases the risk of side effects (e.g.,&#xD;
      weight gain, infection risk, osteoporosis and fracture risk, high blood pressure, diabetes,&#xD;
      cataracts). It is important to improve diagnostic tests for GCA. Another test to help in&#xD;
      diagnosing GCA is an ultrasound scan of the arteries in the side of the head and under the&#xD;
      arms. Ultrasound does not involve surgery; it is a simple test which can be performed as an&#xD;
      out patient. Gel is applied to both sides of the head and under each arm. A sound probe is&#xD;
      placed over the artery at each site to produce the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' study will examine the role of ultrasound in diagnosis of 402 patients&#xD;
      with suspected GCA. All patients will have an ultrasound examination in addition to biopsy&#xD;
      within a week of starting steroids. Patients will be treated according to usual practice.&#xD;
      After six months, the investigators will reassess the diagnosis. The investigators will look&#xD;
      at the accuracy of ultrasound compared with or combined with biopsy. The investigators will&#xD;
      look at how a doctor's knowledge of ultrasound results or biopsy results alone would affect&#xD;
      the diagnosis and recommendation to continue or stop steroid treatment. The investigators&#xD;
      will assess whether knowledge of both results together would alter the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment. The investigators will collect information to estimate the costs of different ways&#xD;
      of diagnosing GCA in relation to the impact on quality of life.&#xD;

      OVERALL DESIGN: The overall design consists of a cohort study of 402 participants with&#xD;
      suspected GCA who will be followed up for 6 months; a cost-effectiveness study comparing&#xD;
      ultrasound with temporal artery biopsy; a study of observer agreement in evaluating&#xD;
      ultrasound and temporal artery biopsies; and an expert panel assessing the appropriateness of&#xD;
      alternative strategies for diagnosing and treating patients with suspected GCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of ultrasound as an&#xD;
           alternative to temporal artery biopsy for the diagnosis of GCA in patients referred for&#xD;
           biopsy with suspected GCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness (incremental cost per QALY) of ultrasound instead of&#xD;
           biopsy in the diagnosis of GCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate inter-observer agreement in the assessment of ultrasound and temporal artery&#xD;
           biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To elicit expert views on the appropriateness of performing a biopsy following&#xD;
           ultrasound using clinical vignettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the sequential&#xD;
           diagnostic strategy from 4 as an alternative to temporal artery biopsy alone in the&#xD;
           diagnosis of GCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness (incremental cost per QALY) of the diagnostic&#xD;
           strategy from 4 instead of biopsy alone in the diagnosis of GCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of ultrasound or biopsy of temporal&#xD;
      arteries on diagnosis of GCA and treatment decisions . The cohort study will use a paired&#xD;
      design, i.e. all participants will have both US and biopsy, with diagnostic performance&#xD;
      assessed against a composite reference standard diagnosis following final (6 months)&#xD;
      assessment. To evaluate the impact of US/biopsy results on clinical practice and longer term&#xD;
      outcomes, we will derive clinical vignettes based on cases recruited to the study, and&#xD;
      present them to the treating clinician, along with either the ultrasound, or biopsy or both&#xD;
      results, so that they can indicate diagnosis and proposed treatment. The main&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analyses will evaluate incremental cost per quality adjusted life year&#xD;
      (QALY) on a long term (lifetime) horizon between diagnostic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient and inpatient rheumatology and ophthalmology departments in 25 National Health&#xD;
      Service (NHS) trusts in the United Kingdom (UK) (also sites in Europe of required) with&#xD;
      access to high resolution US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARGET POPULATION: Patients with suspected GCA who would normally require an urgent temporal&#xD;
      artery biopsy, i.e. referrals from primary care and suspected GCA identified in secondary&#xD;
      care. Recruitment of participants will be restricted to patients for whom US and biopsy can&#xD;
      be performed within 7 days of starting high-dose steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES BEING ASSESSED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Halo, stenosis, or occlusion assessed by high resolution US; presence of giant cells or&#xD;
      granulomatous inflammation on temporal artery biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENT OF COST AND OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection at baseline, 2 weeks and 6 months will include clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      markers of disease activity, resource use, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the&#xD;
      EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), and adverse events. Baseline assessment will include retrospective&#xD;
      assessment of symptoms and erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C-reactive protein (ESR/CRP)&#xD;
      results before starting steroids. The reference standard diagnosis will be made using a&#xD;
      composite of American College of Rheumatology classification criteria, GCA-related events,&#xD;
      and alternative diagnoses using data collected at all assessments. Proposed treatment data&#xD;
      will be collected from participating clinicians after each test result is released, and&#xD;
      classified as treatment for GCA (e.g. initiate/continue steroids) or not GCA (e.g.&#xD;
      withdraw/rapid taper of steroids) to compare changes in proposed treatment and evaluate&#xD;
      agreement with the reference diagnosis. Unit costs of resources used will be obtained from&#xD;
      nationally published sources where available. Modelling will estimate the impact of&#xD;
      diagnostic strategies on clinical outcomes (e.g. GCA complications and steroid related&#xD;
      adverse events), their costs and impact on HRQoL beyond study follow-up and within study&#xD;
      follow-up. Probabilities of events, their cost and impact will be obtained from study data, a&#xD;
      systematic literature review, or in the absence of relevant data, by formal elicitation of&#xD;
      expert opinion. Costs and benefits will be discounted at 3.5% (National Institute for Health&#xD;
      and Care Excellence [NICE] guidance) and uncertainty (including modelling assumptions)&#xD;
      subjected to probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 402 patients provides 90% power at a 5% type I error rate to test the joint&#xD;
      hypothesis that (i) US has greater sensitivity than biopsy (to detect an increase in&#xD;
      sensitivity from 76% for biopsy (assuming a 0.24 false negative fraction based on 9-44%&#xD;
      biopsy-negative GCA) to 87% sensitivity for US; and (ii) to detect specificity of US of no&#xD;
      less than 0.83 based on an expected specificity of 0.96. This sample size will allow&#xD;
      estimation of a one-sided rectangular confidence region for US false and true positive&#xD;
      fractions, assuming 80% prevalence of GCA in patients having a biopsy for suspected GCA, with&#xD;
      the sample size inflated (gamma=0.1) due to uncertainty in the proportion of cases/controls&#xD;
      in a cohort design. We will actually recruit 430 cases to allow for possible drop-outs from&#xD;
      the study. In addition we will recruit 270 individuals for training purposes, to allow each&#xD;
      centre to learn the technique of temporal artery and axillary artery scanning. Each centre&#xD;
      will collect 10 such individuals (training cases), who will be of similar age and gender as&#xD;
      the study cohort, but who will not have temporal arteritis. This is very important in order&#xD;
      to ensure that observers are trained to recognise the appearances seen in normal (non GCA&#xD;
      arteries) especially patients with atherosclerosis. Further ultrasound training including a&#xD;
      video exam (to identify images of both normal and abnormal features of GCA) and a 'hot' case&#xD;
      assessment (scanning a patient with GCA) will be designed into the ultrasound training&#xD;
      programme. In addition, we will provide adequate training days (e.g. 2 separate training&#xD;
      days) when all observers will be trained formally by Dr Schmidt and other ultrasound experts&#xD;
      to ensure adequate observer agreement. The first training day will be held prior to starting&#xD;
      the recruitment of patients, and will be repeated after the first year.&#xD;
