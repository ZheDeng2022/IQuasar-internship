  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cediranib maleate when given&#xD;
      together with cilengitide in treating patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
      Cediranib maleate and cilengitide may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow&#xD;
      to the tumor. Giving cediranib maleate together with cilengitide may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of cediranib (cediranib maleate) in combination with&#xD;
      cilengitide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (Part A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate overall survival. II. To estimate the proportion of radiographic responses in&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma patients with measurable disease treated with cediranib and&#xD;
      cilengitide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months (APF6) in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated at the safe dose as determined in Part A (Part&#xD;
      B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore potential imaging techniques and biomarkers to capture the disease process&#xD;
      through treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cediranib maleate. Patients are initially&#xD;
      enrolled in the dose-finding portion of the study (part A). Once the safe dose of cediranib&#xD;
      maleate is determined, additional patients are enrolled in the dose-expansion portion of the&#xD;
      study (part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A (dose finding): Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily on days 1-28&#xD;
      and cilengitide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B (dose expansion): Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to prior anti-VEGF&#xD;
      therapy (yes vs no). Patients in both groups receive cediranib maleate (administered at the&#xD;
      safe dose determined in part A) and cilengitide as in part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 2 months.&#xD;
