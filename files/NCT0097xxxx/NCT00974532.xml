  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with normal kidney function are able to excrete in their urine the calcium and&#xD;
      phosphorus absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract and are thereby are able to maintain&#xD;
      calcium and phosphorus balance. Patients with chronic kidney disease often have normal blood&#xD;
      levels of calcium and phosphorus but no research has been conducted to determine if they are&#xD;
      able to excrete their daily intake of these minerals. If they are not able to excrete their&#xD;
      daily intake, these minerals could be deposited in soft tissue and blood vessels and&#xD;
      contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease seen in patients with chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease. This study will determine if subjects with chronic kidney disease are in&#xD;
      balance primarily with regard to calcium and at what level of kidney function they are no&#xD;
      longer able to maintain balance. Understanding whether patients with chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      are in balance will help direct future therapeutic interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) late Stage 3 and Stage 4 patients are no&#xD;
      longer able to maintain calcium balance by excreting their daily intake of calcium. We also&#xD;
      hypothesize that the retention of calcium is not reflected in the serum concentration, as the&#xD;
      body attempts to maintain the serum calcium concentration within narrow limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate balance at two different levels of calcium intake. The two different levels&#xD;
      were chosen to be at the extremes of normal calcium intake to provide insight into balance at&#xD;
      low normal and high normal loads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific expected experimental finding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directional Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late Stage 3/Stage 4 CKD patients (Estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15-40&#xD;
      ml/min/m2) will excrete 20% of the absorbed calcium on the high calcium (2000 mg) diet. On&#xD;
      the low calcium (800 mg) diet, CKD stage 4 patients will excrete 50% of the absorbed calcium.&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal absorption will be 20% on both diets resulting in a net positive calcium&#xD;
      balance of 320 mg on the high calcium intake and 80 mg on the lower calcium intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with normal kidney function (eGRF &gt; 60 ml/min/m2) will excrete &gt; 90% of the absorbed&#xD;
      calcium on the high calcium diet and &gt; 90% of the absorbed calcium on the low calcium diet.&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal absorption will be 20% on both diets resulting in no net positive calcium&#xD;
      balance on the high calcium intake or the lower calcium intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late Stage 3/Stage 4 CKD patients (eGFR 15-40 ml/min/m2) will excrete 60% of their absorbed&#xD;
      phosphorus on the 1600 mg phosphate diet. Normal subjects(eGRF &gt; 60 ml/min/m2) will be&#xD;
      expected to excrete &gt; 90% of the absorbed phosphorus on the 1600 mg phosphate diet.&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal phosphate absorption is expected to be 60% on both diets resulting in a net&#xD;
      positive phosphorus balance of 192 mg and 384 mg in late stage 3/stage 4 CKD respectively. In&#xD;
      addition, we hypothesize a decrease in fractional excretion of absorbed phosphorus as eGFR&#xD;
      decreases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal will be to study the following groups of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Late Stage 3/Stage 4 CKD (eGFR 15-40 ml/min/m²)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Normal subject(eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min/m²)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be calculated by the four variable&#xD;
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation which includes the serum creatinine,&#xD;
      patients' age, gender and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with CKD will be recruited from the clinical practices of the nephrology division at&#xD;
      the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center (HSC) by their nephrologists who will&#xD;
      screen them for stable CKD based on historical laboratory data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent and prior to the start of the study, patients will be evaluated to&#xD;
      determine whether they are vitamin D replete. Vitamin D deficiency is common not only in the&#xD;
      elderly and chronically ill, but also in young healthy adults, especially at the end of&#xD;
      winter. In a study of young healthy adults, ages 18 to 29, 36% of 69 subjects were found to&#xD;
      be dihydroxy-vitamin D (Vitamin D 25-OH) deficient at the end of winter compared with 4% by&#xD;
      the end of summer (13). For this reason, all patients will be assessed for Vitamin D 25-OH&#xD;
      repletion prior to initiating the study diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be accomplished by checking serum Vitamin D 25-OH levels in all patients. Those&#xD;
      with Vitamin D 25-OH levels less than 30 ng/mL will receive ergocalciferol 50,000 IU per week&#xD;
      x 4 week. This is the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guideline&#xD;
      recommendation for patients with CKD who are vitamin deficient. After that time, their&#xD;
      Vitamin D 25-OH levels will be checked again to assess whether they are replete (i.e., serum&#xD;
      level &gt; 30 ng/mL). If their serum level is again below 30 ng/mL, a second 4 week course of&#xD;
      ergocalciferol will be given. If the patient's serum Vitamin D 25-OH level remains &lt; 30 ng/mL&#xD;
      they will be excluded from further study. Once replete, subjects will remain on 50,000 IU&#xD;
      ergocalciferol monthly throughout the study. This will ensure that vitamin D substrate is not&#xD;
      a limiting factor in these patients. In addition the following medications will be&#xD;
      discontinued following informed consent and for at least 1 month prior to the start of the&#xD;
      first controlled diet, and for the duration of the study: paricalcitol, doxercalciferol,&#xD;
      rocaltrol, cinacalcet, calcium supplements including calcium containing vitamins, or&#xD;
      phosphate binders. Once patients are vitamin D replete they will have their calcium and&#xD;
      phosphorus determined and be excluded from the study if their phosphorus exceeds 4.5 mg/dL or&#xD;
      their calcium is outside the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be placed on two diets in random order for 9 days each. Randomization to diets&#xD;
      will be accomplished using Permuted blocks stratified by CKD stage. Patients will receive one&#xD;
      of two diets for each 9 day period, and then will subsequently go on the second diet after at&#xD;
      least a one week &quot;washout period&quot;. This wash-out period may last up to 4 weeks to accommodate&#xD;
      a patient's schedule or to study menstruating women during the same phase of their cycle.&#xD;
      Both patients and researchers will be blinded as to which diet the patients are receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last two days of each study period, patients will be admitted to the GCRC where they will&#xD;
      collect two consecutive 24 hour urines for calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and creatinine, as&#xD;
      well as a stool sample (see below) for calcium and phosphorus. The stool analysis for calcium&#xD;
      and phosphorus will be used to determine the amount of the ingested calcium and phosphorus&#xD;
      that is absorbed from the diet (fractional absorption), while the urinary calcium and&#xD;
      phosphorus will be used to determine the fraction of absorbed mineral excreted in the urine.&#xD;
      The urine sodium will be used to ensure stable dietary intake while the urinary creatinine&#xD;
      will be used to ensure that the urine collections are complete and to determine the tubular&#xD;
      reabsorption of phosphorus. A non-absorbable stool marker (Brilliant Blue) will be&#xD;
      administered to patients on the evening of their admission to the GCRC and again the second&#xD;
      evening in order to demarcate the time period over which the stool collected was formed. If&#xD;
      the patient has not passed the second marker by the end of the 48 hour period, they will be&#xD;
      asked to collect their stools at home and then bring them back to the General Clinical&#xD;
      Research Center (GCRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the final day of the patients' GCRC admission, after collection of the second 24 hour&#xD;
      urine sample is complete, a final small urine collection will be obtained. This last urine&#xD;
      sample will be used to measure spot calcium and phosphorus concentrations in order to compare&#xD;
      these values to the known amount excreted in the two previous 24 hour collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also have a small saliva sample, approximately 3 mL, collected during their&#xD;
      GCRC admission that will be used to measure salivary phosphorus concentration. These saliva&#xD;
      samples will be stored at the GCRC until a laboratory has been identified to perform this&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also have an overnight fasting serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, 1,25&#xD;
      vitamin D, 25 vitamin D, intact Parathyroid hormone (PTH), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)&#xD;
      23 levels measured at the completion of each 24 hour urine collection. In addition, patients&#xD;
      will have a serum phosphorus determination prior to their evening meal on both evenings of&#xD;
      their GCRC stay. After a &quot;wash-out&quot; period of at least one week patients will start the&#xD;
      second week-long diet, at the end of which they will be admitted to the GCRC for a two day&#xD;
      period. Patients may schedule their second diet period and GCRC stay within one to four weeks&#xD;
      of the previous diet and GCRC stay at their convenience. The diets will be prepared by the&#xD;
      GCRC nutrition staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet #1 (high-calcium diet):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elemental calcium 2000 mg, phosphorus 1600 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet#2 (low-calcium diet):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elemental calcium 800 mg, phosphorus 1600 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diets will have the same sodium and potassium concentrations, and will be diabetic 2000&#xD;
      kilocalorie (kCal)/ day diets. As the goal of this study is to focus on calcium balance,&#xD;
      which should not be affected by energy balance, there will be no adjustment for individuals&#xD;
      who are in negative or positive energy balance. During their stay in the GCRC subjects will&#xD;
      drink only deionized water or other beverages whose calcium and phosphorus content has been&#xD;
      included in the assessment of dietary calcium intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects will be counseled to only eat food prepared for the study protocol. They&#xD;
      will also be counseled to attempt to eat all of the food provided. They will be instructed to&#xD;
      bring in any food that is not consumed. They will also be asked to keep a diet history of any&#xD;
      food they eat that is not on the prepared diet. No supplemental vitamins, calcium, vitamin D,&#xD;
      or phosphate binders will be taken during the study period.&#xD;
