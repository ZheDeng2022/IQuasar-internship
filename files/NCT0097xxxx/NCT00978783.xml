      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with respiratory failure related to neuromuscular disease receive chronic&#xD;
      invasive ventilation through a tracheostomy. Improving quality of life, of which speech is an&#xD;
      important component, is a major goal in these patients. The investigators compared the&#xD;
      effects on breathing and speech of low-level positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP, 5 cm&#xD;
      H2O) and of a Passy-Muir speaking valve (PMV) during assist-control ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow will be measured using a pneumotachograph. Microphone speech recordings were subjected&#xD;
      to both quantitative measurements and qualitative assessments; these last consisted of a&#xD;
      perceptual score and an intelligibility score determined by two speech therapists using a&#xD;
      French adaptation of the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment.&#xD;

      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 10 ventilator-dependent patients with neuromuscular disease. All patients will&#xD;
      receive mechanical ventilation via a cuffless tracheostomy. The study protocol was approved&#xD;
      by our institutional review board, and written informed consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
      patients before study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental setup Ventilator-delivered flow will be measured using a pneumotachograph&#xD;
      (Fleisch #2, Lausanne, Switzerland) and tracheal pressure at the proximal end of the&#xD;
      tracheostomy tube using a differential pressure transducer (Validyne MP 45±100 cm H2O,&#xD;
      Northridge, CA, USA). To assess patient gas exchange, oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be&#xD;
      estimated using pulse oximetry (Ohmeda Biox, BOC Healthcare, Boulder, CO, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acoustic speech signals will be recorded using three methods. The signals recorded from a&#xD;
      microphone (DM202, MDE, Pierron, Sarreguemines, France) positioned 20 cm from the patient's&#xD;
      lips were routed to a microcomputer with an AD converter (MP150® and Acqknowledge®, Biopac&#xD;
      system, Goleta, CA, USA) that synchronized respiratory data (ventilator flow and tracheal&#xD;
      pressure) and acoustic data. The AD converter will digitize respiratory signals at 128 Hz and&#xD;
      speech signals at 20 000 Hz. The acoustic signal will be also routed to the Dragon&#xD;
      NaturallySpeaking 10® speech recognition system (Nuance; Burlington, MA, USA) with its&#xD;
      specific microphone and a laptop computer containing its speech recognition software.&#xD;
      Finally, the acoustic signal will be recorded on a digital recorder (DS55, Olympus®,&#xD;
      Herodphot, Manage, France) with a signal bandwidth between 50 and 19 000 Hz to allow&#xD;
      assessment of fundamental frequency and subsequent qualitative analysis by speech therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol All patients will be receiving ACV, the ventilation mode used in all&#xD;
      tracheostomized patients followed at our neuromuscular unit. VI, TI, backup rate, and&#xD;
      inspiratory trigger sensitivity will be kept unchanged. Before testing, patients will be&#xD;
      familiarized with the use of 5 cm H2O PEEP and of the PMV. These two conditions will be&#xD;
      tested in random order. With each condition, the patient first will use the Dragon&#xD;
      NaturallySpeaking 10® voice-training menu, which involves reading a text passage for 10&#xD;
      minutes to enable software training. Then, the patient will continuously utter the [a] sound&#xD;
      for as long as possible, read a list of words, utter the [a] sound in a glissando from high&#xD;
      pitch to low pitch then from low pitch to high pitch, and read a standard text passage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis RR, TI, VI, and the volume expired through the tracheostomy tube (VE) will be&#xD;
      measured based on the computerized flow signal. The difference between VI and VE will be used&#xD;
      as an approximation of the volume expired through the upper airway. Ventilator triggering by&#xD;
      the patient will be considered significant when RR exceeded the backup rate by at least 3&#xD;
      cycles/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speech will be evaluated by measuring the mean time spent speaking during the respiratory&#xD;
      cycle, time needed to read the text passage, ability of Dragon NaturallySpeaking 10® to&#xD;
      accurately recognize the spoken words, and perceptual analyses by two speech therapists&#xD;
      blinded to speech condition. The numbers of grammatical and phonological errors made by&#xD;
      Dragon NaturallySpeaking 10® during the standard text reading will be compared between PEEP&#xD;
      and PMV. The two speech therapists will assess the recordings presented in pairs, with PEEP&#xD;
      vs. PMV in random order. The intelligibility scale used will be a French adaptation of the&#xD;
      Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (0 to 8 scale). In addition, the speech therapists will&#xD;
      determine a perceptual score on a 0-128 scale developed by the French authors who adapted the&#xD;
      Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each trial, the patients will evaluate subjective respiratory comfort and&#xD;
      subjective speech comfort on 10-cm horizontal visual analog scales (VASs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All results will be expressed as means±standard deviation (SD).&#xD;
      Differences between the two conditions will be assessed using a paired t test. P values &lt;0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
