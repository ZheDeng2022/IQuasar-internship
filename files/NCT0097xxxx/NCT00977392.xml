      RATIONALE: Women who do not undergo routine cervical screening may be more likely to collect&#xD;
      a self-sample for human papillomavirus testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying self-sampling in women who do not undergo&#xD;
      routine cervical screening.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ascertain whether women who do not attend for cervical screening are more likely to&#xD;
           respond to the opportunity to collect a self-sample for human papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
           testing, or to respond to a further invitation to undergo a cervical smear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ascertain whether such women will attend for further investigation if they have a&#xD;
           positive screening test (HPV test or cervical smear).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control: Patients receive an invitation for a routine cervical smear and a cervical&#xD;
           screening survey. Information regarding attendance for smear or colposcopy is collected&#xD;
           at the Primary Care Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study (self-sampling kit): Patients receive an explanatory letter, an information sheet&#xD;
           about the study, a consent form, information about human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV&#xD;
           testing, a self-sampling test kit, and an invitation to take their own HPV sample and&#xD;
           return it to the research group for processing. Patients also receive a cervical&#xD;
           screening survey. Patients who attend for further investigation following a positive HPV&#xD;
           result go to St. Mary's Hospital Colposcopy Unit, Paddington. During this visit cervical&#xD;
           smear tests are performed and women are offered immediate colposcopy so that they would&#xD;
           not need to return for colposcopic examination if their smear test is abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is peer reviewed and funded or endorsed by cancer research UK.&#xD;
