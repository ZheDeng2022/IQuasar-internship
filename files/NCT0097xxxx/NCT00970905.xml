  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe nausea and/or vomiting in patients receiving radiotherapy to the upper abdomen is&#xD;
      common despite having received pre-medication with ondansetron, a standard preventive&#xD;
      treatment. This study aims to reduce the incidence of significant nausea and/or vomiting with&#xD;
      the addition of the NK1-antagonist aprepitant to standard ondansetron treatment. This study&#xD;
      will also assess the safety and tolerability of prolonged administration of aprepitant over&#xD;
      the 4 to 6 week period of radiation treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any patient with a diagnosis of malignancy localized to the upper abdomen and&#xD;
             requiring chemoradiation or radiation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Receiving standard-fractionation radiation therapy (&gt; 40 Gy) 3D-conformal radiation&#xD;
             therapy or IMRT to a field involving the upper abdomen, either alone or combined with&#xD;
             radiosensitizing 5FU, capecitabine, or gemcitabine permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age &gt; 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Life expectancy &gt;3 months&#xD;
&#xD;

             Classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception such&#xD;
             as abstinence or effective barrier and/or non-hormonal contraception for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate organ reserve to include: Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1500/mcl , Hemoglobin ≥&#xD;
             8.0 g/dl, platelet count ≥ 100,000/mcl, creatinine ≤ 2.0, AST &amp; ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Baseline ECG showing QTc value ≤ 480 millisecond&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Use of any other concomitant chemotherapy agent concurrently with radiation therapy&#xD;
             aside from capecitabine, gemcitabine, or 5-fluorouracil (none of these agents are CYP&#xD;
             3A4 substrates).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Baseline vomiting is not controlled: Patients who have vomited or have nausea&#xD;
             requiring antiemetic treatment within 24 hours prior to initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Scheduled to receive treatment within 24 hours prior to day one or during the study&#xD;
             periods with other potential or known antiemetic agents including but not limited to&#xD;
             serotonin antagonists aside from ondansetron per study protocol, phenothiazines,&#xD;
             butyrophenones, substituted benzamides, antihistamines, and cannabinoids. Chronically&#xD;
             used benzodiazepines may be continued as a single nightly dose for sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any steroid use except topical steroids. Patients need to be off systemic steroid&#xD;
             treatment for 7 days prior to start of chemoradiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled CNS tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Other physical causes for nausea or vomiting (such as bowel obstruction) not related&#xD;
             to chemoradiation administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Hypersensitivity to either of the study agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Planned simultaneous administration of any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant or nursing women&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients taking other CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors would be required to discontinue&#xD;
             their use for at least 7 days prior to initiation of chemoradiation therapy. Examples&#xD;
             of CYP3A4 inducers include aminoglutethimide, carbamazepine, nafcillin, nevirapine,&#xD;
             phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. Johns Wort. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors&#xD;
             include azole antifungals, clarithromycin, diclofenac, doxycycline, erythromycin,&#xD;
             imatinib, isoniazid, nefazodone, nicardipine, propofol, protease inhibitors,&#xD;
             quinidine, telithromycin, and verapamil.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. CYP3A4 substrates are not contraindicated. However, patients taking CYP3A4 substrates&#xD;
             should be cautioned to consult with their physician to minimize their use, if&#xD;
             possible. Example substrates include benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers,&#xD;
             ranolazine, ergot derivatives, mirtazapine, nateglinide, tacrolimus, and venlafaxine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Concomitant use of pimozide, terfenadine, cisapride, and astemizole is contraindicated&#xD;
             per the Emend™ [10] product circular as dose-dependent inhibition of CYP 3A4 by&#xD;
             aprepitant could result in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs, potentially&#xD;
             causing serious and life-threatening reactions. Patients taking these medications&#xD;
             ineligible to participate in this study unless they are discontinued for at least 7&#xD;
             days prior to start of aprepitant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Warfarin: Aprepitant may increase warfarin metabolism and the INR may be decreased.&#xD;
             Twice weekly monitoring of INR recommended in the first 2-week period of radiation&#xD;
             followed by weekly monitoring in subsequent weeks until discontinuation of aprepitant.&#xD;
             Twice weekly monitoring is again recommended after aprepitant discontinuation until&#xD;
             INR has stabilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Contraceptives (estrogens and progestins): Aprepitant may decrease the plasma levels&#xD;
             of estrogen and progestin contraceptives. Contraceptive efficacy may be reduced. A&#xD;
             nonhormonal form of contraception is necessary during treatment and for 1 month&#xD;
             following the last dose of aprepitant.&#xD;
