      This is a 2-armed randomised controlled trial comparing surgery alone with surgery plus&#xD;
      post-operative radiation therapy for patients with completely resected primary melanoma&#xD;
      showing histological features of neurotropism. Uncontrolled studies suggest that this form of&#xD;
      primary melanoma has a high risk of local recurrence and that postoperative radiation therapy&#xD;
      may substantially reduce that risk. Patients who are eligible on the basis of the pathology&#xD;
      of the excised melanoma will be offered the opportunity to take part in the trial. Those&#xD;
      randomised to receive radiation therapy will be treated with a simple technique encompassing&#xD;
      the surgical bed plus a margin. Radiation will commence within 3 months of surgery (maximum&#xD;
      of 14 weeks from surgery to start of radiotherapy).&#xD;

      Background Melanoma is a serious and common malignancy in Australia. It is the third most&#xD;
      common cancer in Australia and approximately 1000 Australians will die of the disease each&#xD;
      year.At least a quarter of these will be patients under the age of 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotropism, defined as invasion by melanoma of peripheral neural tissue, is a feature of&#xD;
      the disease that may predispose towards a high local recurrence rate. Local recurrence,&#xD;
      particularly in the head and neck region often requires more extensive, potentially morbid&#xD;
      surgery. Neurotropism is especially likely to occur in desmoplastic melanoma where it may be&#xD;
      as high as 40 - 60%.6-8 Desmoplastic melanoma tends to occur in a slightly older age group&#xD;
      than conventional types of melanoma and most often occurs in the head and neck region in&#xD;
      individuals with chronic sun damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of localised neurotropic melanoma has traditionally been with surgery.&#xD;
      Recommendations are that surgical margins should be at least 2 cm.There are some patients&#xD;
      where this margin is not achievable due to the location of the tumour close to important&#xD;
      anatomical structures. Uncontrolled studies suggest that radiation therapy may reduce the&#xD;
      risk of local recurrence in those patients although there are no randomised trials to confirm&#xD;
      this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy has been shown in a randomised trial led from&#xD;
      Australia, to reduce regional recurrence rates in nodal melanoma.There are no previously&#xD;
      conducted randomised controlled trials addressing a similar question for neurotropic&#xD;
      melanoma. The only reports are in relation to retrospective reviews that suggest a benefit&#xD;
      for postoperative radiation therapy after surgery. It is unlikely that this trial will be&#xD;
      done outside of Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Radiation therapy after surgery for neurotropic melanoma improves local control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This can be achieved without a significant increase in treatment morbidity or reduction&#xD;
           in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To determine, in patients who have undergone surgery with curative intent for neurotropic&#xD;
      melanoma, whether there is a difference in the rate and timing of local (in field) recurrence&#xD;
      between patients who are treated with post-operative radiation therapy and those that are&#xD;
      initially observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine, in these patients, whether there is a difference in progression-free&#xD;
           survival, patterns of relapse and overall survival between patients treated with surgery&#xD;
           alone and those treated by surgery plus adjuvant radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine, in these patients, whether there is a difference in morbidity and quality&#xD;
           of life between patients treated with surgery alone and those treated with surgery plus&#xD;
           adjuvant radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This is a 2-armed randomised controlled trial comparing surgery alone with&#xD;
      surgery plus post-operative radiation therapy for patients with completely resected primary&#xD;
      melanoma showing histological features of neurotropism. Patients who are eligible on the&#xD;
      basis of the pathology of the completely excised melanoma will be offered the opportunity to&#xD;
      take part in the trial. Those randomised to receive radiation therapy will be treated with a&#xD;
      simple technique encompassing the surgical bed plus a margin within 3 months of surgery. The&#xD;
      same regimen which was used in the nodal trial will be used in this study. Patients in the&#xD;
      observation arm who subsequently recur in field may be offered further surgery followed by&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Methods Patients will be randomised in the ratio of 1:1 between the two arms,&#xD;
      radiation therapy and no radiation therapy. Allocation to the treatment arm will be&#xD;
      stratified by institution and tumour site (head or neck) using randomly permuted blocks.&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible on the basis of their pathology of excised melanoma will be offered&#xD;
      the opportunity to take part in the trial. While males and females will both be considered&#xD;
      equally for participation on the trial, there is no way of knowing if the ratio will be 1:1.&#xD;
