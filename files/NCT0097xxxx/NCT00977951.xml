      The purpose of this study is to further determine the safety and toleration of intradermal&#xD;
      avotermin (Juvista), confirm accelerated healing and investigate genomic expression profiles&#xD;

      Subjects were allocated to two groups. Group 1 had scheduled visits on Day 0, 1, 3 and 4&#xD;
      while group 2 were scheduled for Day 0, 1, 5 and 6. Follow-up post-trial safety assessments&#xD;
      were made on Day 10-20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0 each subject received a total of four 1cm incision wounds; two each to the upper,&#xD;
      inner aspect of each arm. Two areas for incision were marked out on the inner aspect of each&#xD;
      upper arm and anaesthetised before intradermal injection of Juvista or placebo. One incision&#xD;
      site on each arm received a dose of 50ng/100μl Juvista and the other incision site received&#xD;
      Placebo. Following injection a full thickness 1cm incision was made along the marked site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 all subjects were re-injected with the same dose of Juvista or placebo, 100μl to&#xD;
      each wound margin (200μl per wound site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 3 subjects in Group 1 were re-dosed with 200μl Juvista or Placebo per site (100μl per&#xD;
      linear cm approximated wound margin) in Arm 1. These sites were then excised with an&#xD;
      elliptical excision. On Day 4 the same subjects received another dose of Juvista or placebo&#xD;
      as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in group 2 received the same treatment to their Arm 1 as those in group 1, except on&#xD;
      Day 5 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All wounds were monitored and photographed at two monthly intervals over the course of 6&#xD;
      months. At month 6, all incision sites on Arm 2 for both groups were excised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All excised wounds were snap frozen for genomic analysis.&#xD;
