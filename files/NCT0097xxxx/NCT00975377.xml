    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether hair clipping is non-inferior to no hair&#xD;
      removal in preventing superficial, deep, and organ space surgical site infections (SSI) in&#xD;
      patients undergoing various general surgical procedures, evaluated after surgery by an&#xD;
      assessor blinded to treatment allocation. Additional goals include evaluating wound&#xD;
      complications that arise in patients that have hair clipped and in patients that do not have&#xD;
      hair removed and determining the impact of clipping versus no hair removal and SSI versus no&#xD;
      SSI on length of hospital stay.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Public health organizations, third party payers, consumer watchdog groups, health care&#xD;
      quality organizations, and patients are increasingly scrutinizing patient safety in&#xD;
      hospitals. Surgical site infection (SSI) rates are one of the key quality measures by which&#xD;
      hospitals are evaluated. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines provide specific&#xD;
      recommendations, weighted by evidence, to prevent SSI. These include the following category&#xD;
      1A recommendations (Strongly recommended for implementation and supported by well-designed&#xD;
      experimental, clinical, or epidemiological studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not remove hair preoperatively unless the hair at or around the incision site will&#xD;
           interfere with the operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If hair is removed, remove immediately before the operation, preferably with electric&#xD;
           clippers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a recent systematic review of randomized clinical trials concluded there was no&#xD;
      difference in SSI among patients that had hair removed prior to surgery and those that did&#xD;
      not. Furthermore, trials involving hair removal were largely underpowered and of marginal&#xD;
      quality. If hair is going to be removed, previous studies have shown hair removal with&#xD;
      clippers or depilatory creams to result in fewer SSI than shaving with a razor. However, the&#xD;
      need for trials comparing SSI rates with and without hair removal was stressed in the recent&#xD;
      systematic review. No prospective, randomized clinical trial evaluating no hair removal vs.&#xD;
      hair removal by clipping, the two hair removing modalities preferred by CDC SSI prevention&#xD;
      guidelines, has ever been reported. This study aims to assess whether hair removal via&#xD;
      clipping is non-inferior to no hair removal in a cohort of patients undergoing general&#xD;
      surgical procedures at a community hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-inferiority study design will be used based upon the following rationale. CDC&#xD;
      guidelines recommend not removing hair preoperatively unless the hair will interfere with the&#xD;
      operation. However, there is no published evidence that clipping hair results in more SSI&#xD;
      than no hair removal. Clipping hair is often preferred from a surgical perspective. This may&#xD;
      be because of historical practice patterns, personal comfort level, and the either real or&#xD;
      perceived interference of unremoved hair with performing the operation. Therefore, assessing&#xD;
      whether clipping is non-inferior to no hair removal will provide helpful information&#xD;
      regarding the appropriateness of the current CDC recommendation to not remove hair&#xD;
      preoperatively unless the hair will interfere with the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for enrollment after a decision has been made for elective&#xD;
      (non-emergent) operative intervention. Patients will undergo our institution's current&#xD;
      preoperative procedural standard of care. Patients will be specifically instructed to not&#xD;
      shave themselves prior to the procedure. The day of the procedure patients will undergo our&#xD;
      institution's standard preoperative skin preparation, which currently includes povidone based&#xD;
      skin antiseptic. Preoperative antibiotics will be administered according to our institutional&#xD;
      standards of care for their particular operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be assigned the day of surgery in the preoperative area. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to either undergo clipping or no hair removal. Enrolled patients will then&#xD;
      undergo the type of hair removal appropriate for their study arm. Clipping patients will&#xD;
      undergo hair removal on the day of surgery by a member of the preoperative nursing staff,&#xD;
      immediately prior to the scheduled operation. Any patient that undergoes unanticipated hair&#xD;
      removal, (either additional hair removal in patients that were clipped or any hair removal in&#xD;
      patients that were not clipped) will be noted as a protocol deviation and the event recorded.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo their surgical procedure according to standard surgical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be scheduled for a follow-up wound assessment with a trained study nurse. This&#xD;
      assessment will take place by an independent assessor whom is blinded (as best able given&#xD;
      study interventions) to the study group the patient was in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, if patients are seen for wound problems by their surgeon, primary physicians,&#xD;
      or other physicians we will attempt to have them evaluated by one of the trained nurses at&#xD;
      that visit as well. If patients do not keep their follow-up appointment, they will be called&#xD;
      and asked a standardized set of questions related to the wound. Finally, in the event&#xD;
      patients are seen for wound problems at other facilities, or in other departments (i.e.&#xD;
      urgent care, emergency room, etc), they will be encouraged to make a follow-up appointment&#xD;
      within a few days to be reassessed, at which time the study nurse can assess their status as&#xD;
      well. The patients' electronic medical records will be updated to reflect their study&#xD;
      involvement, and to alert providers to contact the study coordinator with wound related&#xD;
      questions if seen in another department.&#xD;
