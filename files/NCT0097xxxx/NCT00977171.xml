  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A subset of patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome exhibit symptoms of neurally&#xD;
      mediated hypotension. While the underlying pathophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is not&#xD;
      precisely understood, a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system is thought to play a role&#xD;
      in this subset of patients. In several small studies, subjects within this subset have noted&#xD;
      improvement in their chronic fatigue symptoms when treated for their neurally mediated&#xD;
      hypotension. As droxidopa acts on the autonomic nervous system and has been shown to&#xD;
      ameliorate symptoms of neurally mediated hypotension, it is hypothesized that droxidopa could&#xD;
      aid in the treatment of chronic fatigue symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurally mediated hypotension has been associated with patients suffering from chronic&#xD;
      fatigue syndrome. Droxidopa meanwhile has been approved in Japan for the treatment of the&#xD;
      symptoms of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. As such, it is hypothesized that regulating&#xD;
      the autonomic nervous system in patients with Chronic fatigue syndrome may prove to be&#xD;
      clinically beneficial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-center, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      droxidopa in subjects with chronic fatigue syndrome. The study will enroll enough subjects to&#xD;
      allow 10 to be placed in the 12 week open label treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of an initial screening period (up to 7 days) to confirm eligibility&#xD;
      followed by an up to 2 week dose titration period, a 12 week treatment period and a 30 day&#xD;
      follow up period to account for any new or on-going AEs. During the screening visit the&#xD;
      following assessments will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demography;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs (BP, HR, weight)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stand Test (measurement of BP and heart rate in the supine position (head and torso&#xD;
           elevated at approximately 30° from horizontal) 10, 5, immediately before and 1, 5 and 10&#xD;
           minutes after standing);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tilt Table Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for hematology and biochemistry;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample for urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for females of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant medication review o Subjects taking ephedrine or midodrine will stop taking&#xD;
           these drugs for at least 7 days before the baseline assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days of successful screening, the following baseline assessments will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion/Exclusion review;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standing test (measurement of BP and heart rate 10, 5, immediately before and 1, 5 and&#xD;
           10 minutes after standing);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs (BP, HR, and weight);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine/serum pregnancy test for WOCP;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief Pain Inventory (BPI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following successful completion of screening and baseline procedures, subjects will enter the&#xD;
      dose titration period. Subjects will be titrated upwards by 100 mg TID, preferably on&#xD;
      consecutive days but definitely within 14 days of entry, until one of the following 3&#xD;
      criteria for ceasing dose escalation is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The subject has a sustained SBP of greater than 140 mmHg or DBP of greater than 90 mmHg&#xD;
           after 1, 5 or 10 minutes of standing, OR a sustained SBP greater than 150 mmHg or DBP&#xD;
           greater than 100 mmHg measured in the supine position (head and torso elevated at&#xD;
           approximately 30° from horizontal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The subject is unable to tolerate side effects believed to be related to the study&#xD;
           medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The subject reaches the maximum dose of 600 mg TID droxidopa. If a subject meets&#xD;
           criteria 1 they will proceed directly to the treatment period at the previous lower&#xD;
           dose. Subjects meeting criteria 2 will also proceed directly to the treatment period at&#xD;
           the previous lower dose. Subjects meeting criteria 3 will enter immediately into the&#xD;
           treatment period at 600 mg TID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that meet criteria 1 or 2 at the initial 100 mg TID dose will be considered baseline&#xD;
      failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, the investigator can determine whether to modify the subject's dose. This&#xD;
      determination will be based on the subject's tolerability of droxidopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon successful completion of the dose titration, subjects will begin a 12 week treatment&#xD;
      period. Subjects will return to the clinic every 4 weeks (+/- 3 days) for efficacy, safety&#xD;
      and compliance check. A follow-up call will occur 30 days after completion or removal of the&#xD;
      trial to record any new or on-going AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      droxidopa&#xD;
&#xD;
      droxidopa [also, known as L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine, L-threo-DOPS, or L-DOPS] is the&#xD;
      International non-proprietary name (INN) for a synthetic amino acid precursor of&#xD;
      norepinephrine (NE), which was originally developed by Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co., Limited,&#xD;
      Japan. It has been approved for use in Japan since 1989.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Droxidopa has been shown to improve symptoms of orthostatic hypotension that result from a&#xD;
      variety of conditions including Shy Drager syndrome (Multiple System Atrophy), Pure Autonomic&#xD;
      Failure, and Parkinson's disease. There are four stereoisomers of DOPS; however, only the&#xD;
      L-threo-enantiomer (droxidopa) is biologically active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanism of action of droxidopa in the treatment of symptomatic NOH has not been&#xD;
      precisely defined; however, its NE replenishing properties with concomitant recovery of&#xD;
      decreased noradrenergic activity are considered to be of major importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Droxidopa has been marketed in Japan since 1989. Data from clinical studies and&#xD;
      post-marketing surveillance programs conducted in Japan show that the most commonly reported&#xD;
      adverse drug reactions with droxidopa are increased blood pressure, nausea, and headache. In&#xD;
      clinical studies, the prevalence and severity of droxidopa adverse effects appear to be&#xD;
      similar to those reported by the placebo control arm.&#xD;

             considerably among different age groups and populations. No&quot;normal&quot; or &quot;average&quot; range&#xD;
             of values can be suggested in a fashion that is meaningful. The BMI range of 45 or&#xD;
             greater was selected because it clearly falls within the range of severe obesity.]&#xD;
