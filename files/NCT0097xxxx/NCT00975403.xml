  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a growing cause of death, disability and&#xD;
      health care costs in Canada. Nevertheless, COPD remains largely under-diagnosed and&#xD;
      under-treated, particularly in its early stages. Patients with mild COPD have variable&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms and often go unrecognized by their caregivers. Recent studies indicate&#xD;
      that even smokers with near normal breathing test results can have extensive small airway&#xD;
      disease/dysfunction at rest, which becomes more pronounced during the stress of exercise thus&#xD;
      leading to unpleasant breathing difficulty. This study seeks to better understand the nature&#xD;
      and causes of breathing discomfort and activity limitation in a group of patients with mild&#xD;
      COPD. The investigators will compare detailed tests of small airway function and conduct an&#xD;
      evaluation of several key physiological parameters during the stress of exercise in patients&#xD;
      with mild COPD and in healthy, age-matched, non-smoking control subjects. The investigators&#xD;
      will also compare detailed physiological responses to exercise under conditions of chemical&#xD;
      loading and mechanical unloading of the respiratory system in patients with mild COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be the first to systematically test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      pathophysiological abnormalities in ventilatory demand, pulmonary gas exchange, small airway&#xD;
      function, dynamic ventilatory mechanics and respiratory muscle function contribute&#xD;
      significantly to exertional dyspnea and activity-limitation in patients with mild COPD. This&#xD;
      study will be the first to determine if these abnormalities can be manipulated.&#xD;
