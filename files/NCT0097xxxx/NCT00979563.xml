  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      OratecanTM. Eligible subjects of this study are patients with histologically or cytologically&#xD;
      confirmed malignant solid tumor refractory to standard therapy or for which no established&#xD;
      therapy exists at the time of study participation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Besides the main objective, there are 3 other objectives as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of OratecanTM&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of HM30181A, irinotecan and its metabolites (SN-38&#xD;
           and SN-38G) following oral administration of OratecanTM&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate anticancer activity of OratecanTM in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
           malignancies Groups of 3 patients per cohort or dose level will be treated with&#xD;
           escalating doses of irinotecan in combination with a fixed 60mg dose of HM30181A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 0/3 patients at any dose level experience a DLT, the dose of irinotecan will be escalated&#xD;
      by 10 mg/m2 in the next dose level. If 1/3 patients at any dose level experience a DLT, the&#xD;
      cohort will be expanded by 3 additional patients to 6 patients. If no additional patients&#xD;
      develop DLT, the dose of irinotecan will again be escalated in the next cohort of 3 patients.&#xD;
      If 2/3 or 2/6 patients develop DLT, then dose escalation will cease, and the previous dose&#xD;
      will be declared the MTD.&#xD;
