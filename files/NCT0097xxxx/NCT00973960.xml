      The main objective of the study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the EndoBarrier&#xD;
      Flow Restrictor in the glycemic control of diabetes in subjects with Type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is an assessment of glycemic control at week 24 or last&#xD;
      assessment measured via HbA1c.&#xD;
