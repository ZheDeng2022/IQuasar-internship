      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, approximately 400 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV). Chronic HBV infection increases the risk of developing cirrhosis, hepatic&#xD;
      decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The risk of developing hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma is highest in HBeAg positive patients with high HBV DNA levels, but still the&#xD;
      relative risk remains 10 for HBeAg negative patients. Furthermore it has been shown that when&#xD;
      HBsAg is cleared before cirrhosis has developed, the prognosis is excellent. Recently the&#xD;
      investigators have shown that HBeAg negative patients with high HBV-DNA load and low baseline&#xD;
      HBsAg levels had a significantly higher HBsAg clearance (positive predictive value of 85%)&#xD;
      after combination therapy with peginterferon alfa2a (Peg-IFN) and adefovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these results, a trial was designed to investigate whether combination of a&#xD;
      nucleos(t)ide analogue combined with PegIFN, could also provoke a high rate of HBsAg&#xD;
      clearance in chronic hepatitis B patients with low (HBV DNA &lt;20,000 IU/mL) viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a three arm open-label prospective randomized controlled trial. 150 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study after assessment of eligibility. All patients must have documented&#xD;
      HBsAg positivity for longer than 6 months, HBeAg negativity, anti-HBe positivity, HBV DNA &lt;&#xD;
      20,000 IU/mL and ALT &lt; 5 * upper limit of normal. Patients with a Child Pugh class B or C&#xD;
      will be excluded. Group 1 will consist of patients treated with Peg-IFN and adefovir, group 2&#xD;
      will consist of patients treated with Peg-IFN and tenofovir and group 3 will consist of&#xD;
      untreated controls. Patients in group 1 and 2 will receive medication for the period of one&#xD;
      year. For enrolment into the study a liverbiopsy at time of enrolment is compulsory and is&#xD;
      advisable at end of treatment (week 48).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population will consist of 150 patients chronically infected with&#xD;
      hepatitis B virus with low viral load and HBeAg negativity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate what proportion of HBeAg negative, inactive carriers&#xD;
      of the hepatitis B virus with low (&lt; 20,000 IU/mL) load will lose HBsAg when treated with&#xD;
      nucleot(s)ide analogue/Peg-IFN combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators hypothesize that both treatment with peg-interferon and ADF&#xD;
      or Peg-IFN and TDF in HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B patients with low HBV DNA viral load&#xD;
      will induce a high rate of HBsAg loss, comparable to that in patients with high viral load&#xD;
      after treatment with ADF and Peg-IFN.&#xD;
