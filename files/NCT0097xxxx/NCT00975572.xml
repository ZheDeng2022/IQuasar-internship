      The primary safety objective of this study is to assess the safety of split- virion&#xD;
      inactivated H1N1 vaccine with and without adjuvant when administered at the 7.5,15 or 30 mcg&#xD;
      dose. The primary immunogenicity objective is to assess the antibody response following each&#xD;
      dose of split- virion inactivated A(H1N1) vaccine with and without adjuvant. Participants&#xD;
      will include up to 2200 healthy persons age 3 and older who have no history of novel&#xD;
      influenza H1N1 2009 infection or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination. This is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, Phase II study in healthy males and non-pregnant females, aged 3 years and&#xD;
      older. Subjects will be stratified by elders (equal to or more than 61 years), adults (18-60&#xD;
      years), adolescents (12-17 years) and children (3-11 years), elders and adolescents will be&#xD;
      randomized into 5 dose groups (adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 7.5,15 or 30 mcg per dose or&#xD;
      non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 15 or 30 mcg per dose), children will be randomized into 4&#xD;
      dose groups (adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 7.5 or 15 mcg per dose or non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine&#xD;
      of 15 or 30 mcg per dose), adults will be randomized into 6 dose groups (adjuvanted H1N1&#xD;
      vaccine of 7.5,15 or 30 mcg per dose or non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 15 or 30 mcg per dose&#xD;
      or placebo), 110 subjects per dose and age stratum will be to receive intramuscular influenza&#xD;
      H1N1 vaccine. The H1N1 vaccine will be administered at Day 0 and Day 21. Following&#xD;
      immunization, safety will be measured by assessment of adverse events through 21 days&#xD;
      following the last vaccination (Day 42 for those receiving both doses), serious adverse&#xD;
      events and new-onset chronic medical conditions through 6 months post the final vaccination&#xD;
      (Day 180 after second vaccination), and reactogenicity to the vaccine for 8 days (Day 0-7)&#xD;
      following each vaccination. Immunogenicity testing will be hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI)&#xD;
      on serum obtained on the day 21 of each vaccination (prior to vaccination), on Day 21 after&#xD;
      first vaccination, and 21 days following the second vaccination (Day 42).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus was identified as a significant cause&#xD;
      of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. It rapidly spread to many&#xD;
      countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a&#xD;
      pandemic on June 11, 2009. Data from several cohorts in different age groups that received&#xD;
      licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines suggest that these vaccines are unlikely to&#xD;
      provide protection against the new virus. In addition, adults are more likely to have&#xD;
      measurable levels of serum hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) or neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      than are children. These data indicate the need to develop vaccines against the new H1N1&#xD;
      strain and suggest that different vaccine strategies (e.g., number of doses, need for&#xD;
      adjuvant) may be appropriate for persons in different age groups. The primary safety&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the safety of split- virion inactivated H1N1 vaccine&#xD;
      with and without adjuvant when administered at the 7.5,15 or 30 mcg dose. The primary&#xD;
      immunogenicity objective is to assess the antibody response following each dose of split-&#xD;
      virion inactivated A(H1N1) vaccine with and without adjuvant,. Participants will include up&#xD;
      to 2200 healthy persons age 3 and older who have no history of novel influenza H1N1 2009&#xD;
      infection or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination. This is a randomized, double-blinded,&#xD;
      Phase II study in healthy males and non-pregnant females, aged 3 years and older. This study&#xD;
      is designed to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an inactivated&#xD;
      influenza H1N1 virus vaccine at different dose levels of split- virion inactivated H1N1&#xD;
      vaccine with or without adjuvant or placebo in 4 aged groups. Subjects will be stratified by&#xD;
      elders (equal to or more than 61 years), adults (18-60 years), adolescents (12-17 years) and&#xD;
      children (3-11 years), elders and adolescents will be randomized into 5 dose&#xD;
      groups(adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 7.5,15 or 30 mcg per dose or non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of&#xD;
      15 or 30 mcg per dose ) , children will be randomized into 4 dose groups(adjuvanted H1N1&#xD;
      vaccine of 7.5 or 15 mcg per dose or non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 15 or 30 mcg per dose ),&#xD;
      adults will be randomized into 6 dose groups(adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 7.5,15 or 30 mcg per&#xD;
      dose or non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine of 15 or 30 mcg per dose or placebo ), 110 subjects per&#xD;
      dose and age stratum will be to receive intramuscular influenza H1N1 vaccine . The H1N1&#xD;
      vaccine will be administered at Day 0 and Day 21. Following immunization, safety will be&#xD;
      measured by assessment of adverse events through 21 days following the last vaccination (Day&#xD;
      42 for those receiving both doses), serious adverse events and new-onset chronic medical&#xD;
      conditions through 6 months post the final vaccination (Day 180 after second vaccination),&#xD;
      and reactogenicity to the vaccine for 8 days (Day 0-7) following each vaccination.&#xD;
      Immunogenicity testing will be HAI on serum obtained on the day 21 of each vaccination (prior&#xD;
      to vaccination), on Day 21 after first vaccination, and 21 days following the second&#xD;
      vaccination (Day 42).&#xD;
