      ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well recognized that excess dietary salt intake plays a major role in the development&#xD;
      of hypertension. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is associated with excess salt and water&#xD;
      retention (excess volume) which is associated with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary salt restriction will improve volume status in subjects with CKD stages 3-4 as&#xD;
      assessed by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary salt restriction will result in improved blood pressure control in patients with CKD&#xD;
      stages 3-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary salt restriction will decrease albuminuria in patients with CKD stages 3-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Trial Design: This randomized crossover pilot study is designed to assess the&#xD;
      effect of salt restriction on volume status in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to a treatment order: (1) 4 weeks of salt restriction of &lt;85 mmol&#xD;
      sodium per day, a 2 week washout period, and 4 weeks of usual salt diet, OR (2) 4 weeks of&#xD;
      usual diet, 2 weeks washout, and 4 weeks of salt restriction. Patients will receive dietary&#xD;
      counseling in person at each study visit and at weekly intervals by phone calls from study&#xD;
      dieticians. At weeks 0, 4, 6 and 10, patients will undergo assessments for (i) physical&#xD;
      examination with assessments for weight, blood pressure, pulse, anthropometrics and a&#xD;
      standardized clinical assessment of volume status. (ii) volume status using bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance analysis (BIA) (iii) 24-hour urine testing for, albumin, creatinine and aldosterone&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks throughout the study, a 24-hour urine sodium will be measured for compliance,&#xD;
      and serum electrolytes will be assessed for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: BIA measurements in the low salt group will be compared with the regular diet&#xD;
      group using the standard linear model analysis for 2x2 crossover trials. Additionally,&#xD;
      24-hour ambulatory and static blood pressure and 24-hour urine aldosterone levels will be&#xD;
      compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future Implications: A significant reduction in the degree of volume expansion (as assessed&#xD;
      by BIA) and blood pressure as a result of a salt restricted diet would have implications for&#xD;
      renal and cardiovascular protection and would warrant confirmation by a larger randomized&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
