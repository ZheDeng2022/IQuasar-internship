    <textblock>
      Recent evidences showed beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular Omega-3 fatty acid consumption reduces cardiovascular mortality, ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease and stroke mortality. There is probably no single mechanism of action that explains&#xD;
      this beneficial effect; but possible mechanisms include reduce susceptibility of the heart to&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmia, antithrombogenic effect, reduce triglyceride level, promotion of&#xD;
      nitric oxide-induced endothelial relaxation, and retard growth of atherosclerotic plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of satins and omega3 was proved to be better the any of the drugs alone in&#xD;
      several studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate several possible mechanisms that may explain the&#xD;
      add on beneficial effect of omega-3 in hypercholesterolemic patients already treated with&#xD;
      satins.&#xD;

      Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the western world. HMG-co A Reductase&#xD;
      (statins) stands in the first line of treatment of cardiovascular disease because of their&#xD;
      direct effect on LDL and their pleotrophic effect (mainly anti-inflammatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidences showed beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular Omega-3 fatty acid consumption reduces cardiovascular mortality , , ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease and stroke mortality. There is probably no single mechanism of action that explains&#xD;
      this beneficial effect; but possible mechanisms include reduce susceptibility of the heart to&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmia, antithrombogenic effect , reduce triglyceride level , promotion of&#xD;
      nitric oxide-induced endothelial relaxation , , and retard growth of atherosclerotic plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins have a proven survival benefit in patients with hypercholesterolemia by preventing&#xD;
      both primary and secondary cardiovascular events . Statins also has beneficial effect on&#xD;
      lipid profile (mainly LDL and less triglycerides), they reduce plaque growth and improves&#xD;
      endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have demonstrated the additive effect of the combination of statins and omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids on lipid profile, as well as additive effect on inflammatory markers (IL-6 and&#xD;
      CRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      JELIS 3is a recent study that examined 19000 patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with&#xD;
      statins. This study demonstrated 19% reduction in coronary events under statins and omega 3&#xD;
      co-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate several possible mechanisms that may explain the&#xD;
      add on beneficial effect of omega-3 in hypercholesterolemic patients already treated with&#xD;
      satins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods 80 patients age 30-70 with known dyslipidemia treated with statins will be enrolled&#xD;
      at the research center in Asaf-Harofeh medical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will pass an interview, physical examination, lipid profile, CBC; and glucose&#xD;
      level at base line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorder, uncontrolled hypertension, LDL&gt;160,&#xD;
      uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, recent (3m) cardiovascular event, or omega-3 pretreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 3 weeks all the patients will receive placebo. After randomization 40&#xD;
      patients will receive Omega-3 (2 pills omega-950, Solgar, every day) for the next 5 months,&#xD;
      40 patients will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, after 3 weeks of placebo and after 6 weeks of omega-3 treatment, and after&#xD;
      another 3 months, all patients will come to the research center and have interview, physical&#xD;
      examination, lipid profile, including oxidized LDL. In order to learn about inflammation we&#xD;
      will measure hsCRP, we will measure Isoprostane as a marker for oxidative stress,Lp-PLA2 will&#xD;
      be measures in order to learn about plaque activity, Augmentation index will be measured to&#xD;
      learn about arterial stiffness and central hypertension, platelet aggregation tests in a new&#xD;
      method called cone and platelet analyzer will be measured. In every meeting a blood pressure&#xD;
      recorder will measure 24h blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Augmentation index:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachial blood pressure will be measured using a validated, manual oscillometric device&#xD;
      .Patients were seated and rested for 5 minutes in a quiet room, after which time blood&#xD;
      pressure will be measured over the brachial artery 3 times at 5-minute intervals. The mean of&#xD;
      the last 2 measurements was recorded as representative of brachial blood pressure. After the&#xD;
      last measurement, radial artery pressure waveforms of the same arm will be sampled over 10&#xD;
      seconds with a Millar tonometer (SPC-301, Millar Instruments) and calibrated to the average&#xD;
      blood pressure. Waveforms were then processed with dedicated software (SphygmoCor version 7,&#xD;
      AtCor). The integral system software will be used to calculate an averaged radial artery&#xD;
      waveform and to derive a corresponding central aortic pressure waveform using a previously&#xD;
      validated generalized transfer function. Aortic pressure waveforms will be subjected to&#xD;
      further analysis by the SphygmoCor software to identify the time to the peak/shoulder of the&#xD;
      first and second pressure wave components (T1, T2) during systole. The pressure at the&#xD;
      peak/shoulder of the first component will be identified as P1 height (outgoing pressure&#xD;
      wave), and the pressure difference between this point and the maximal pressure during systole&#xD;
      ( P or augmentation) will be identified as the reflected pressure wave occurring during&#xD;
      systole. Augmentation index (AIx), defined as the ratio of augmentation to central pulse&#xD;
      pressure, is expressed as a percentage: AIx=( P/PP)x100, where P is pressure and PP is pulse&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone and platelet analyser:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CPA tests platelet activation in whole blood under flow conditions. 200 µL of citrated&#xD;
      blood will be placed in polystyrene wells and circulated at a high shear rate (1875 s-1) for&#xD;
      2 minutes with a rotating Teflon cone. Wells will be washed with water, stained&#xD;
      (May-Grünwald), and analyzed with an inverted-light microscope connected to an image analysis&#xD;
      system. Results are expressed as the percentage of the well surface covered by platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isoprostane Isoprostane is a marker for oxidative stress. Isoprostane level is measured by&#xD;
      EIA (Cayman Chemical Company)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Pressure monitor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four-hour ABPM will be executed with Spacelabs 90207. The monitor was mounted on the&#xD;
      nondominant arm between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM and removed 24 hours later. Recordings were made&#xD;
      every 20 minutes between 6:00 AM and midnight and every 30 minutes between midnight and 6:00&#xD;
      AM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be classified as having normal awake BP if the corresponding value was &lt;135-mm&#xD;
      Hg systolic BP (SBP) and &lt;85-mm Hg diastolic BP (DBP). Normal sleep BP was considered &lt;120/70&#xD;
      mm Hg.20,21 The overall 24-hour normality definition was &lt;125/80 mm Hg.22 The normal dip was&#xD;
      defined separately for SBP and DBP as 10% reduction in BP during sleep compared with the&#xD;
      awake period.23 Nondipping was defined as a decrease &lt;10% but 0%. Dipping beyond 20% was&#xD;
      considered &quot;extreme,&quot; and sleep-related BP &quot;rising&quot; denoted negative dipping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAC The PLAC Test is a blood test that measures the level of Lp-PLA2, an enzyme highly&#xD;
      specific to vascular inflammation and implicated in the formation of rupture-prone plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PLAC Test is the only blood test cleared by the FDA to aid in assessing risk of both&#xD;
      coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke associated with atherosclerosis.&#xD;
