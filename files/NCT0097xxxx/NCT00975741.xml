    <textblock>
      Mometasone furoate (MF) is a new potent synthetic corticosteroid. Internationally, MF is&#xD;
      administered by a breath-actuated DPI and supplied in multidose devices. Capsules to be&#xD;
      administered through a monodose device that would offer an alternative to MF DPI multidose&#xD;
      treatment in terms of cost-effectiveness were developed in Brazil. The aim of the present&#xD;
      non-inferiority clinical study was to evaluate both devices in terms of efficacy and safety.&#xD;

      Background: Internationally, MF is administered by a breath-actuated DPI and supplied in&#xD;
      multidose devices. Capsules to be administered through a monodose device that would offer an&#xD;
      alternative to MF DPI multidose treatment in terms of cost-effectiveness were developed in&#xD;
      Brazil. Results of laboratory analysis for respirable fraction, content uniformity of emitted&#xD;
      dose and of the bulk powder and for percentage of particles &lt; 1 micra of both MF 200 µg and&#xD;
      MF 400 µg capsules have indicated their equivalent performance in comparison to MF DPI&#xD;
      multidose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of the present non-inferiority clinical study was to evaluate both devices in&#xD;
      terms of efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Ninety-seven adult patients with moderate persistent asthma were randomized in two&#xD;
      groups to receive for 60 days a dose of 400 µg of DPI MF once daily (at evening) using&#xD;
      multidose or monodose device. Follow-up visits were scheduled at Days 7, 14, 28, 42 and 56.&#xD;
      Efficacy was assessed by means of pulmonary function tests (spirometry - FEV1 and PEFR) at&#xD;
      each visit. In addition, subjects have recorded twice daily PEFR, symptom scores and use of&#xD;
      rescue medication throughout the study. Response to therapy was also assessed. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations included monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
      (plasma cortisol concentrations were assessed at enrollment and repeated after 60 days of MF&#xD;
      treatment; cortrosyn test was performed at the enrollment and after 60 days of MF treatment),&#xD;
      and physical examination.&#xD;
