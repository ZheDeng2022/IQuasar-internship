      This study is intended to look at the safety and efficacy of the use of autologous bone&#xD;
      marrow derived stem cell transplant in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, still at its best can only be controlled&#xD;
      by medical or surgical treatment. For more than two decades various groups have tried using&#xD;
      modified cell transplants for curing this disease. Earlier results with use of fetal&#xD;
      mesencephalic cell transplant were encouraging, but this had to be discontinued due to severe&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current interest, in the use of Mesenchymal stem cells as a pluripotent cell for developing&#xD;
      neural cells has been the background for this study. Reliance Life sciences had found&#xD;
      encouraging results with the use of human MSCs in Rat model of PD. Based on this and other&#xD;
      data, Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre has initiated a pilot study to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of Autologous MSCs in treating advanced PD. This cells will be harvested from bone&#xD;
      marrow, processed at RLS laboratory and transplanted by stereotactic techniques into the&#xD;
      striatum of the patient.&#xD;
