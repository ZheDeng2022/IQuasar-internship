    <textblock>
      Two consecutive cohorts of subjects were each treated with the CoStar stent loaded with a&#xD;
      different paclitaxel dose regimen. The first 145 subjects (Arm I), enrolled between 20&#xD;
      January 2004 and 26 May 2004, were treated with 10 µg paclitaxel and the subsequent 137&#xD;
      subjects (Arm II), enrolled between 15 December 2004 and 9 March 2005, were treated with 30&#xD;
      µg paclitaxel. Both dose formulations eluted over 30 days (in-vitro).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in both arms completed clinical follow-up at 1, 6 and 12 months post-index&#xD;
      procedure, with angiographic follow-up at 6 months as outlined in the original study&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on results from previous studies and the initial EuroSTAR Trial results, Conor&#xD;
      Medsystems decided to pursue the dosage used in Arm I, 10 μg/30 days, as the commercial dose&#xD;
      formulation for the CoStar® stent. The EuroSTAR Trial addendum was proposed for the purpose&#xD;
      of evaluating the long-term clinical outcomes of the CoStar stent.&#xD;

      The EuroSTAR Trial (European Cobalt STent with Antiproliferative for Restenosis Trial) is a&#xD;
      prospective, multi-center, two-arm study to evaluate the safety and performance of the&#xD;
      CoStar® stent for the treatment of symptomatic ischemic heart disease attributable to&#xD;
      stenotic de novo lesions of the native coronary arteries that are amenable to treatment by&#xD;
      percutaneous stenting.&#xD;
