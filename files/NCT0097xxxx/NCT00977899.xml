      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malaria, a disease transmitted by mosquitoes, affects millions of people with the&#xD;
           highest frequency, morbidity, and mortality in infants and young children. Plasmodium&#xD;
           falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, the most common and severe forms of malaria, have host-&#xD;
           and stage-specific proteins that can induce immunity to the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccines against stages that infect mosquitoes will prevent the spread of malaria.&#xD;
           Researchers have developed a vaccine composed of a single protein, Pfs25, to induce&#xD;
           antibodies in the human host that will be ingested by the mosquito and prevent the&#xD;
           malaria parasite from reproducing and stop transmission of the disease. Because Pfs25 is&#xD;
           present only in the mosquito, humans do not develop antibodies to this antigen even in&#xD;
           endemic areas. Repeated injections of this vaccine may be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To establish the safety and optimal dosage of a malaria vaccine developed with the Pfs25&#xD;
      protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults between 18 and 49 years of age who have never had malaria or received a&#xD;
      malaria vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two doses of Pfs25 conjugate (10 micrograms and 25 micrograms) will be evaluated in this&#xD;
           study. Participants will receive only one of these doses in order to provide the best&#xD;
           scientific data for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine eligibility, participants will provide a medical history and have a&#xD;
           physical examination, and will provide blood and urine samples to test for HIV/AIDS,&#xD;
           hepatitis, and other conditions that would prevent them from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will receive one injection of the vaccine. The injection will be&#xD;
           followed 30 minutes later with a temperature reading and an inspection of the vaccine&#xD;
           site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon leaving the clinic, participants will receive diary forms, a digital thermometer, a&#xD;
           ruler, and instructions about how to take their temperature and to measure redness and&#xD;
           swelling (if any) at the injection site. About 6 hours later, and daily for 3 days,&#xD;
           participants will take their temperature at home and examine the injection site.&#xD;
           Participants will be examined at the clinic at 48 to 72 hours and on day 7 after an&#xD;
           injection. A blood sample will be taken 1 week after immunization. - Participants will&#xD;
           receive a second and third injection of the same vaccine at 6-week intervals, and will&#xD;
           follow the same recording procedure given above. Further blood samples will be taken at&#xD;
           regular intervals for up to 12 months after the vaccination, as directed by the study&#xD;
           researchers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malaria is a disease affecting millions of people in Africa, Asia, Central and South America&#xD;
      . It has its highest frequency, morbidity, and mortality in infants and young children. For&#xD;
      many reasons, a vaccine that would prevent this disease is sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, the most common and severe forms of malaria, have&#xD;
      host and stage specific proteins that can induce immunity to disease caused by this pathogen.&#xD;
      Surprisingly, vaccines against stages that infect mosquitos will prevent the spread of&#xD;
      malaria (transmission-blocking). We have developed a vaccine composed of a single protein,&#xD;
      denoted as Pfs25, to induce transmission-blocking antibodies in the human host. These&#xD;
      transmission-blocking antibodies will be ingested by the mosquito and inactivate the sexual&#xD;
      forms of the plasmodia (ookinetes) as they develop in the midgut of the mosquito. Because&#xD;
      Pfs25 is present only in the mosquito, humans do not develop antibody to this antigen even in&#xD;
      endemic areas. No antibodies were detected against Pfs25, a 21-kD protein expressed on&#xD;
      zygotes and ookinetes of P. falciparum and known to be a sensitive target of&#xD;
      transmission-blocking antibodies. Theoretically, frequent boosting with this antigen, as is&#xD;
      required for the other experimental malarial vaccines, would be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our investigational vaccine is based upon the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pfs25 is a low molecular weight protein and a poor immunogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bharti et al showed the protective action of antibodies to Pvs25 raised by intensive&#xD;
           immunization of rabbits and mice (these regimes are not suitable for humans) to the&#xD;
           recombinant protein. These findings have been confirmed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transmission of Plasmodia to mosquitos is mediated by their ingestion of gametocytes in&#xD;
           the human bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within 10 minutes, these gametocytes transform into gametes in the midgut of the&#xD;
           mosquito. The male gametocyte fertilizes the female to form a zygote. Twenty four hours&#xD;
           later ookinetes pierce the epithelium of the midgut and differentiates into an oocyst.&#xD;
           This cell type forms the sporozoite that lodges in the salivary gland and is the&#xD;
           infective form injected by the mosquito into the human host. Pfs25 may also be involved&#xD;
           in survival of the ookinete in the midgut and its transformation into the oocyst;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The immunogenicity of poor immunogens is increased, especially in infants, by covalently&#xD;
           binding them to medically-acceptable carrier proteins to form conjugates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pfs25 was bound to itself by the synthetic scheme used for Haemophilus influenzae type b&#xD;
      and other polysaccharides to proteins. The resultant conjugate was immunogenic and,&#xD;
      unexpectedly, antibodies elicited by this vaccine continued to rise 3 months and 7 months&#xD;
      after the second and third injections. The property of the Pfs25 conjugate to elicit&#xD;
      long-lived antibody at high levels is unique to this construct. Our data from Pfs25 conjugate&#xD;
      in mice suggest that administration of this vaccine to the whole population including infants&#xD;
      along with their routine immunizations may be sufficient to elicit long-lived, effective&#xD;
      transmission-blocking activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our plan is to evaluate clinical lots of this conjugate for P. falciparum and for P. vivax,&#xD;
      for their safety and immunogenicity in adults, children and infants, and then to establish a&#xD;
      clinical site to test their efficacy.&#xD;
