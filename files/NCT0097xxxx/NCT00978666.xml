  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use fMRI imaging technology to examine areas in the brain&#xD;
      related to appetite, reward and cognition in adolescent women with eating disorders as&#xD;
      compared to those who have never had an eating disorder. Better understanding biologic&#xD;
      vulnerabilities in women with anorexia is essential for developing more effective treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) have aberrant feeding behavior, disturbances of&#xD;
      emotionality and impulse control, and have high rates of relapse after weight restoration&#xD;
      (Carter et al., 2004; Halmi et al., 2003). There is no proven treatment that reverses&#xD;
      symptoms. Although imaging studies in individuals recovered from AN (REC AN) suggest that&#xD;
      these symptoms are related to dysfunction of the striatal, insular, and prefrontal areas,&#xD;
      less is known about the biology of these core symptoms in currently ill individuals (ILL AN).&#xD;
      This application will use blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) to examine neural substrates underlying appetitive, reward, and cognitive&#xD;
      dysregulation in ill AN. We will study 22 adolescent women currently ill with AN and 22&#xD;
      healthy adolescent control women (CW), all of whom are 14 to 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: The anterior insula (AI), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and associated regions integrate&#xD;
      sensory/hedonic aspects of taste and interoceptive awareness in the service of homeostasis.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that restricted eating and weight loss occur in AN because a palatable food&#xD;
      elicits little reward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Little in life is rewarding to individuals with AN aside from weight loss, and they&#xD;
      tend to be overconcerned with future consequences. We predict that ill AN will show an&#xD;
      inability to discriminate positive and negative feedback reflecting aberrant anterior ventral&#xD;
      striatum (AVS) limbic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: AN tend to be rigid, inflexible and behaviorally inhibited. We will use a stop task&#xD;
      (Band et al., 2003; Logan et al., 1984; Matthews et al., 2005) to characterize the neural&#xD;
      substrates of inhibitory motor control. We hypothesize that ill AN, relative to CW, will show&#xD;
      a demand-specific alteration of a fronto-subthalamic circuit that is necessary for motor&#xD;
      inhibition (Aron et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 4: In an exploratory aim, we propose to examine how clinical, cognitive, and&#xD;
      personality/temperament measures might be correlated to either the BOLD response and/or the&#xD;
      integrity of frontostriatal connectivity as determined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these aims will enable us to better characterize cognitive and limbic&#xD;
      dysfunction in these populations. Understanding biologic vulnerabilities in AN is critical&#xD;
      for developing effective treatment interventions for this often chronic and deadly disorder.&#xD;
      In addition, there is a lack of understanding of appropriate methodologies necessary to&#xD;
      address the unique problems inherent in the study of ill AN. Thus, this project will also&#xD;
      characterize confounding factors, such as brain volume, energy metabolism, development&#xD;
      stages, and gonadal steroids, with the intent that a future project will incorporate the&#xD;
      methodology needed to rigorously investigate this population.&#xD;
