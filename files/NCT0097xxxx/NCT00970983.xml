  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the disease free and overall survival of patients&#xD;
      with breast carcinomas of small size, i.e., not greater than 2.0 cm and with clinically non&#xD;
      palpable axillary lymph nodes, undergoing either conservative surgery and axillary&#xD;
      dissection, or a similar treatment for the primary tumor and rapid analysis of the sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node, the result of which determines axillary node dissection or its avoidance is&#xD;
      based.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The axillary lymph nodes represent the most frequent site of metastasis from breast&#xD;
      carcinoma. In previous studies, it has been shown that the process of metastasis to the&#xD;
      axillary nodes proceeds in an orderly and progressive fashion from the I to the II and to the&#xD;
      III level and that a &quot;saltatory&quot; event of metastasis represents a rare event described in&#xD;
      only 2% to 6% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of metastasis is directly correlated with the size of the primary tumor. When&#xD;
      smaller than 1 cm in diameter, the risk of metastasis is about 10%; when larger than 5 cm in&#xD;
      diameter, the risk increases to more than 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The involvement of axillary lymph nodes by metastases constitutes today the most important&#xD;
      prognostic factor in breast cancer. Massive invasion is most certainly associated with a poor&#xD;
      outcome and therefore, the information that the lymph node status can provide, is&#xD;
      indispensible for administration of appropriate therapies in the postoperative period.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, in those cases where the lymph nodes are found to be free of metastases,&#xD;
      axillary dissection is a useless treatment that can prove harmful if one considers all the&#xD;
      possible short and long term complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, there are no diagnostic modalities that are able to provide an accurate lymph node&#xD;
      staging preoperatively. This information can only be gained by histologic examination of all&#xD;
      lymph nodes after complete axillary dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment for operable breast cancer today always involves the dissection of the&#xD;
      axillary lymph nodes, regardless of the surgical procedure used for resection of the primary&#xD;
      tumor, i.e. conservative or demolitive. This not only results in a large expenditure of&#xD;
      resources (longer surgical procedures under general anesthesia), but most notably, in an&#xD;
      increased risk of complications (lymphedema and functional limitations of the involved&#xD;
      extremity) for the patient, secondary to a more aggressive intervention on the axilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A method utilizing preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative use of a gamma-ray&#xD;
      probe in order to evaluate the possibility of metastasis in the first axillary lymph node,&#xD;
      i.e. the &quot;sentinel node&quot;, has recently been put into practice at our institute. This method,&#xD;
      which in its first part consists in the subcutaneous or peritumoral administration of a&#xD;
      radiolabeled (99Tc) human albumin colloid (see methods section), has allowed isolation and&#xD;
      excision of the sentinel lymph node with the use of the gamma-ray probe in 98.8% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case that this procedure should prove highly predictable of patient outcome, numerous&#xD;
      axillary lymphadenectomies could be avoided and with such, numerous complications associated&#xD;
      with such aggressive intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first phase study has evaluated 238 patients with breast carcinoma that would be candidates&#xD;
      for complete axillary dissection. Patients with intraductal carcinoma, those candidates for&#xD;
      primary chemotherapy, those diagnosed during pregnancy or lactation, and those with tumors&#xD;
      less than 1 cm in size (because of inclusion in the randomized trial (053) evaluating the&#xD;
      role of radiotherapy on the axilla in patients undergoing conservative surgery without&#xD;
      axillary node dissection) were excluded from the study. The results of this first phase have&#xD;
      shown a concordance in the histologic findings between the sentinel lymph node and all&#xD;
      remaining axillary lymph nodes, subdivided into three levels, in 96.7% of cases. Furthermore,&#xD;
      concordance was 100% in 18 patients with breast carcinoma of a size equal or less than 1.0&#xD;
      cm.&#xD;
