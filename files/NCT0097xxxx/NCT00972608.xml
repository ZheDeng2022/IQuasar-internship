      The purpose of this study is to utilize cardiac imaging data acquired as part of the standard&#xD;
      of care for these patients, such as MRI, 3D echo, and CT, and existing 3D reconstruction&#xD;
      protocols to assess the feasibility of using surgical planning in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with complex cardiac defects. The specific aims of the project are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a protocol to reconstruct heart models from patient imaging data and perform&#xD;
           &quot;virtual&quot; surgery on reconstructed 3D anatomy using appropriate, pre-existing patient&#xD;
           datasets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use the developed protocol to prospectively plan and evaluate the possible surgical&#xD;
           options for new patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Validate that the optimal virtual anatomy agrees with what was surgically implemented&#xD;
           using post-operative patient scans, when available.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, approximately 1 in 200 babies are born each year with harmful&#xD;
      congenital heart defects (CHD) that require some form of medical management. Often, these&#xD;
      defects consist of holes in the septum (the walls between the heart chambers) and/or abnormal&#xD;
      development of the heart chambers or major blood vessels. Surgery is the primary treatment&#xD;
      course for many of these patients and, through the use of patches and artificial vessels, it&#xD;
      is often possible to repair the defects and recreate the normal blood flow path through the&#xD;
      heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These techniques are not always simple, however, and the surgeon must take great care not to&#xD;
      harm the pumping function of the heart. In more complex cases, the surgeon must decide&#xD;
      between multiple repair strategies that will have a major effect on the long-term health of&#xD;
      the patient. It would be helpful in such cases for the surgeon to be able to assess the&#xD;
      repair options prior to the operation using virtual 3-dimensional representations of that&#xD;
      patient's anatomy. Having this ability would remove some of the uncertainty from the&#xD;
      decision-making process by providing accurate predictions of post-surgical anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, the technology exists to include such a surgical planning tool into the standard&#xD;
      treatment course for these patients. Using 3D anatomical images, acquired from basic,&#xD;
      techniques such as magnetic resonance (MR), computed tomography (CT), and echocardiography,&#xD;
      engineers at Georgia Tech have the ability to build accurate 3D models of patient anatomy,&#xD;
      such as the heart. Using these models with a state-of-the-art graphics manipulation tool,&#xD;
      surgeons would have the ability to virtually operate on the patient and select the optimal&#xD;
      treatment approach, as previously discussed. Similar techniques have already been developed&#xD;
      and used to plan surgeries for a limited subset of CHD patients with a single ventricle&#xD;
      physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to further develop these techniques and apply them to a broader&#xD;
      range of CHD patients. To do this, patients undergoing an appropriate surgical repair will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate in the study. Images obtained from pre-operative scans will be used&#xD;
      to build the anatomical model, which the surgeon will manipulate to test the different&#xD;
      available options. By successfully testing and eventually implementing these techniques in&#xD;
      the standard of care for CHD patients, the optimal approach for reconstruction will be&#xD;
      implemented more frequently, and thus patient outcomes will improve.&#xD;
