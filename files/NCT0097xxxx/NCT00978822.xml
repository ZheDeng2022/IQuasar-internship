    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess how rapidly and how safely Clevidipine can be used to&#xD;
      control high Blood Pressure in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage which is a type of brain&#xD;
      bleed that happens because of a weak balloon like structure in one of the brain vessels.&#xD;
      Control of blood pressure is of high value in preventing this balloon that ruptured and bled&#xD;
      from rebleeding. The ultimate cure would be to shut down the aneurysm by a surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Clevidipine is a drug that can lower blood pressure and it is given through the&#xD;
      vein as a continuous infusion. It is a very short acting drug which is important in&#xD;
      controlling labile blood pressure condition with rapid changes between up and down. This&#xD;
      trial will test for its rapid actions and check for any side effects and possibly any other&#xD;
      potential benefit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single-arm, non-blinded dose titration efficacy and safety trial&#xD;
      evaluating the ability of clevidipine, a vascular-selective L-type calcium channel&#xD;
      antagonist, to rapidly control acute hypertension in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage. At screening a clinical and neurological examination will be carried out. For the&#xD;
      purposes of this study, acute hypertension will be defined as a range of SBP to be controlled&#xD;
      within immediately prior to initiation of study drug. Approximately 20 patients with acute A&#xD;
      SAH will be enrolled. Infusion of study drug will be initiated as soon ass the patient&#xD;
      arrives in the ER and diagnosis is made and consent is obtained. All eligible patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled to receive clevidipine in an open label manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clevidipine will be infused at an initial rate of 2.0 mg/h for the first 90 seconds.&#xD;
      Thereafter, titration to higher infusion rates can be attempted as needed q90 seconds to&#xD;
      obtain the target SBP range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Titration to effect is to proceed by doubling the dose every 90 seconds, up to a maximum of&#xD;
      32.0 mg/h, until the desired effect (SBP within the target range) is attained. Clevidipine&#xD;
      infusion may continue for up to a maximum of 48 hours. Blood pressure and ICP recording will&#xD;
      be recorded q 5 minutes. Assessment of safety will be performed throughout the treatment&#xD;
      period and until 6 hours after termination of study drug.&#xD;
