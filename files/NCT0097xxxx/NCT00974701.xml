      This study is aimed at assessing the capability of the PillCam Platform using the PillCam ESO&#xD;
      2 Capsule in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining whether there is 1) active bleeding in the Upper gastrointestinal (UGI)&#xD;
           tract, 2) identifying the anatomic location of acute overt UGI bleeding, and 3)&#xD;
           discriminating a variceal versus non-variceal source of UGI bleeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH) is a prevalent, clinically significant, and&#xD;
      expensive healthcare problem worldwide. The incidence of acute, overt UGIH has been estimated&#xD;
      to be 50-150 cases per 100,000 adults in the United States population each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Significance / Rationale EGD is the currently accepted community standard for the&#xD;
      diagnosis and management of UGIH. Diagnostic EGD in persons presenting with acute UGIH allows&#xD;
      for (1) differentiating the source of bleeding (variceal vs. non-variceal), (2) defining the&#xD;
      anatomic location of the bleeding site (e.g., esophagus, stomach, duodenum), (3) providing an&#xD;
      endoscopic diagnosis, and (4) facilitating patient triage for subsequent level of care (ICU,&#xD;
      monitored bed, non-monitored bed, early / expedited hospital discharge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capsule endoscopy for the small bowel was cleared by the FDA in 2001, and within a short&#xD;
      time, has gained acceptance as providing state-of-the-art endoscopic imaging. Capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy is now commonly used in the evaluation of patients with obscure gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding, including iron deficiency anemia, suspected and known Crohn's disease,&#xD;
      malabsorption syndromes (e.g., Celiac disease), and chronic abdominal pain. Capsule endoscopy&#xD;
      technology is now also being applied to evaluation of the esophagus (PillCam® ESO, Given&#xD;
      Imaging, Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel) and the colon (PillCam® COLON). Recently, a second generation&#xD;
      esophageal capsule endoscope (PillCam® ESO 2, Given Imaging Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel) was cleared&#xD;
      by the United States Food and Drug Administration in June 2007. While having the same outer&#xD;
      dimensions (length and diameter) as the original PillCam ESO capsule, several significant&#xD;
      improvements have been made to the internal components of the PillCam ESO 2. Similar to the&#xD;
      original PillCam ESO, the system includes a sensor array and data recording device which are&#xD;
      connected to the patient during the procedure. The recorded data is downloaded into the Given&#xD;
      Imaging RAPID® workstation for review of the capsule endoscopy video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are no published detailed data evaluating the feasibility of utilizing PillCam&#xD;
      ESO 2 in individuals presenting with acute, overt UGI bleeding. Moreover, there are no data&#xD;
      comparing PillCam ESO 2 and EGD in the evaluation of this patient population. Therefore, in&#xD;
      this proof-of-concept pilot study, we will evaluate the feasibility and safety of using&#xD;
      PillCam ESO 2 in individuals presenting with acute, overt UGI bleeding.&#xD;
