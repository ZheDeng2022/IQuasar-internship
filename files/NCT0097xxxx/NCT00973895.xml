      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccines are substances used to try to create resistance (or immunity) to a disease and&#xD;
           to prevent an infection. Researchers are testing a new DNA vaccine designed for a new&#xD;
           type of influenza, often referred to as swine flu. The DNA vaccine will instruct the&#xD;
           body to make a particular kind of influenza protein that the immune system will be able&#xD;
           to recognize.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in determining if the vaccine is safe and effective in&#xD;
           humans, and would like to study the immune system's response to the vaccine. The vaccine&#xD;
           will not give participants influenza; however, it may not be effective in preventing&#xD;
           them from getting influenza at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP influenza vaccine as&#xD;
           administered to healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate antibody responses to the new influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have seven planned clinic visits during this study (enrollment day and&#xD;
           study weeks 1, 4, 8, 9, 12, and 32).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will receive three injections of the test vaccine, given as individual&#xD;
           doses on day 0, day 28, and day 56 of the study. The vaccine will be given in the upper&#xD;
           arm muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injections will be given using a needleless system that delivers the vaccine through the&#xD;
           skin by using the pressure of carbon dioxide to inject the vaccine through the skin and&#xD;
           into the muscle. Participants will remain at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)&#xD;
           Clinical Center for at least 30 minutes after the injection to be monitored for any&#xD;
           reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to keep a 7-day diary card after each injection to record&#xD;
           their physical reactions to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to return to the NIH Clinical Center as requested by&#xD;
           researchers for additional blood tests and other procedures, as required by the study.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN- This is an open-label Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of 3- injection vaccination regimen with an investigational plasmid DNA&#xD;
      vaccine that encodes for H1 hemagglutinin (HA) of an H1N1 influenza virus. All study&#xD;
      participants will be offered to receive an additional optional booster immunization with&#xD;
      licensed inactivated monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the DNA vaccine will be safe for human administration and will elicit&#xD;
      an antibody response. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP DNA vaccine at a dosage of 4 mg administered in a 3-injection&#xD;
      schedule. The secondary objectives are to evaluate antibody responses including induced&#xD;
      antibody titer as measured by a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay and to document the&#xD;
      reactogenicity of the inactivated H1N1 influenza vaccine when administered to subjects&#xD;
      previously vaccinated with the VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP DNA vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives are related to further evaluation of the humoral and cellular immune&#xD;
      responses, including the responses after each injection and after the boost with licensed&#xD;
      H1N1 inactivated influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS- The VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP vaccine was developed and manufactured by VRC,&#xD;
      NIAID and is composed of 1 closed-circular DNA plasmid with a CMV/R promoter that encodes for&#xD;
      the H1 hemagglutinin from the Influenza A/California/04/2009 H1N1 virus, identified late in&#xD;
      the 2008-2009 northern hemisphere (NH) influenza season that has been referred to as swine&#xD;
      flu in news reports. Vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL and each 4 mg dosage will&#xD;
      require a 1 mL injection. Vaccinations with the H1 DNA vaccine will be administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle using the Biojector[R] 2000 Needle-Free Injection&#xD;
      Management System (Biojector). Licensed inactivated monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine will be&#xD;
      obtained through the NIH Clinical Center (CC) pharmacy, for use as a booster injection, and&#xD;
      administered with needle and syringe. The brand administered will depend upon what is&#xD;
      available through the NIH CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS- A total of 20 healthy adults in the 18-70 years age range will be enrolled;&#xD;
      however, no more than 10 subjects will be in the 51-70 year old age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PLAN- All subjects will receive 3 injections of the H1 DNA vaccine as shown in the&#xD;
      schedule below. No more than 5 subjects may be enrolled in the first week of the study.&#xD;
      Following the 5th enrollment, the remainder of subjects may be enrolled without restrictions&#xD;
      on enrollment rate. All subjects that have no contraindications to the licensed - inactivated&#xD;
      H1N1 influenza vaccine or to additional blood drawing will be offered the option to receive&#xD;
      the licensed inactivated H1N1 influenza vaccine. The study includes 7 clinic visits and 3&#xD;
      telephone contacts as well as 3 additional visits for subjects that opt to receive an&#xD;
      inactivated influenza vaccine. Subjects who have received the inactivated H1N1 vaccine&#xD;
      outside of the VRC Clinic after Study Week 12 may consent to contribute the additional&#xD;
      research samples through completing the extra visits on the schedule for post boost&#xD;
      evaluations. A target window for the inactivated H1N1 vaccine is shown in the schema below.&#xD;
      However, given that all subjects will be at or beyond Study Week 12, the earliest mutually&#xD;
      convenient date after the H1N1 vaccine supply and amended protocol become available is&#xD;
      acceptable for administration of the optional injection. The added post-boost research sample&#xD;
      collections will then be scheduled to occur relative to the date the H1N1 booster injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects = 20&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP 4 mg on Day 0; 4mg on Day 28 plus or minus 7; 4mg on Day 56 plus or minus&#xD;
      7, at least 21 days between injections. Inactivated licensed H1N1 influenza vaccine&#xD;
      (optional) Day 168 plus or minus 28 - 1 dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION- Each participant will complete 32 weeks of clinical follow up.&#xD;
