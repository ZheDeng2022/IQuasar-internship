  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin can prevent ischemic vascular disease but is commonly complicated by dyspepsia in 30%&#xD;
      of patients. Patients, who have aspirin related dyspepsia, commonly underwent upper endoscopy&#xD;
      to exclude peptic ulcer disease or gastric cancers. For those without significant lesions in&#xD;
      the stomach and duodenum (non-ulcer dyspepsia), the best approach in the management is&#xD;
      unclear. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of esomeprazole and&#xD;
      famotidine in the control of dyspeptic symptom. After giving consent, patients will be&#xD;
      randomised to receive either esomeprazole 20 mg daily or famotidine 40 mg daily in a double&#xD;
      blinded manner. The patient will be followed-up at the 2nd and 4th week. The study will be&#xD;
      completed at the 4th week. The primary analysis will be the efficacy in the control of&#xD;
      dyspepsia symptom between the two groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this double blinded randomized controlled study is to compare the efficacy&#xD;
      of esomeprazole with famotidine in the control of dyspepsia in patients with aspirin related&#xD;
      nonulcer dyspepsia NUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study shall be applied for approval from the Ethic Committee of Hong Kong West and East&#xD;
      Cluster and shall be registered to the Clinical Trial Governance before the recruitment of&#xD;
      the first patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring instruments &amp; Definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hong Kong Dyspepsia Index (HKDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence or absence of dyspepsia was measured by the validated Hong Kong index of&#xD;
      dyspepsia . This questionnaire could be used in epidemiological studies assessing the&#xD;
      frequency and severity of dyspepsia in patient populations and also in interventional studies&#xD;
      in functional dyspepsia.This index consisted of 12 questions on the severity of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, graded according to a five-point Likert scale (1- 5, from&#xD;
      asymptomatic to very severe symptoms). A cut-off score of equal to or greater than 16 was&#xD;
      determined to discriminate between controls and dyspeptic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global Dyspepsia Score&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global severity of dyspepsia will be measured by the Global Dyspepsia Score, which was a&#xD;
      four-point scale in which a score of 0 indicated no pain or discomfort, a score of 1 mild&#xD;
      pain or discomfort, a score of 2 moderate (annoying but not interfering with the daily&#xD;
      routine) pain or discomfort, and a score of 3 severe (markedly interfering with the daily&#xD;
      routine) pain or discomfort over the last 7 days . This scale is reliable, valid, and&#xD;
      responsive and provides global assessment of symptoms in the western population . Significant&#xD;
      dyspepsia was defined when Global Dyspepsia Score was more than or equal to 2 moderate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of significant endoscopic finding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant finding was defined as the presence of reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus,&#xD;
      gastric or duodenal ulceration, duodenal or esophageal erosions, or cancer and those with&#xD;
      more than five gastric erosions on upper endoscopy. (Tally N, NEJM 1999)&#xD;
