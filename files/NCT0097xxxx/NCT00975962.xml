  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a blinded randomized study. Randomization for treatment/not treatment with&#xD;
      remote perconditioning takes place during transportation to the hospital. This is because the&#xD;
      investigators' hypothesis states that remote perconditioning is neuro-protective and the&#xD;
      effect is proportionally larger with early treatment. As the size of the effect is unknown,&#xD;
      the investigators will use multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to determine the&#xD;
      size of a potential neuro-protective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe method of remote perconditioning in clinical practice regarding feasibility.&#xD;
           Pros and cons and potential limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the size of the effect of remote perconditioning in combination with&#xD;
           recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPa) treatment within four and a half hours&#xD;
           of onset of symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>Remote perconditioning (rIPerC) undertaken in ambulance on rute to hospital in case of suspected stroke.&#xD;
The rIPerC consists of 4 cycles of 5 minute total occlusion of blood flow to the non-paretic arm separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion. The occlusion is secured by inflating a standard blood pressure cuff to 25 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure. Written instruction on cuff inflation and paramedic's documentation of their procedure were written in a standard report which was turned over to a study nurse upon arrival to the hospital, and filed. The investigators were hence blinded to the prehospital rIPerC.</description>
