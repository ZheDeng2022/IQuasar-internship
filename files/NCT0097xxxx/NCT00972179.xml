    <textblock>
      This study will follow a randomized, multiple-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      sequential dose-escalation study design. This healthy volunteer study will consist of five&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) cohorts and one intravenous (IV) cohort. Each dose cohort will enroll 8&#xD;
      subjects, randomized such that 6 subjects will receive AMG 157 and 2 will receive placebo&#xD;
      (3:1 ratio). The doses of AMG 157 planned to be evaluated include 35 mg (SC every 28 days,&#xD;
      Cohort 1), 105 mg (SC every 28 days, Cohort 2), 210 mg (SC every 28 days, Cohort 3), 210 mg&#xD;
      (SC every 14 days, Cohort 4), 210 mg (SC every 7 days, Cohort 5) and 700 mg (IV every 28&#xD;
      days, Cohort 6).&#xD;
