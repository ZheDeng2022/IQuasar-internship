  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that maternal and fetal biologic variation in the balance&#xD;
      between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators can be measured by currently&#xD;
      available techniques. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that a pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      maternal phenotype increases the risk of fetal exposure to intrauterine hyperthemia and&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines; and that intrapartum events, especially known risk factors for fever&#xD;
      at term such as epidural analgesia and prolonged rupture of membranes, may interact with&#xD;
      underlying maternal factors to increase fetal exposure to inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment aims to establish the first large-scale cohort to evaluate biomarkers for&#xD;
      maternal and fetal inflammation in term pregnancy and to elucidate the relative antepartum&#xD;
      and intrapartum contributions to fetal inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that intrapartum fever &gt;100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is associated with&#xD;
      increased maternal and fetal levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) at delivery. Maternal and fetal&#xD;
      IL-6 levels are highly correlated, and placental transport of cytokines has been&#xD;
      demonstrated. While intrapartum fever is traditionally attributed to acquired infection&#xD;
      (chorioamnionitis), our data indicate that the maternal inflammatory balance assessed prior&#xD;
      to the onset of labor may be a significant determinant of subsequent intrapartum fever. The&#xD;
      increased risk of neonatal brain injury may be cytokine mediated or may, in part, be&#xD;
      secondary to increased vulnerability to hypoxic injury in the setting of elevated fetal brain&#xD;
      temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline prevalence of intrapartum fever at term is 1-5%. Factors associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of intrapartum fever include maternal age, nulliparity (75%), Hispanic race,&#xD;
      induction and longer labor. However, in recent years, the most potent risk factor for&#xD;
      intrapartum fever has clearly been epidural analgesia - which is selected for intrapartum&#xD;
      pain relief by the majority of mothers in the US especially in the first, most painful birth.&#xD;
      We have demonstrated that the risk of fever after epidural analgesia increases with&#xD;
      increasing duration of epidural analgesia - therefore, the risk of fever after epidural&#xD;
      analgesia is largely confined to nulliparous women. Multiparous women deliver shortly after&#xD;
      the onset of active labor, resulting in a short duration of exposure to epidural analgesia,&#xD;
      and are not at increased risk. Randomized studies demonstrate that the independent&#xD;
      contribution of epidural analgesia to intrapartum fever risk is 3 to 7-fold. Rates of&#xD;
      intrapartum fever &gt;100.4 degrees Fahrenheit in nulliparas with epidural analgesia range from&#xD;
      14.5% to 33%. Rates at the upper end of this range are observed in large, public hospitals&#xD;
      with primarily Hispanic populations. Conversely, lower rates are observed at private&#xD;
      hospitals with primarily Caucasian populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will make observations based upon:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 10 mL of blood drawn the day of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 10 mL of blood drawn upon admission to Labor and Delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A sample of spinal fluid if a spinal epidural is chosen by the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood collected from the placenta and umbilical cord&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the mother's temperature will be taken every hour during labor.&#xD;
