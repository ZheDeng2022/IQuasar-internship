  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of the combination of bortezomib and&#xD;
      tipifarnib. Bortezomib (VELCADE) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for&#xD;
      the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy.&#xD;
      Tipifarnib is not yet approved by the FDA and is an investigational drug. &quot;Investigational&quot;&#xD;
      means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out&#xD;
      more about it. Because these drugs have not been used together before, it is not clear which&#xD;
      dose of each agent is optimal when used in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of&#xD;
      an investigational drug. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational drugs to use for further studies. The investigators will test the safety of&#xD;
      BORTEZOMIB and TIPIFARNIB together and see what effects (good and bad) it has on you and your&#xD;
      MULTIPLE MYELOMA, and to find the highest dose of both agents that can be given without&#xD;
      causing severe side effects.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients included in the study must meet criteria for relapsed or refractory multiple&#xD;
             myeloma. Relapsed myeloma is defined in patients as increasing M-Spike or plasmacytoma&#xD;
             compared to a previous measurement confirmed on at least two different settings.&#xD;
             Refractory myeloma is defined as progression of disease on current therapy, and having&#xD;
             received at least two courses of treatment with or without the use of high dose&#xD;
             therapy and autologous transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy in order to be eligible&#xD;
             for this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently&#xD;
             available on the use of bortezomib in combination with tipifarnib in patients &lt; 18&#xD;
             years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future&#xD;
             pediatric phase 1 combination trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%, see&#xD;
             Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes ≥ 1,000/microliter (mcL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 25,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 X&#xD;
                  institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine ≤ 2.5 OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² for patients with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility of patients receiving any medications or substances with the potential or&#xD;
             known to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of bortezomib or tipifarnib will be&#xD;
             determined following review of their case by the Principal Investigator. Patients must&#xD;
             be on bisphosphonates therapy unless precluded by osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) or&#xD;
             other clinical circumstances at the investigators discretion. Patients may receive&#xD;
             erythroid growth factors as needed, per institutional guidelines. Patients cannot be&#xD;
             receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (e.g., phenytoin,&#xD;
             carbamazepine, phenobarbital) nor any other cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducer such&#xD;
             as rifampin or St. John's wort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of bortezomib and tipifarnib on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason, women with child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception prior to entering the study. Adequate contraception includes hormonal&#xD;
             therapy, a barrier method of birth control or abstinence. Appropriate contraception&#xD;
             must be used for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant&#xD;
             or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately, and will be immediately discontinued from the study.&#xD;
             Any woman who becomes pregnant during the study will be followed throughout their&#xD;
             pregnancy until its outcome (i.e. delivery, still birth, miscarriage).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female subject is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to&#xD;
                  use an acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive,&#xD;
                  intra-uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or&#xD;
                  abstinence) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method of contraception for the duration&#xD;
                  of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure&#xD;
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn&#xD;
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to boronic acid, bortezomib, tipifarnib, or other agents used in study.&#xD;
             Known allergy to imidazole drugs, such as clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole,&#xD;
             econazole, fenticonazole, isoconazole, sulconazole, tioconazole or terconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a poorly controlled intercurrent illness will be excluded including but&#xD;
             not limited to those with ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             climate that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bortezomib and tipifarnib are&#xD;
             Class D agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with bortezomib and tipifarnib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with bortezomib and tipifarnib. These potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with bortezomib and tipifarnib. In&#xD;
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has hypersensitivity to boron or mannitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject is pregnant or breast-feeding. Confirmation that the subject is not&#xD;
             pregnant must be established by a negative serum ß-human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             (ß-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not&#xD;
             required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has received other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this&#xD;
             clinical trial.&#xD;
