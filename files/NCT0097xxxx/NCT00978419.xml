  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 90 day study, with patients receiving either oral Rosuvastatin or placebo for up to&#xD;
      28 days. The study will assess the affect of statins administered soon after burn injury on&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, patient mortality and the incidence of septic shock. The&#xD;
      investigators also seek to describe the correlation between exposure to statins and&#xD;
      development of delirium and de-novo long-term cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Statin administration within 96 hours of burn is safe, will decrease CRP, and will&#xD;
           decrease septic shock and mortality in burn patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators hypothesize that burn patients will have a de-novo long term cognitive&#xD;
           impairment at 3 months after burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators hypothesize the use of statins in burn patients will reduce the&#xD;
           development and the degree of cognitive impairment at 3 months post burn.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection and sepsis are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in burn patients.&#xD;
      Several observational studies have shown that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, known as statins,&#xD;
      before or after illness or injury results in decreased mortality and incidence of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We performed a pilot retrospective chart review of 223 patients admitted to the Vanderbilt&#xD;
      University Burn Service from 2006-2008 who were ≥55 years of age. Patients were identified as&#xD;
      using statin drugs prior to burn, and compared to those who were not. There was a significant&#xD;
      decrease in mortality of 83% (P=.004) in the statin group and a 50% reduction in septic shock&#xD;
      (p=.155) that was not significant likely due to the low numbers of patients with septic shock&#xD;
      (n=30). These effects were unchanged after controlling for cardiovascular comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies have also shown decreased mortality and sepsis with pre-injury statin&#xD;
      administration. Mechanisms of statin effect on mortality and septic shock are attributed to&#xD;
      the so-called pleiotropic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the use of statins is potentially expected to reduce mortality, it is even more relevant&#xD;
      to understand the long-term cognitive and functional outcomes of the survivors. In the last&#xD;
      years researchers highlighted how survivors from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      largely experience cognitive and functional decline after their acute illness. More recently&#xD;
      Jackson et al. advocated a relationship between delirium in intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      patients and cognitive impairment; more specifically 1 of 3 survivors of critically illness&#xD;
      with delirium developed cognitive impairment. Though every year several patients are admitted&#xD;
      to burn units in the United States, to date only one small report has been published&#xD;
      addressing the long-term cognitive outcomes of burn ICU patients. In these preliminary data,&#xD;
      Varney et al. found that of the eight patients all were found to have significant problems as&#xD;
      evidenced in neuropsychological tests, activities of daily living, and from relatives'&#xD;
      reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes of development of a de-novo cognitive impairment in this population are probably&#xD;
      multifactorial and could be linked to the development of and duration of delirium or to the&#xD;
      exposure to large amount of sedatives-analgesics used to assure the comfort of the patients&#xD;
      on the ventilator and to control pain secondary to the burn. ICU delirium is a common acute&#xD;
      brain dysfunction with a prevalence as high as 80% in critically ill surgical and medical ICU&#xD;
      patients depending on the severity of illness and the instrument used to diagnose delirium.&#xD;
      Different risk factors have been called to cause delirium including exposure to drugs. In&#xD;
      particular, previous studies have shown how exposure to benzodiazepines (i.e. lorazepam and&#xD;
      midazolam) and opiates have been associated to transition to delirium in medical and surgical&#xD;
      ICU patients. If sedatives and analgesics are widely used in the medical and surgical ICUs,&#xD;
      this is even more striking for the burn units where large amounts of drugs are infused for&#xD;
      patient comfort and pain control. Therefore a large exposure to these drugs in burn patients&#xD;
      has the potential to influence the prevalence of delirium even more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatine kinase (CK) levels are known to be increased in the serum of burn patients.&#xD;
      C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is an hepatically derived acute phase reactant, elevated in burn&#xD;
      patients within the first 3 days, and decreases over time. Statins are known to decrease CRP&#xD;
      and possibly mitigate the inflammatory response due to CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin (Crestor) was chosen as the study drug over others for pharmacokinetic and side&#xD;
      effect profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rosuvastatin has an elimination half-life of 19 hours, making it suitable for once a day&#xD;
           dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rosuvastatin is excreted 90% unchanged in the stool, and the other 10% by the liver.&#xD;
           (Rosuvastatin drug information, package insert).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rosuvastatin, a hydrophilic statin, seems to be associated with fewer side effects than&#xD;
           lipophilic statins and has fewer drug-drug interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin dose will be 40 mg loading dose first day, then 20mg by mouth or feeding tube&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with thermal burn will be recruited on admission to the Vanderbilt University Burn&#xD;
      Service within 96 hours from the time of the burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will accrue 40 patients admitted to the Burn Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      alpha = 0.05 power = .80 delta= 200-(.64 * 200) =72(expected difference statin and non-statin&#xD;
      subjects) sigma = 80 (95% CI CRP burn patients at 3 days) m = 1 (ratio controls/experimental)&#xD;
      Sample size=20&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from the patient or surrogate prior to enrollment in the&#xD;
      trial. No study procedures will be done without first obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, patients will be assigned to Rosuvastatin or placebo&#xD;
      group on a random 1:1 basis. The study will be double blind, with neither the participant,&#xD;
      research staff nor clinical staff having knowledge of the treatment assignment until after&#xD;
      the database has been locked. Assignment will be made by computer-generated randomization.&#xD;
      Placebo will be an inactive tablet provided by the Vanderbilt Investigational Pharmacy that&#xD;
      is not distinguishable in appearance from Rosuvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be considered to have completed the administration of the study drug when any&#xD;
      of the following conditions is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 28 days after randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Discharge from the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because CPK is routinely elevated in burn patients and myopathy from statins is very rare and&#xD;
      is a delayed side effect, CKs before day 7 of treatment will not be used to trigger the rule&#xD;
      for withholding/discontinuing study drug. Values greater than 10 times normal obtained after&#xD;
      day 7 will trigger cessation of study drug. Study drug will also be discontinued if the&#xD;
      patient develops ALT &gt; 8 times upper limit of normal after study day 1, or if the patient&#xD;
      begins treatment with niacin, fenofibrate, cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, lopinavir, ritonavir or&#xD;
      oral contraceptives. Data collection will continue as though therapy continued through study&#xD;
      day 90.&#xD;

      available, the closest value prior to the time of dosing will be recorded: serum creatinine,&#xD;
      bilirubin, glucose, CK, CRP, PT/PTT/INR and pre-albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.14 Follow-up Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following lab results will be recorded at the following timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serum CK will be collected on days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serum ALT will be collected days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serum CRP will be collected on days 3, 7, 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RASS scoring will be assessed and documented at 0800 each day +/- 8 hours. (Appendix B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium will be evaluated daily with the Confusion Assessment Method in the ICU (CAM- ICU)&#xD;
      up to 28 days. (Appendix C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type and total amount of sedatives and analgesic drugs will be collected daily up to 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADL 41 and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) will be evaluated at hospital&#xD;
      discharge. (Appendix D)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a 3-month follow-up patients will be evaluated with the ADL, IADL, MMSE, Hospital Anxiety&#xD;
      and Depression Scale (HADS), and the EuroQol.(Appendix E, F, G) The use of analgesics will&#xD;
      also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using STATA 9 statistical program. Demographics, characteristics of&#xD;
      burn, primary and secondary endpoints will be tabulated and compared across Rosuvastatin and&#xD;
      placebo groups. CRP levels by Rosuvastatin use and occurrence of septic shock will be&#xD;
      analyzed using area under the curve (AUC). Mortality and occurrence of septic shock adjusted&#xD;
      for cardiovascular co-morbidities will be examined using multivariate logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks of study drug include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Myopathy, defined as CK &gt; 10 times ULN, which has been reported in &lt; .01% of patients,&#xD;
           is usually reversible with discontinuation of the statin. Rhabdomyolysis, severe&#xD;
           myopathy, defined as CK &gt; 40 times ULN, can be expected in about a third of those, can&#xD;
           lead to renal failure from myoglobin release, requires stopping the study drug,&#xD;
           hydration and medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase in liver enzymes (in our study ALT &gt; 8 times ULN) after day 1, reported in .08%&#xD;
           after 4 months of statin use, and drug interactions. Simple discontinuation of the drug&#xD;
           is sufficient as there is no evidence that liver failure will ensue.23&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Additional uncommon risks of study drug include: headache, nausea, myalgia, asthenia,&#xD;
           abdominal pain, dizziness, and constipation, from the package insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will monitor CK and ALT levels and discontinue study drug if defined toxicity levels are&#xD;
      reached. CK and ALT levels that meet toxicity levels will be reported as adverse events.&#xD;
      Myopathy will be noted as an adverse event, but will not by itself stop study drug unless&#xD;
      associated with CK levels as defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event Recording Each adverse event occurring to a subject / patient, either&#xD;
      spontaneously revealed by the patient / subject or observed by the Investigator, whether&#xD;
      believed by the Investigator to be related or unrelated to the study drug, must be recorded&#xD;
      on the adverse event information page of the CRF and on the patient / subject's&#xD;
      hospital/center notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will also determine the relationship of any adverse event to study drug and&#xD;
      record it on the appropriate section of the CRF as well as their intensity, time of onset,&#xD;
      duration, and the precautions carried out. The Investigator must record all adverse events,&#xD;
      which occur during the study, regardless of their relationship to study drug and if they&#xD;
      occur during a period without administration of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event Reporting Investigators will assess the subject and medical record to determine&#xD;
      if adverse experiences occur during the 60 day study or to hospital discharge, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. The investigator will determine if any changes in laboratory values or clinical&#xD;
      signs are those expected in the course of a patient with burn injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Always reported as adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CK&gt; 10 times ULN after study day 7 ALT&gt; 8 times ULN after study day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events will have to be reported according to the following special procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will report SAE's to the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board per policy.&#xD;
      All serious adverse events that occur in association with the study will be reviewed by study&#xD;
      personnel and reported to the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board (IRB) within 10 days of&#xD;
      the Investigator's awareness of the event. Any new information that comes to light which may&#xD;
      affect the subject or their caregiver's decision to continue to participate in the study will&#xD;
      be passed on to them as soon as possible. This may also result in a change to the consent&#xD;
      form and review by the IRB. Serious adverse events will also be reported to and reviewed by&#xD;
      the data safety monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal investigator will collect data and enter it into password protected computer in&#xD;
      a locked office. Each patient will have a unique identifier number, with the key to the&#xD;
      patient's medical record number kept in a locked cabinet in the office. Only research&#xD;
      associates or those individuals directly involved with the study will have access to data.&#xD;
      Information is for research purposes only and when used for publication purposes, all&#xD;
      participants will have their names concealed. Access to identified patient information will&#xD;
      be limited to the investigators listed within the IRB application. De-identified information&#xD;
      with HIPAA identifiers removed will be available to other investigators following IRB&#xD;
      approval. Confidentiality and security will be maintained for the database. The database is&#xD;
      stored behind a firewall (in addition to the institutional firewall) with the highest level&#xD;
      of protection, i.e. the same level of protection as the on-line hospital information system&#xD;
      at Vanderbilt. This means that users must logon to a web server that sits between the&#xD;
      institutional firewall and the firewall to the database, and only this application server is&#xD;
      allowed to query the database. Only users approved through our institutional review board&#xD;
      will be allowed access to patient identifiers. Other levels of authorization may exist for&#xD;
      future approved users following IRB approval, e.g. access to de-identified data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is initially collected in the medical record for each individual study participant. The&#xD;
      information will be extracted from the patient's medical record and then transferred into the&#xD;
      Case Report Form (CRF). The study data will be kept on site and in a securely locked room to&#xD;
      protect patient confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRFs do not include personal identifiers for any participant. Numbers and initials are&#xD;
      assigned for each participant and these become the identifying information for each study&#xD;
      participant. A master list is kept separately that identifies which names go with which&#xD;
      numbers and initials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study personnel (PI and co-investigators) and government regulatory agencies have access to&#xD;
      all research records as required by law. Others (such as law enforcement agencies) may have&#xD;
      access to records as defined by law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and Record Retention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study records will be stored for investigation for at least six years and may be retained&#xD;
      indefinitely.&#xD;
