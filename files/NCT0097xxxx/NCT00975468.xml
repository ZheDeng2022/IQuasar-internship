  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared with the information available in sepsis and trauma-associated ARDS, less is known&#xD;
      about the cause and pattern of lung injury after thoracic surgery. Definition of lung injury&#xD;
      in this context is difficult. Most now use the joint North American-European consensus&#xD;
      conference definitions, but these are based only on gas exchange and radiology criteria.&#xD;
      While gas exchange measures are reliable, thoracotomy inevitably causes radiological change&#xD;
      and the interpretation of plain chest films becomes subjective. Definitions based on&#xD;
      permeability and inflammatory changes would improve diagnosis, but are not routinely&#xD;
      available in most units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure-controlled volume (PCV) may be useful to improve gas exchange and alveolar&#xD;
      recruitment with associated lower airway pressures and shunt fraction during one-lung&#xD;
      ventilation (OLV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a recent prospective randomized study of the effects of PCV during OLV did not lead&#xD;
      to improved oxygenation during OLV compared with VCV, but PCV did lead to lower peak airway&#xD;
      pressures. To date, there are no reports of the effects of PCV versus VCV during OLV on the&#xD;
      acute lung injury (ALI) after thoracotomy.&#xD;

      Project Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the use of PCV during OLV for thoracic surgery may improve the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory immunoregulation than VCV. It may attenuate the increases in&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukins (IL-8, IL-1, and IL-6) and TNF-α, and&#xD;
      prevent suppression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the present study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research efforts will focus on identifying the effects of PCV vs.VCV during OLV for&#xD;
      thoracotomy on the followings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intraoperative changes in the peak and plateau airway pressures and static and dynamic&#xD;
           lung compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pulmonary function tests [vital capacity and FEV1] and arterial blood gases changes&#xD;
           during the first 3 postoperative days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The perioperative changes in serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines, including&#xD;
           IL-1, IL-6, IL8, and TNF-α and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The perioperative changes in BAL levels of the concentration of proteins, IL-1, IL-6,&#xD;
           IL8, IL-10, and TNF-α.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The duration of postoperative ventilatory support, the time to extubation, the length of&#xD;
           stay in post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The incidence of the major complications (respiratory failure, cardiovascular events,&#xD;
           bleeding, and renal dysfunction).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized placebo-controlled blinded study will be carried out from at the&#xD;
      Cardiothoracic Surgery Unit - King Fahd University Hospital, after approval of the&#xD;
      Institutional Ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phases: The project comprised of five phases as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Phase I: Literature review collection and writing which will spend 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Phase II: Pilot Study for 2 months to determine changes in the serum levels of cytokines to&#xD;
      test the power of the study to define the proper sample size for both the VCV and PCV group&#xD;
      during OLV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Phase III: A. Thoracic procedures using one-ling ventilation techniques: Arterial blood&#xD;
      gases, chest X- ray, pulmonary function tests, liver function tests, CPK, samples collection&#xD;
      [serum and BAL] and laboratory testing for cytokine changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Recording of the Clinical Outcome: included the times of ventilation, extubation, ICU and&#xD;
      hospital stay, mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the OR suite and ICU at the King Fahd Hospital of the&#xD;
      University - Alkhubar Study period: For 6 months. I. Patient Selection: patients aged 18-60&#xD;
      years (ASA physical status II-III) scheduled for elective open thoracic surgery using one&#xD;
      lung ventilation for periods longer than 1.5 h will be allocated randomly to two groups by&#xD;
      drawing of sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes that each contained a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization code. We will exclude the patients with decompensated&#xD;
      cardiac (&gt;New York Heart Association II), pulmonary diseases (VC or FEV1&lt;50% of the predicted&#xD;
      values), pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure [MPAP] &gt;30 mm Hg), and&#xD;
      previous lobectomy or bilobectomy in the medical history, those treated with immune&#xD;
      modulators (cytostatic drugs, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,&#xD;
      vaccination, blood products), within 3 months before surgery and with symptoms of an acute&#xD;
      inflammatory process (clinically defined or abnormal data for C-reactive protein, leukocyte&#xD;
      count, or body temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Patient Groups and Study Protocol: Volume-controlled ventilation [VCV] group (n=according&#xD;
      to the power of the study): patients' lungs will ventilated with a tidal volume of 8 ml.kg-1.&#xD;
      Pressure-controlled ventilation [PCV] group (n=as before) patients' lungs ventilation will be&#xD;
      initiated with a peak airway pressure that provided a tidal volume of 8 ml.kg-1. R.R will be&#xD;
      adjusted to achieve an arterial PaCO2 4.5-6 kPa and FiO2 will be increased to 1.0 during OLV.&#xD;
      All staff in the operating room, ICU and the ward will be unaware of the randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Anesthesia and Surgery: The patients will undergo combined thoracic epidural analgesia&#xD;
      and general anesthesia using one lung ventilation technique for open thoracic surgical&#xD;
      procedures through a standard posterolateral or an anterolateral muscle-sparing thoracotomy&#xD;
      by the same consultants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. The Investigators who will be involved with subsequent postoperative patient assessment&#xD;
      will be blinded of the patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Clinical Examination: included the intraoperative changes in airway pressures and lung&#xD;
      compliances and the perioperative changes in pulmonary function tests [vital capacity and&#xD;
      FEV1], the duration of postoperative ventilatory support, the time to extubation, the length&#xD;
      of stay in PACU, the incidence of any major complications (respiratory failure,&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, bleeding, and renal dysfunction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Blood Biochemistry: included the perioperative changes in arterial blood gases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Samples Collection and Analysis For the Inflammatory Mediators: The perioperative&#xD;
      changes in serum levels of the concentration of the cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL8, IL-10, and&#xD;
      TNF-α, and the perioperative changes in BAL levels of the concentration of proteins, IL-1,&#xD;
      IL-6, IL8, IL-10, and TNF-α.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Type of samples: centrifuged stored aliquots of serum at -70°C and Supernatant frozen&#xD;
           (at -80°C) broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) aliquots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Laboratory Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Cytokine determinations on the BAL fluid and plasma will be carried out using a&#xD;
                solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method based on the quantitative&#xD;
                immunometric sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique (Quantikine®; R&amp;D Systems Ltd.,&#xD;
                Abingdon, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. TNF-α immunoassay will be provided by Immunotech, France. Protein concentrations&#xD;
                will be measured by an assay for the colorimetric detection and quantitation of&#xD;
                total protein (Micro BCA TM Protein Assay Reagent Kit; Pierce, Rockford, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. All samples of one patient will be analyzed in the same assay run.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The samples will be measured in duplicates and the assays will be performed&#xD;
                according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The optical density of the samples will be determined by a microplate reader&#xD;
                (Safire®; Tecan Ltd., Salzburg, Austria) and will be analyzed using the Safire&#xD;
                microplate reader software by interpolation from standard curves. The sensitivities&#xD;
                of the test kits are as follows: IL-1: 10 pg.mL-1, IL-6: 10 pg.mL-1, IL-8: 3.5&#xD;
                pg.mL-1, IL-10: 0.5 pg.mL-1, TNF : 5 pg.mL-1, protein: 0.5 µg.mL-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Statistical Analysis: 2months Statistical analysis will be performed using the&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data will be tested for&#xD;
      normality using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. An unpaired Student's t test will be used to compare&#xD;
      the parametric values of the two groups; Mann-Whitney U test will be performed to compare the&#xD;
      non-parametric values of the two groups. Serial changes in peri-operative data at the start&#xD;
      of the treatment will be analyzed with repeated measures analysis of variance. PFTs variables&#xD;
      and cytokine changes at different times within groups will be analysed with repeated measure&#xD;
      analysis of variance (Anova test). Data will be expressed as mean (SD), number (%) or (median&#xD;
      [range]). A value of P&lt;0.05 will be considered to represent statistical significance.&#xD;
