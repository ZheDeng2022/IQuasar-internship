  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of pulmonary disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) has been&#xD;
      increasing, and a substantial proportion of these patients have no preexisting lung disease&#xD;
      and no demonstrable immunodeficiency. These patients are predominantly nonsmoking elderly&#xD;
      women. High-resolution computed tomography scans revealed the characteristic findings of&#xD;
      multifocal bronchiectasis combined with multiple small nodules. NTMs are ubiquitous&#xD;
      environmental organisms. Because exposure to these organisms is universal and the occurrence&#xD;
      of the disease is rare, normal host defense mechanisms must be effective enough to prevent&#xD;
      the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with NTM lung disease do not need to receive long-term antibiotic treatment. As&#xD;
      the American Thoracic Society guidelines point out, one of the most difficult questions may&#xD;
      be when to start antibiotic therapy in patients with NTM lung disease. The decision to begin&#xD;
      treatment is made by weighing the anticipated benefits and risks. The decision is relatively&#xD;
      easy in patients with profound symptoms and destructive lesions; however, the decision is&#xD;
      difficult in patients with mild symptoms and non-advanced lesions. Factors that must be&#xD;
      considered include the patients' age, whether the symptoms are mild or equivocal, and the&#xD;
      presence of comorbidities. In all cases, close observation is necessary if treatment is not&#xD;
      performed. However, few studies have shown that patients with certain characteristics show&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of NTM pulmonary disease depends on the infecting species, but decisions&#xD;
      concerning the institution of treatment are never easy. Treatment requires the use of&#xD;
      multiple drugs for 18 to 24 months. Thus, treatment is expensive, often has significant side&#xD;
      effects, and is frequently not curative. Therefore, clinicians should be confident that there&#xD;
      is sufficient pathology to warrant prolonged, multidrug treatment regimens. In all of the&#xD;
      situations, outcomes can be best optimized only when clinicians, radiologists, and&#xD;
      laboratories work cooperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine why some people are more susceptible to NTM lung disease and why some&#xD;
      people of NTM lung disease are more difficult to treat. This study will examine the patient&#xD;
      and bacterial characteristics, course of disease and treatment of NTM infections, as well as&#xD;
      the genetics involved in these infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diagnosed NTM lung disease may be eligible for this study. All participants&#xD;
      will have a medical and family history, blood tests, imaging studies that may include X-rays,&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scans, and genetic and serologic studies. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to identify patient and bacterial characteristics that contribute to disease susceptibility,&#xD;
      disease progression, and treatment failure. Subjects are recruited from among patients who&#xD;
      are diagnosed to have NTM lung disease at the Samsung Medical Center in the Republic of&#xD;
      Korea.&#xD;
