    <textblock>
      The average period of asymptomatic HIV-infection is 8 years, at this stage, CD4+ T lymphocyte&#xD;
      count was reduced gradually at the rate of 50~100cells/ul/year. When the CD4 T lymphocyte&#xD;
      count dropped below 350cells/ul and viral load increased to 105 in AIDS patients, HAART will&#xD;
      be carried out. But, CD4 T lymphocyte was 350~550 cells/ul, there is no intervention&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

      -  The average period of asymptomatic HIV-infection is 8 years, at this stage, CD4+ T&#xD;
           lymphocyte count was reduced gradually at the rate of 50~100cells/ul/year. When the CD4&#xD;

        -  Immunity 1 (Fuzheng 1) is composed of herbs which have tonic and detoxific function. The&#xD;
           long-term clinical application has proved the safety and effect. It can improve the&#xD;
           symptoms and signs in AIDS patients with the effective rate of 70% and can significantly&#xD;
           improve the quality of life. It can also improve and stabilize immune function and&#xD;
           inhibit viral replication. The basis study have shown that Immunity 1 (Fuzheng 1) can&#xD;
           inhibit viral replication from multi-target, multi-link, enhance immune function,&#xD;
           increase the secretion of IL-2, IFN-γ, participate in immune regulation effect, enhance&#xD;
           NK cell activity, promote CD3+CD4+T cell proliferation and increase macrophage&#xD;
           phagocytes capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Through the clinical trials, we are going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
           Immunity 1 (Fuzheng 1) on immune reconstitution of HIV patients in WHOⅠ、II period.&#xD;
