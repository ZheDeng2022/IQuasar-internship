      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may&#xD;
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to&#xD;
      cancer. It may also help doctors select the best treatment for patients and predict their&#xD;
      response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well tumor tissue testing works&#xD;
      in selecting treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary - Feasibility Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the proportion of consenting patients that can provide a formalin-fixed&#xD;
           paraffin-embedded block containing tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of topoisomerase-1 (topo-1) IHC and K-ras, BRAF mutational&#xD;
           status determination being completed with 10 working days of initial consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine reproducibility of results between reference laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the real costs of molecular testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the patients' ability to comprehend the study and their attitude during the&#xD;
           waiting period for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess patients' ability to fully comprehend the trial as explained to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary - Feasibility Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further identify the EGFR-responsive subset within the K-ras wildtype population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary - Definitive Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic or locally advanced colorectal&#xD;
           cancer and low topo-1-expressing tumors treated with fluorouracil alone versus&#xD;
           irinotecan hydrochloride, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium (IrMdG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients with high topo-1-expressing tumors&#xD;
           treated with oxaliplatin and IrMdG versus IrMdG alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the response rate in patients with K-ras wildtype tumor treated with cetuximab&#xD;
           and IrMdG versus IrMdG alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the response rate in patients with K-ras mutant tumors who are unlikely to&#xD;
           respond to EGFR inhibition treated with bevacizumab and IrMdG versus IrMdG alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, 2-part study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part I (feasibility study): Once consent for tissue block release has been obtained and&#xD;
           patient is registered, the block is requested from the Pathology Department. This begins&#xD;
           the 10 working-day time line. Treatment commences once the results of the testing are&#xD;
           known. The following evaluations are performed during this period:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The frequency of EGFR gene amplification on FISH, PI3K gene mutation, PTEN loss by&#xD;
                IHC, estimation of mRNA for EGFR ligands (amphiregulin and epiregulin), and other&#xD;
                protein assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An evaluation of the impact on the use or further investigation of these markers in&#xD;
                the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients consenting to trial entry and (if agreeable to data collection) patients&#xD;
                refusing trial entry complete a questionnaire assessing patients' ability to fully&#xD;
                comprehend the trial as explained to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients are interviewed before allocation of treatment about their attitudes about&#xD;
                the waiting period necessary for tumor testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part II (definitive study): Patients are stratified according to availability of both&#xD;
           lab tests (K-ras mutation [yes vs no], BRAF mutation [yes vs no], and topoisomerase-1&#xD;
           [topo-1] expression [low vs high]). Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups&#xD;
           based on their biomarker test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1 (low topo-1 and both K-ras and BRAF wildtype): Patients are randomized to 1&#xD;

                     for at least 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
