      The EMC trial investigates for the first time prospectively whether Major Depression Disorder&#xD;
      patients with non-improvement after 14 days of antidepressive treatment with EMC are more&#xD;
      likely to become remitters compared to patients treated according to current guidelines,&#xD;
      i.e., with a medication change after 28 days of treatment in case of non-response.&#xD;
