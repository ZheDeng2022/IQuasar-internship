  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for a series of life threatening diseases&#xD;
      including cancer and heart attack, which causes millions of deaths each year worldwide. Many&#xD;
      of the harmful effects of cigarette smoking can be reversed by quitting; however, due to the&#xD;
      addictive nature of nicotine, quitting smoking is extremely difficult. Despite the efforts,&#xD;
      currently available methods produce only modest smoking cessation rates with relapse.&#xD;
      Previously, tea components were shown to protect effect against cigarette smoke-induced&#xD;
      toxicity. Here the investigator reported an unprecedented smoking cessation effect of tea.&#xD;
      Green tea was made into cigarette filters and tested for its smoking cessation effect in a&#xD;
      double-blind clinical study. The tea filter could effectively achieve abstinence relapse&#xD;
      using smoking process to quite smoking and easy to be used by smoker without any side effects&#xD;
      and psychological obstacles. This work provides a new idea and innovative method to combat&#xD;
      tobacco epidemic. Its implementation and popularization may make a great contribution towards&#xD;
      to reducing the smoking-related diseases, and relieving the public health burden and&#xD;
      pollution caused by cigarette smoking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking has been linked to many life threatening diseases including heart diseases,&#xD;
      cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are about 1.25 billion smokers in the&#xD;
      world. Five million people die every year because of smoking-related diseases. This rate&#xD;
      exceeds many other diseases combined. It is estimated that the global cost for&#xD;
      smoking-related diseases is about $200 billion each year, posing one of the biggest public&#xD;
      human health problems around the world. Many methods have been developed for smoking&#xD;
      cessation by scientists and doctors worldwide. However, due to the addictive nature of&#xD;
      nicotine, quitting smoking is extremely difficult. Despite all the efforts, currently&#xD;
      available smoking cessation methods produce only modest successful rates with relapse. In&#xD;
      addition, they are often not convenient and can lead to a wide variety of side effects.&#xD;
      Therefore, the need of new idea for developing new smoking cessation techniques with better&#xD;
      efficacy and fewer side effects is urgent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological evidences have shown that tea is adversely associated with cancer,&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and other diseases. In addition, we have shown that tea components protect&#xD;
      cells from cigarette smoke-induced toxicity. Recently, we have developed a new cigarette&#xD;
      filter containing tea. While testing the filter for detoxification effects, we found that&#xD;
      several subjects who were smokers decreased their cigarette consumption and subsequently&#xD;
      abstained from cigarette smoking after using the tea filter for a period of time. Animal&#xD;
      experiments revealed that a derivative tea component prevented nicotine addiction similar to&#xD;
      nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) inhibitor. It significantly inhibited the&#xD;
      nicotine-induced expression of alpha4,alpha7 and Î²2 subunits of nAChR and tyrosine&#xD;
      hydroxylase and release of dopamine. This finding encouraged us to recruit more volunteers to&#xD;
      test the smoking cessation effect of the tea filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred healthy male cigarette smokers, aged 18 to 30 years, were screened and 30 of them&#xD;
      were excluded based on the exclusion/inclusion criteria. 70 volunteers were double-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled and randomized into 2 groups (smoking with tea filters or regular&#xD;
      filters). Smoking history, including the nicotine dependence, was assessed at the screening&#xD;
      visit. Exclusion criteria included treatment with an investigational drug within the previous&#xD;
      month; major depression within the prior year; panic disorder, psychosis, or bipolar&#xD;
      disorder; use of nicotine replacement therapy or other drugs within the previous 3 months;&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease; clinically significant medical disease; drug or alcohol abuse or&#xD;
      dependence within the past year; and use of tobacco products other than cigarette smoking&#xD;
      within the previous month. Subjects received brief smoking cessation counseling (up to 10&#xD;
      minutes) at the baseline visit and at each visit afterwards. Self-reported smoking status&#xD;
      since the last visit and exhaled carbon monoxide measurement were assessed at each weekly&#xD;
      visit. Vital signs, weight, and adverse event information were collected at each visit. A&#xD;
      physical examination was performed prior to randomization and at the final visit. Urine and&#xD;
      blood were collected at screening, baseline, and at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 for biochemical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average number of cigarettes consumed daily by one volunteer smoker before the clinic&#xD;
      trial was calculated as control. The average number of cigarettes consumed daily by one&#xD;
      volunteer after the clinic trial was calculated and the numbers were then used to calculate&#xD;
      the averages number of cigarettes consumed daily by one smoker in a week and compared with&#xD;
      control. Continuous abstinence was defined as self-report of no cigarette use during the&#xD;
      specified time period confirmed by an exhaled carbon monoxide measurement of 10 ppm or lower.&#xD;
      To be considered abstinent from smoking during the treatment period, subjects also had to&#xD;
      report that they did not use any other nicotine-containing products. During the follow-up&#xD;
      period, use of nicotine replacement therapy did not disqualify subjects from being considered&#xD;
      abstinent. Subjects who withdrew or were lost to follow-up were assumed to be smokers for the&#xD;
      remainder of the study. The exhaled carbon monoxide was detected by a carbon monoxidemeter&#xD;
      (1209-1 CO, DWYER, USA). Nicotine and cotinine in urine was detected using HPLC (HITACH,&#xD;
      Japan) as reported in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 volunteers in control group and 22 volunteer male cigarette smokers who consumed on&#xD;
      average approximately cigarettes per day, were randomly divided into 2 groups (double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled); smoking with tea filters or with regular filters. After using the tea&#xD;
      filter for 1 month, the average daily cigarette consumption decreased about 43% in the tea&#xD;
      filter group. In contrast, no change in average daily cigarette consumption was detected in&#xD;
      the control group using regular filters. The trial was discontinued for the control group and&#xD;
      the tea filter group was followed for another month. After using the tea filter for 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We then recruited 59 volunteers with longer smoking history and stronger desire for quitting&#xD;
      smoking for smoking cessation test using the tea filter. The subjects were followed for 5&#xD;
      month following the same protocol as described earlier.&#xD;
