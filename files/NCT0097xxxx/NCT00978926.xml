  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The well-established role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in carcinogenesis and&#xD;
      tumor angiogenesis has led to the development of agents that target this pathway. Anti-VEGF&#xD;
      agents the VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, and the small molecule VEGF receptor&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Angiogenic factors play a key role in the maintenance of lung&#xD;
      integrity and normal endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in&#xD;
      hypertension, proteinuria and retinopathy. One of the major issues of anti-VEGF agents is its&#xD;
      long-term toxicity especially taking into account the lack of adequate knowledge in this area&#xD;
      and the possibility of prolonged periods of therapy in non-progressing patients. Hypertension&#xD;
      and proteinuria are commonly seen in patients treated with anti-VEGF agents. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators have also observed in a relatively high frequency of pulmonary air-filled&#xD;
      lesions in patients with malignancy in the lung treated with an anti-VEGF agent. Objectives&#xD;
      of this exploratory study are to 1) determine the effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) on endothelial function 2) determine endothelial dysfunction as a marker of&#xD;
      early response and as an indicator for the development of hypertension and proteinuria 3)&#xD;
      characterize the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on the pulmonary function of patients with&#xD;
      malignancy (primary or secondary) involving the lung in patients treated with anti-VEGF&#xD;
      agents. Pharmacodynamic endpoints to be assessed are: blood pressure, brachial artery&#xD;
      reactivity, retinal microvessels, microalbuminuria and proteinuria, pulmonary function,&#xD;
      assess the effects of anti-VEGF therapy by assessing brachial artery reactivity, retinal&#xD;
      vasculature and pulmonary function in a subset of patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy. The&#xD;
      development of markers of endothelial dysfunction may result in the early identification of&#xD;
      patients who are non-responders or develop toxicity from anti-VEGF treatment.&#xD;

        This study aims to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of anti-VEGF therapy. The following&#xD;
        groups of patients will be approached:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Those who are starting on anti-VEGF therapy (such as but not limited to bevacizumab,&#xD;
        sunitinib, and sorafenib) as part of routine clinical management or on clinical studies&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with measurable pulmonary malignancy (primary or metastatic) as determined by&#xD;
