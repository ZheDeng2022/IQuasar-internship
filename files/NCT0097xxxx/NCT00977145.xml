  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to evaluate 1) the safety of administration of intratumoral&#xD;
      interferon gamma with a peptide-based vaccine, in patients with melanoma and 2) the&#xD;
      biological effects of the vaccine. These include an examination of changes within the tumor&#xD;
      following vaccination and the evaluation of T cell responses to the vaccine both in the blood&#xD;
      and at the sight of tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma vaccines have been associated with major regressions in a small percentage of&#xD;
      patients with advanced measurable disease. This provides proof-of-principle of the potential&#xD;
      for clinical benefit with melanoma vaccines however, the current response rate is low. Thus,&#xD;
      there is a critical need for additional new therapies for melanoma, both for adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      of high-risk resected melanoma and for therapy of patients who are not candidates for, or&#xD;
      fail, other therapies in the setting of advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is generally agreed that one mechanism to improve the immunologic outcomes of vaccine&#xD;
      therapy is to optimize T cell trafficking to the tumor site. CXCR3 is the chemokine receptor&#xD;
      on T cells which directs them to sites of inflammation by following the chemokine gradient.&#xD;
      The ligands for CXCR3 (CXCL9 (MIG), CXCL10 (IP-10) and CXCL11 (I-TAC)) are known to be&#xD;
      induced by interferon gamma. This protocol proposes administering a peptide vaccine to&#xD;
      activate tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells expressing CXCR3, followed by intratumoral&#xD;
      interferon gamma to increase CXCR3 ligands (CXCL9-11) at the tumor site and recruit the&#xD;
      CXCR3+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goals of the proposed work are to assess the safety of the combination of peptide&#xD;
      vaccine and intratumoral interferon gamma and to assess the immunologic outcomes at the tumor&#xD;
      site.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants with stage IIIB, IIIC or IV melanoma. Staging must be confirmed by&#xD;
             cytological or histological examination. Staging of cutaneous melanoma will be based&#xD;
             on the revised AJCC staging system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have adequate cutaneous or subcutaneous metastases of melanoma readily&#xD;
             accessible for biopsy to provide a minimum of 0.3 cm3 of tissue per biopsy&#xD;
             (approximately 0.85 cm by 0.85 cm x 0.85 cm or five 2mm core biopsies) at each time&#xD;
             point. Additionally, at least one of the subcutaneous or cutaneous metastases must be&#xD;
             accessible to intratumoral IFN-gamma administration. Several scenarios may fulfill the&#xD;
             tumor burden requirement. For example, a patient may have one large lesion from which&#xD;
             core biopsies can be taken for the first and second biopsy time points and then the&#xD;
             entire lesion excised for the final tissue sample. Alternatively, a patient may have&#xD;
             three lesions, each ≥0.3 cm3, and these lesions would be excised sequentially as&#xD;
             biopsies 1, 2 and 3. Other combinations are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The intent is to limit this study to patients with cutaneous or subcutaneous melanoma&#xD;
             metastasis rather than lymph node metastasis. There may be cases where a subcutaneous&#xD;
             nodule cannot be definitively characterized as a non-nodal metastasis at the start of&#xD;
             the trial - these patients may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants with ocular, mucosal or unknown primaries and participants with multiple&#xD;
             primaries will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants who have had brain metastases may be eligible in selected circumstances:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients with less than or equal to 3 metastases may eligible as long as the following&#xD;
             3 criteria are true:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The brain metastases have been completely removed by surgery or have been treated&#xD;
                  completely by stereotactic radiotherapy. Stereotactic radiotherapy, such as gamma&#xD;
                  knife, can be used up to 1 week prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There has been no evident growth of any brain metastasis since treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No metastasis greater than 2 cm at the time of protocol entry&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients with greater than 3 metastases may be eligible if the above 3 criteria are&#xD;
             met and if at least one year has elapsed since the last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. All participants must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ability and willingness to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Laboratory parameters - The following laboratory parameters will be required for all&#xD;
             participants. If a lab value appears to be an error or a result of a transient or&#xD;
             treatable condition, the investigator will use his/her clinical judgment to decide if&#xD;
             the test may be repeated. The requirements for inclusion are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, or -A11+&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Participants must have at least one intact (undissected) axillary and/or inguinal&#xD;
             lymph node basin&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had brain metastases unless they meet the criteria outlined above in&#xD;
             the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are currently receiving systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, or&#xD;
             other experimental therapy, or who have received this therapy within the preceding 4&#xD;
             weeks. Gamma knife or stereotactic radiosurgery may be administered within the prior 4&#xD;
             weeks, but must not be administered less than one week prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
             Patients who are currently receiving nitrosoureas or who have received this therapy&#xD;
             within the preceding 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients will not be eligible if there is clinically detectable melanoma deemed likely&#xD;
             by the investigator to require intervention during the first 3 months of the study&#xD;
             that would require premature discontinuation. Examples for such circumstances may&#xD;
             include untreated bone metastases at risk for fracture, and rapidly progressive low&#xD;
             volume disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with known or suspected allergies to any component of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients receiving the following medications at study entry or within the preceding 4&#xD;
             weeks are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agents with putative immunomodulating activity (with the exception of&#xD;
                  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and topical steroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Allergy desensitization injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids, administered parenterally or orally. Inhaled steroids&#xD;
                  (e.g. Advair®, Flovent®, Azmacort®) are not permitted. Topical corticosteroids&#xD;
                  are acceptable, including steroids with very low solubility administered nasally&#xD;
                  for local effects only (e.g. Nasonex®).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any growth factors (e.g. GM-CSF, G-CSF, erythropoietin).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Interferon therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Interleukin-2 or other interleukins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior melanoma vaccinations may be an exclusion criterion in some circumstances:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have recurred or progressed either after or during administration of&#xD;
                  a melanoma vaccine may be eligible to enroll 12 weeks following their last&#xD;
                  vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients may have been vaccinated previously with peptide vaccines (including&#xD;
                  MELITAC 12.1 and similar vaccines) or with non-peptide vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Other investigational drugs or investigational therapy if the patient is currently&#xD;
             taking those drugs/therapy, or if they have received the drugs/therapy within 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnancy or the possibility of becoming pregnant during vaccine administration.&#xD;
             Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
             (urinary or serum beta-HCG) prior to administration of the first vaccine dose. Males&#xD;
             and females must agree, in the consent form, to use effective birth control methods&#xD;
             during the course of vaccination. Women must also not be breast feeding. This is&#xD;
             consistent with existing standards of practice for vaccine and chemotherapy protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients in whom there is a medical contraindication or potential problem in complying&#xD;
             with the requirements of the protocol, in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients classified according to the New York Heart Association classification as&#xD;
             having Class III or IV heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a body weight &lt; 110 lbs because of the amount and frequency with which&#xD;
             blood will be drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participants must not have had prior autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement.&#xD;
             Participants with an active autoimmune disorder requiring these therapies are also&#xD;
             excluded. The following will not be exclusionary:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The presence of laboratory evidence of autoimmune disease (e.g. positive ANA&#xD;
                  titer) without symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical evidence of vitiligo&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other forms of depigmenting illness&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mild arthritis requiring NSAID medications&#xD;
