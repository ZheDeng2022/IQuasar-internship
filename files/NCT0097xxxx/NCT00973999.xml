&#xD;
        1. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           This Randomised Placebo Controlled trial will explore whether Botulinum Toxin injection&#xD;
           into the salivary glands of tracheostomised patients is effective at reducing oral&#xD;
           secretions and frequency of tracheal suctioning. The management of excess saliva ranges&#xD;
           from conservative, such as postural changes and biofeedback to more aggressive such as&#xD;
           medication, surgical and radiological intervention. Studies have shown that the use of&#xD;
           medications, such as glycopyrrolate and scopolamine, are effective in reducing drooling,&#xD;
           but have many adverse side effects, such as excessive dry mouth, constipation, urinary&#xD;
           retention, decreased sweating and skin flushing 1-3. Recent research has shown that the&#xD;
           long-term efficacy of intra-oral surgery for the management of sialorrhea to be&#xD;
           minimally effective and that over two-thirds of patients had recurrence following&#xD;
           surgery resulting in pharmacological or further surgical intervention 4. In contrast&#xD;
           studies using radiation therapy in the management of sialorrhea, have shown initial&#xD;
           satisfactory responses with up to 80% success rate, although there were some reported&#xD;
           side effects, including oral candidiasis and mild skin reactions amongst participants 5&#xD;
&#xD;
           Many studies have investigated the management of sialorrhea (drooling or excessive&#xD;
           salivation) in both Parkinson's disease patients and in children with cerebral palsy,&#xD;
           using Botulinum Toxin injected into the salivary glands 6-8. Several studies report on&#xD;
           the use and efficacy of ultra-sound guided injection versus direct 'blind' injection&#xD;
           into the salivary gland or glands 6 9-11, concluding that blind injections are as&#xD;
           effective as ultra-sound guided injection, when solely injecting into the parotid gland.&#xD;
           However, when injecting into both the parotid and submandibular glands use of guided&#xD;
           injections as well as being a safe and effective technique in the treatment of&#xD;
           sialorrhea 11 12. However to date there has been no application of Botulinum Toxin in&#xD;
           patients who have a tracheostomy in-situ and who require regular tracheal suctioning due&#xD;
           to excessive saliva and / or associated swallowing difficulties. This lack of knowledge&#xD;
           may be of relevance given airway suctioning is associated with clinically significant&#xD;
           complications, such as hypoxia microatelectasis (alveolar damage), laryngospasm and&#xD;
           tracheal wall damage 13. Hooper suggested that the presence of a tracheostomy tube may&#xD;
           cause irritation, resulting in an increased production of sputum 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients have reported sensations of pain, pressure, crushing, choking and gagging,&#xD;
           whereas in the hands of a skill practitioner, suctioning may not be more than a&#xD;
           discomfort 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore a study investigating knowledge and competence in performing tracheal&#xD;
           suctioning in acute and within high dependency ward areas concluded that many staff&#xD;
           members were unaware of recommended practice and a number demonstrated potentially&#xD;
           unsafe practices 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           If ultra-sound guided Botulinum Toxin injection into the parotid and submandibular&#xD;
           salivary glands is shown to be effective in reducing the amount of oral saliva and&#xD;
           subsequently reducing for the need to perform tracheal suctioning, this can ultimately&#xD;
           make tracheal suctioning unnecessary, reduce the time to extubation and normalise&#xD;
           airflow through the larynx. This in turn may normalise swallowing physiology, with the&#xD;
           ultimate outcome of removal of the tracheostomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A reduction in salivary secretions may also significantly reduce the likelihood of&#xD;
           aspiration pneumonia which may have a positive impact on length of stay as well as a&#xD;
           reduction in healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given the wide-range of clinical competencies necessary for the safe and effective&#xD;
           administration of tracheal suctioning, any pharmacologically induced benefit could&#xD;
           attenuate the incidence of secondary complications as well as the likelihood of&#xD;
           associated malpractice litigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The current study will also aid in producing guidelines in the management of saliva in&#xD;
           this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine whether Botulinum Toxin is effective at reducing oral secretions in&#xD;
           tracheotomised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine whether Botulinum Toxin is effective at reducing the frequency of tracheal&#xD;
           suctioning in tracheotomised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To investigate self-perceptions by patients in the management of oral / tracheal&#xD;
           secretions&#xD;
&#xD;
           To investigate nursing perceptions on amount oral secretions and frequency of tracheal&#xD;
           suctioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           The design will be a randomised, placebo-controlled single-blinded experimental study.&#xD;
           Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either active treatment or a&#xD;
           placebo. Randomisation will be performed by matching consecutive eligible patients to a&#xD;
           list of random numbers, generated via a computerised programme, allocating to either&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each participant will be recruited for durations of six weeks in total. The treatment&#xD;
           (injections of Botulinum toxin into the salivary glands) will be given one-week post&#xD;
           after initial baseline measurements have been taken. Each participant will be&#xD;
           followed-up at one week, two weeks and four weeks post injection. The patient will also&#xD;
           continue to be reviewed throughout the study by the Speech and Language Therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine whether Botulinum Toxin is more effective than placebo at reducing oral&#xD;
           secretions, as measured in milligrams at one week, two weeks and at four weeks follow up&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine whether there is a difference in the frequency of tracheal suctioning&#xD;
           performed, across a 12-hour period, between the treatment and placebo controlled group,&#xD;
           as measured by the volume of secretions suctioned at one week, two weeks and four weeks&#xD;
           follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To investigate the self-perceived patient outcomes of amount of oral secretions and&#xD;
           frequency of tracheal suctioning required, using a self-perception questionnaire, to be&#xD;
           completed at one week, two weeks and at four weeks follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To investigate nursing perceptions on the amount of oral secretions and frequency&#xD;
           tracheal suctioning required by individual patients, using a questionnaire, to be&#xD;
           completed at one week, two weeks and at four weeks follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PARTICIPANT ENTRY&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 PRE-RANDOMISATION EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants will be referred to the speech and language therapy department by their&#xD;
           primary Consultant, for assessment of their tracheostomy, communication and / or&#xD;
           swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient will be assessed by the Speech and Language Therapist, using a Clinical&#xD;
           Bedside Evaluation (CBE), as to whether they are able to safely swallow their own saliva&#xD;
           or require tracheal suctioning to assist in clearing secretions that are falling into&#xD;
           their airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrolment&#xD;
           into the study;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           Participants who have a tracheostomy tube in-situ&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants who are breathing on room air, without the need for any mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants who require tracheal suctioning in order to maintain a clear airway&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients presenting with any of the following exclusion criteria will not be included in&#xD;
           the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Contra-indications to the use of Botulinum Toxin&#xD;
&#xD;
           Receiving medications that may react with Botulinum Toxin, such as aminoglycosides&#xD;
           (e.g., gentamicin), anticholinesterase medicines (e.g., neostigmine), lincosamides&#xD;
           (e.g., clindamycin), magnesium, neuromuscular blockers (e.g., atracurium), polymyxin, or&#xD;
           quinidine because the risk of toxic effects may be increased&#xD;
&#xD;
           Receiving anticoagulants medication (e.g., warfarin)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Expectant mothers&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           Swallowing disorders Stroke Myocardial Infarction Heart Disease Head or neck surgery&#xD;
           Acute or progressive neurological disease Structural abnormalities that may affect&#xD;
           swallowing&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be able to withdraw from the study at any time and will continue to&#xD;
           receive therapy intervention / treatment as is required. Subjects may be withdrawn from&#xD;
           the study for any of the following reasons;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Personal reasons: as stated in the informed consent form, subjects may withdraw from the&#xD;
           study at any time&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subject withdraws consent&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical judgement of the Investigator: a subject may be withdrawn from the study, if&#xD;
           the opinion of the Investigator, it is not in the subject's best interest to continue&#xD;
&#xD;
           Loss to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the patient withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of&#xD;
           future information, no further evaluations will be performed and no additional data&#xD;
           collected. The investigator will retain and continue to use any data collected before&#xD;
           such withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Withdrawal due to an adverse event should be distinguished from that due to patient&#xD;
           perceived lack of treatment response or any other reason for withdrawal and recorded on&#xD;
           the appropriate adverse event Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a patient withdraws due to a serious adverse event, the serious adverse event will be&#xD;
           reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined in Section 7,&#xD;
           Pharmacovigilence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. RANDOMISATION AND ENROLMENT PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 RANDOMISATION OR REGISTRATION PRACTICALITIES&#xD;
&#xD;
           From the 40 participants who will be enrolled within the study, 20 will be randomly&#xD;
           assigned to the treatment group and the other 20 will be randomly allocated to the&#xD;
           placebo-control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants will be randomised to either the treatment or placebo-controlled group&#xD;
           using a computerised randomisation generator (www.Randomization.com). This process will&#xD;
           be co-ordinated by the CTO administrator who will advise the Chief Investigator to which&#xD;
           group consecutive participants are allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 UNBLINDING&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants and Nursing staff will be blinded to which group each participant has&#xD;
           been allocated to. In the event where patients become unwell during the study or where&#xD;
           there is a SAE, where the treatment would affect future management, unblinding will&#xD;
           occur and all parties involved in the participants care will be informed as to which&#xD;
           group the participant was allocated, as well as informing the patient and their carers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. TREATMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dr. V P Misra, Consultant Neurophysiologist, will be responsible for prescribing the&#xD;
           study medication, for patients receiving the Botulinum Toxin within the treatment arm of&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1 TREATMENT ARMS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The dosage given is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Botulinum Toxin type-A (Dysport, Ipsen Ltd, Slough, Berkshire) will be reconstituted&#xD;
           with 1.0ml of sodium chloride injection B.P. (0.9%) to yield a solution containing 500&#xD;
           units per ml of Dysport.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each parotid salivary gland will be injected with 75MU of Botulinum Toxin type-A&#xD;
           (Dysport, Ipsen Ltd, Slough, Berkshire), 0.15mls in total, with 0.09mls into the mass of&#xD;
           the gland and another 0.06mls into the adjacent part above the masseter muscle, as&#xD;
           described by Pal 17, using a 1ml syringe and a 30 gauge needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each submandibular salivary gland will be injected with 15MU of Botulinum Toxin A&#xD;
           (Dysport, Ipsen Ltd, Slough, Berkshire), administering 0.03mls, using a 1ml syringe and&#xD;
           a 30 gauge needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each injection will be performed using ultrasound guidance using the Philips iU22&#xD;
           ultrasound system to landmark the site of each of the glands. The drug will be obtained&#xD;
           from Ipsen Ltd and funding application for the drug will be made to Ipsen Ltd, as well&#xD;
           as via The Wellington Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Placebo Participants will receive a pin-pick using a 1ml syringe and a 30 gauge needle,&#xD;
           filled with sodium chloride (0.9%) at the sites of the parotid and submandibular&#xD;
           salivary glands, using ultrasound guidance to landmark the sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2 INTERACTION WITH OTHER DRUGS&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the summary of product characteristics produced by Ipsen limited, drugs&#xD;
           which affect neuromuscular transmission, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, should be&#xD;
           used with caution. Other medications that may interact with Botulinum Toxin are&#xD;
           anticholinesterase medicines (e.g., neostigmine), lincosamides (e.g., clindamycin),&#xD;
           magnesium, neuromuscular blockers (e.g., atracurium), polymyxin, or quinidine because&#xD;
           the risk of toxic effects may be increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.3 DISPENSING AND ACCOUNTABILITY&#xD;
&#xD;
           The shelf-life of Botulinum toxin- type A is 15 months, when stored at a temperature of&#xD;
           2-8oC. The product can be stored for up to 8 hours, following reconstitution at a&#xD;
           temperature of 2-8oC. The drug will be stored with the Wellington Hospitals Pharmacy&#xD;
           department and be prepared by the Consultant Neurophysiologist prior to administration.&#xD;
           Once used, any remaining Botulinum Toxin will be inactivated with dilute hypochlorite&#xD;
           solution and thereafter be disposed of using the hospitals' policy on disposal of unused&#xD;
           drugs; any out-of-date vials of the drug will also be inactivated with dilute&#xD;
           hypochlorite and disposed using the hospitals practice policy on disposal of medication&#xD;
           / drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. PHARMACOVIGILANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.1 DEFINITIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Event (AE):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a&#xD;
           medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this&#xD;
           treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an&#xD;
           abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of&#xD;
           an investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the&#xD;
           IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Reaction (AR):&#xD;
&#xD;
           All untoward and unintended responses to an IMP related to any dose administered. All&#xD;
           AEs judged by either the reporting investigator or the sponsor as having reasonable&#xD;
           causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. The expression&#xD;
           reasonable causal relationship means to convey in general that there is evidence or&#xD;
           argument to suggest a causal relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unexpected Adverse Reaction: an AR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent&#xD;
           with the applicable product information (e.g. investigator's brochure for an unapproved&#xD;
           investigational product or summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for an authorised&#xD;
           product). When the outcome of the adverse reaction is not consistent with the applicable&#xD;
           product information this adverse reaction should be considered as unexpected. Side&#xD;
           effects documented in the SmPC which occur in a more severe form than anticipated are&#xD;
           also considered to be unexpected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Adverse Reaction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose Results in death&#xD;
&#xD;
           Is life-threatening - refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at&#xD;
           the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have&#xD;
           caused death if it were more severe&#xD;
&#xD;
           Requires hospitalisation, or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalisation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
           Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medical judgement should be exercised in deciding whether an AE/AR is serious in other&#xD;
           situations. Important AE/ARs that are not immediately life-threatening or do not result&#xD;
           in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the subject or may require intervention&#xD;
           to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, should also be&#xD;
           considered serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any suspected adverse reaction related to an IMP that is both unexpected and serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.2 CAUSALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Most adverse events and adverse drug reactions that occur in this study, whether they&#xD;
           are serious or not, will be expected treatment-related toxicities due to the drugs used&#xD;
           in this study. The assignment of the causality should be made by the investigator&#xD;
           responsible for the care of the participant using the definitions in the table below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If any doubt about the causality exists the local investigator should inform the study&#xD;
           coordination centre who will notify the Chief Investigators. The pharmaceutical&#xD;
           companies and/or other clinicians may be asked to advise in some cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the case of discrepant views on causality between the investigator and others, all&#xD;
           parties will discuss the case. In the event that no agreement is made, the MHRA will be&#xD;
           informed of both points of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Relationship Description Unrelated There is no evidence of any causal relationship&#xD;
           Unlikely There is little evidence to suggest there is a causal relationship (e.g. the&#xD;
           event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial&#xD;
           medication). There is another reasonable explanation for the event (e.g. the&#xD;
           participant's clinical condition, other concomitant treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Possible There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g. because the event&#xD;
           occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However,&#xD;
           the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g. the participant's&#xD;
           clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Probable There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship and the influence of other&#xD;
           factors is unlikely.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Definitely There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship and other possible&#xD;
           contributing factors can be ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Not assessable There is insufficient or incomplete evidence to make a clinical judgement&#xD;
           of the causal relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.3 REPORTING PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
           All adverse events will be reported. Depending on the nature of the event the reporting&#xD;
           procedures below should be followed. Any questions concerning adverse event reporting&#xD;
           should be directed to the study coordination centre in the first instance. A flowchart&#xD;
           is given below to aid in the reporting procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.3.1 Non serious AR / AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
           All such toxicities, whether expected or not, will be recorded in the toxicity section&#xD;
           of the relevant case report form and sent to the study coordination centre within one&#xD;
           month of the form being due.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.3.2 Serious AR / AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fatal or life threatening SAEs and SUSARs will be reported on the day that the local&#xD;
           site is aware of the event. The SAE form asks for nature of event, date of onset,&#xD;
           severity, corrective therapies given, outcome and causality (i.e. unrelated, unlikely,&#xD;
           possible, probably, definitely). The responsible investigator should sign the causality&#xD;
           of the event. Additional information should be sent within 5 days if the reaction has&#xD;
           not resolved at the time of reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SAEs&#xD;
&#xD;
           An SAE form should be completed and faxed to the study coordination centre for all SAEs&#xD;
           within 24 hours. Please refer to the product SMPC for details of adverse events, if not&#xD;
           included within these guidelines then any adverse effects will be reported to the&#xD;
           Clinical Trials Office&#xD;
&#xD;
           SUSARs&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the case of serious, unexpected and related adverse events, the staff at the site&#xD;
           should:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Complete the SAE case report form &amp; send it immediately (within 24 hours, preferably by&#xD;
           fax), signed and dated to the study coordination centre together with relevant treatment&#xD;
           forms and anonymised copies of all relevant investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Or&#xD;
&#xD;
           Contact the study coordination centre by phone and then send the completed SAE form to&#xD;
           the study coordination centre within the following 24 hours as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study coordination centre will notify the MHRA and REC of all SUSARs occurring&#xD;
           during the study according to the following timelines; fatal and life-threatening within&#xD;
           7 days of notification and non-life threatening within 15 days. All investigators will&#xD;
           be informed of all SUSARs occurring throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Local investigators should report any SUSARs and /or SAEs as required by their Local&#xD;
           Research Ethics Committee and/or Research &amp; Development Office.&#xD;

&#xD;
        8. ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will continue to be followed-up at one week, two week and at four week&#xD;
           intervals post intervention and thereafter as long as they have their tracheostomy tube&#xD;
           in-place and continue to benefit from ongoing intervention from Speech and Language&#xD;
           Therapy for swallowing and / or communication difficulties. Assessment will focus on&#xD;
           weaning from the tracheostomy tube, ability to safely swallow and recordings of tracheal&#xD;
           suctioning and amount of oral saliva. Assessments will also be made of the patients /&#xD;
           carers perceptions of saliva management.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1 LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who may be lost to follow-up will not have their data included and will be&#xD;
           followed-up locally by their local services.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2 TRIAL CLOSURE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will continue to receive Speech and Language Therapy intervention and&#xD;
           ongoing assessment, whilst they remain an inpatient at the hospital. They will be&#xD;
           removed from the trial if and when they are swallowing and managing their own saliva,&#xD;
           without any need for any tracheal suctioning and if the tracheostomy tube is removed.&#xD;
           The end of trial date will be six weeks from inclusion date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           A power calculation has been performed to determine the sample size, which has been&#xD;
           based on previous studies using Botulinum Toxin type A and treatment of drooling /&#xD;
           excessive saliva management.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once entered into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) the data will be&#xD;
           examined for extreme values and transcription errors. Data analysis will commence&#xD;
           following data base lock, which will occur four to six weeks following the last patient&#xD;
           data collection and resolution of all outstanding data queries. Data will be analysed&#xD;
           using Multiple Regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data and all appropriate documentation will be stored for a minimum of 5 years after the&#xD;
           completion of the study, including the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. MONITORING&#xD;
&#xD;
           10.1 RISK ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is considered low risk as this drug dosage has been shown to be a safe and&#xD;
           effective treatment for Parkinson's disease patients with excess saliva (sialorrhea).&#xD;
&#xD;
           10.2 MONITORING AT STUDY COORDINATION CENTRE&#xD;
&#xD;
           During study conduct, HCA's CTO will conduct periodic monitoring visits to the&#xD;
           investigator site to ensure that the protocol and GCP are being followed. The monitors&#xD;
           may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on the CRF is accurate.&#xD;
           The investigator and institution will allow HCA' CTO and appropriate regulatory&#xD;
           authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study site may be subject to quality assurance audits performed by HCA's CTO.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available&#xD;
           during the monitoring visits and audits or inspections and that sufficient time is&#xD;
           devoted to the process.&#xD;
&#xD;

           obtained before the start of the study. The investigators will inform the EC of&#xD;
           subsequent protocol amendments and any serious adverse events which occur during the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11.3 CONSENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           THE INVESTIGATOR OR DELEGATED PHYSICIAN MUST INFORM PATIENTS ABOUT THE BACKGROUND TO,&#xD;
           AND PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMP WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO KNOWN ACTIVITY AND ADVERSE&#xD;
           DRUG REACTION. THE INVESTIGATORS MUST ALSO ENSURE THE FOLLOWING POINTS ARE MADE:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient must be provided with the Patient Information Sheet and Informed Consent&#xD;
           form consistent with the protocol version used and approved by EC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before the patient is entered into the study, the patient's written consent must be&#xD;
           obtained using the Informed Consent form described above (according to HCA SOP&#xD;
           RD.CTS.UK.001). The patient will retain a copy of the signed informed consent form and&#xD;
           the original will be filed in the Trial Master file.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient may refuse treatment either before or at any time during the study. Refusal&#xD;
           to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the patient is&#xD;
           otherwise entitled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An explanation on whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research&#xD;
