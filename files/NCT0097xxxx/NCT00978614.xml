  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effects of ascending repeated-doses of oral [p.o.] neramexane at&#xD;
           therapeutic and supra-therapeutic steady-state doses on cardiac repolarisation (QT/QTc&#xD;
           interval) in healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics [PK] of neramexane and N-OH neramexane (if a validated&#xD;
           method will be available for this metabolite) following repeated daily doses of 50 mg&#xD;
           (steady state), 75 mg (steady state) and 87.5 mg (steady state).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of neramexane 50 mg, 62.5 mg, 75 mg and 87.5 mg&#xD;
           repeated-dose treatments when gradually up-titrated in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the concentration-QT relationship.&#xD;
