  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Shared Health CHRâ„¢ (Clinical Health Record) offers point-of-care clinical reporting and&#xD;
      decision support based primarily on patient claims data aggregated across various health care&#xD;
      settings, and is one example of the types of health information data exchange efforts being&#xD;
      implemented across the country. This study will evaluate how the CHR is used and its clinical&#xD;
      and financial impact to better understand the CHR's value, and to identify opportunities to&#xD;
      enhance the system to support patient care and practice efficiency. In addition, the results&#xD;
      from this study will help to inform the national debate about the effectiveness of these&#xD;
      types of tools to maximize patient quality of care, patient safety, and practice efficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Missing information at the point of care is frustrating for both physicians and patients and&#xD;
      can lead to unnecessary tests or suboptimal or even inappropriate and potentially harmful&#xD;
      treatment. In addition to the risks of poorer quality of care, this fragmentation of&#xD;
      incomplete or unavailable clinical data may result in increased costs to the healthcare&#xD;
      system. Patient health records, when electronically shared across a spectrum of patient care&#xD;
      settings, offer the possibility of improving healthcare outcomes, including patient safety&#xD;
      and quality of care, and increasing efficiency, as well as cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This overall study will consist of two analyses. First, we will conduct a before-and-after,&#xD;
      or pre-post study. The clinical practices consenting to participate will serve as their own&#xD;
      controls during the baseline period. During the baseline period for which data will be&#xD;
      retrospectively captured, physicians will have been conducting &quot;business as usual&quot; without&#xD;
      the use of the CHR. The intervention will consist of participants accessing CHR to assist&#xD;
      with medical decisions and patient care. Secondly, we will conduct a concurrent matched&#xD;
      cohort comparison of patients within practices. We will compare outcomes and gaps in care for&#xD;
      patients whose care is associated with very frequent CHR use and less frequent CHR use to&#xD;
      matched control patients whose care is not associated with CHR use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, quality, and cost outcomes will be compared using the two described approaches.&#xD;
      First, we will compare outcomes and gaps in care for the intervention patients whose care&#xD;
      involved active CHR use in the intervention period to the care these same patients received&#xD;
      during the baseline periods (pre/post analyses). Secondly, we will compare outcomes and gaps&#xD;
      in care of the intervention active patients, both super-active and less active, to the&#xD;
      matched control patients whose care during the study did not involve any CHR use during the&#xD;
      intervention period (matched cohort analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the relationship of CHR use to clinical, financial, and office efficiency&#xD;
      outcomes within the study's timeline, we will limit our study to pre-existing patients and&#xD;
      new patients who have had at least one encounter during the study period. Hospital admission&#xD;
      data will also be analyzed as part of the cost and outcomes analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study the effects of CHR on several conditions among the AHRQ's Ambulatory Care&#xD;
      Sensitive (ACS) Conditions. We will study conditions that are common, high-risk, and resource&#xD;
      dependent where clinical management may be improved with access to a CHR including chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, congestive heart failure, angina/coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, and diabetes mellitus. In addition, other conditions determined to be of value in&#xD;
      evaluating the impact of the CHR may be added, or may replace some of the existing&#xD;
      conditions. These conditions will be chosen based on our early work in the study once we&#xD;
      learn more about the number of eligible patients and the numbers of clinical interactions.&#xD;
      The new conditions, yet to be determined, may also include non-chronic, or acute, diagnoses.&#xD;

        Patients are not being enrolled as subjects; their deidentified data will be reviewed only&#xD;
        if their associated physicians and practices are participating as subjects in the study.&#xD;
        Physicians, staff, and patients within the study population are representative of the&#xD;
        practices we are going to study. Patients' data will be included in the intervention study&#xD;
        to the extent that they are part of Shared Health's CHR system, are receiving care at one&#xD;
        of the selected practices, and meet eligibility requirements.&#xD;
