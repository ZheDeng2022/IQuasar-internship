      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has been used to treat many kinds of cancer&#xD;
           or pre-cancerous conditions that develop in blood or immune system cells. Umbilical cord&#xD;
           blood transplantation (UCBT) is a type of allogeneic transplant that is used when none&#xD;
           of a patient s siblings are a match and an acceptable match cannot be identified from&#xD;
           one of the bone marrow registries. Prior to receiving the cord blood stem cells, large&#xD;
           doses of chemotherapy drugs and/or radiation have been traditionally used to eliminate&#xD;
           most of the cancerous or abnormal cells from the recipient s system, along with most of&#xD;
           his or her own stem cells and immune cells. Donor stem cells then replace the recipient&#xD;
           s stem cells in the bone marrow, restoring normal blood production and immunity. In this&#xD;
           way, an allogeneic SCT provides not only new blood cells but an entire new immune&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the past, allogeneic SCT was performed with very high doses of chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
           radiation to get rid of as much of the recipient s cancer as possible and prevent&#xD;
           rejection of the treatment. However, intensive chemotherapy or radiation can cause&#xD;
           serious side effects, including death. A newer method uses smaller, less toxic doses of&#xD;
           chemotherapy and/or radiation before allogeneic SCT. In these reduced-intensity stem&#xD;
           cell transplants, the recipient s stem cells and immunity are not completely eliminated,&#xD;
           but they are weakened enough to help prevent the donor s cells from being rejected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the safety and effectiveness of reduced-intensity stem cell transplants given with&#xD;
      immune-depleting chemotherapy and umbilical cord blood provided by an unrelated donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 69 years of age who have been diagnosed with any of a number&#xD;
           of cancerous and pre-cancerous blood conditions, including lymphoma and leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must not have a potential donor sibling or a readily available unrelated&#xD;
           donor identified through one of the bone marrow donor registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be matched with at least two umbilical cords with an acceptable cell dose.&#xD;
           The two frozen umbilical cord blood units will be sent to the NIH prior to the date of&#xD;
           transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive one, two, or three cycles of chemotherapy (based on the type of&#xD;
           disease) to treat the disease and to weaken the immune system. Patients who already have&#xD;
           a weakened immune system from other treatments will not receive this round of&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will then receive 4 days of reduced-intensity transplant chemotherapy (also&#xD;
           called the conditioning regimen ) to prepare for the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two days after transplant chemotherapy, patients will receive the transplant, with the&#xD;
           two umbilical cords infused one after the other on the same day. Patients will receive&#xD;
           additional treatment to prevent complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will remain in the hospital for 4 to 6 weeks after the transplant, and will be&#xD;
           discharged for outpatient treatment when the study doctors deem it appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will continue on medications at home to lower the risk of complications and&#xD;
           infections, and will visit the NIH clinic regularly for the first 6 months after the&#xD;
           transplant, and then less often for at least 5 years afterward.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major limitations of umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) in adults are graft&#xD;
      rejection and delayed engraftment leading to increased infection-related morbidity and&#xD;
      treatment related mortality (TRM). To increase engraftment rates while at the same time&#xD;
      enhancing graft-versus-tumor effect, previous studies within our institution have employed&#xD;
      the strategy of targeted immune depletion (TID). The goal of TID is to use T-cell suppressive&#xD;
      chemotherapy prior to the conditioning regimen to treat the patient s disease while&#xD;
      concurrently depleting host T-cells. This has lead to earlier complete donor chimerism in the&#xD;
      setting of allogeneic sibling donor and matched unrelated donor transplantation. Our aim in&#xD;
      the current protocol is to extend the strategy of TID to reduced-intensity UCBT, with the&#xD;
      goal of more rapid engraftment, leading to decreased TRM and increased overall survival. Our&#xD;
      intention is to investigate this approach in the setting of double cord blood transplant in&#xD;
      adults in a pilot manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of this study is to see whether targeted immune depletion can&#xD;
           shorten the time to neutrophil recovery and improve the cord blood engraftment rate as&#xD;
           measured by ANC greater than or equal to 500 x 3 and at least partial donor chimerism&#xD;
           (10-90%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives include further assessment of hematopoetic recovery, treatment&#xD;
           related morbidity including infections and acute and chronic GVHD, TRM, progression free&#xD;
           and overall survival, further assessment of immune reconstitution, and study of&#xD;
           engraftment kinetics as they apply to prediction of which of the two transplanted cords&#xD;
           will engraft in relation to cell dose, CD34+ dose, HLA-match, and other experimental&#xD;
           variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults (18-69 years) with advanced or high-risk hematologic malignancies including AML,&#xD;
           ALL, MDS, CLL, NHL, HL, CML, multiple myeloma, and MPD who lack a readily available&#xD;
           HLA-matched sibling or greater than or equal to 7/8 HLA-matched unrelated donor.&#xD;
           Patients must have life expectancy of at least 3 months, ECOG less than or equal to 2,&#xD;
           and relatively normal major organ functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have two partially HLA-matched UCB units. Units must be HLA-matched at&#xD;
           HLA-A and B (intermediate resolution molecular typing) and DRB1 (high resolution&#xD;
           molecular typing) 4-6/6 with the recipient and 4-6/6 with each other. Each unit must&#xD;
           contain a minimum precryopreserved, nucleated cell dose of 1.5 x 10(7) per kilogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Pilot study of TID in the setting of reduced-intensity double cord blood&#xD;
           transplant in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive disease-specific induction chemotherapy (EPOCH-F/R or FLAG) prior&#xD;
           to transplant for disease control and immune depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive an identical conditioning regimen consisting of&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide 1200 mg/m(2)/day IV for 4 days and fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day for 4&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A maximum of 13 patients will be transplanted in the initial part of this pilot study.&#xD;
           If no stopping rules are reached, the study will be expanded to allow the&#xD;
           transplantation of an additional 12 patients (a total of 25 patients).&#xD;
