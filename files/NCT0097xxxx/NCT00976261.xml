  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Part A of this study is to test whether repeated doses of the study drug&#xD;
      (GSK1614235) are safe and well tolerated (i.e. do not produce unacceptable side effects) and&#xD;
      whether we can obtain some preliminary information as to whether it works in lowering blood&#xD;
      glucose levels. We will do this by comparing the effect of the study drug with placebo (no&#xD;
      drug present) and against a drug (sitagliptin) known to control blood glucose in the&#xD;
      treatment of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of Part B of this study is to determine the how the timing of dosing, relative to&#xD;
      meals, affects the response to study drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, dose-ranging study, in subjects with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus to assess safety, tolerability, and to estimate the pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      effects when subjects receive repeated doses of placebo, sitagliptin (Januvia), or&#xD;
      GSK1614235. The target is to explore the best doses of GSK1614235 that provide glucose&#xD;
      control with minimal adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be at least 4 cohorts of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 8 subjects randomized to receive placebo, 100mg sitagliptin QD, or 1mg&#xD;
           GSK1612435 BID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 6 subjects randomized to receive placebo, 100mg sitagliptin QD, or 5mg&#xD;
           GSK1612435 BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: 6 subjects randomized to receive placebo, 100mg sitagliptin QD, or 20mg&#xD;
           GSK1612435 BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: 20-40 subjects randomized to receive placebo, 100mg sitagliptin QD, or&#xD;
           GSK1612435 BID, (potential doses of 0.25 to 40mg BID), depending on safety,&#xD;
           tolerability, and glucose results of Cohorts 1, 2, and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 5: 12 subjects randomized to receive placebo or GSK1614235 BID (potential doses&#xD;
           of up to 80mg BID), depending on safety, tolerability, and glucose results of Cohorts 1,&#xD;
           2, 3, and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 6: 24 subjects randomized to receive GSK1614235 BID (20BID), or sitagliptin&#xD;
           (100mg QD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subjects have successfully completed the screening procedures, they will be asked to&#xD;
      discontinue prior anti-diabetic therapy at least 72 h before admission to the research&#xD;
      facility and remain off of the medications until the completion of the follow-up visit (total&#xD;
      of ~14 days). Subjects will be admitted to the research facility on the evening of Day -2 in&#xD;
      preparation to begin baseline assessments, including PD, on Day -1 (for their particular&#xD;
      cohort). Beginning on Day 1, subjects will receive a single dose of GSK1614235 and undergo PK&#xD;
      sampling, and on Day 2 through Day 6, subjects will be dosed on a twice daily dosing schedule&#xD;
      with doses administered immediately before breakfast and the evening meal. Day 6 includes&#xD;
      intensive assessments of PK and PD parameters in addition to routine safety monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a double-blind, randomized, single-dose, 3-way crossover study in 12 subjects. A&#xD;
      well-tolerated dose of GSK1614235 that provides a meaningful pharmacodynamic response based&#xD;
      on data from Part A will be administered in both fed and fasted states. It is not anticipated&#xD;
      that the dose for Part B will exceed single doses of 40mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will consist of 3 periods. Period 1 will begin after subjects have successfully&#xD;
      completed screening. They will be admitted to the research facility the evening before dosing&#xD;
      (Day -1) and will dose the following morning after an overnight (at least 12 hour fast).&#xD;
      Safety monitoring and PK and PD sampling will be conducted over a 48 hour period. Subjects&#xD;
      will be discharged from the research facility after the 48 hour PK and PD sample has been&#xD;
      collected. A washout period of â‰¥ 5 days period will ensue, and subjects will be admitted to&#xD;
      the research facility to begin Period 2. Period 3 will follow the same schedule as Period 1&#xD;
      and Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized such that, at separate admissions, each subject receives the&#xD;
      selected GSK1614235 dose or matching placebo as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GSK1614235 before meal and placebo after meal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GSK1614235 30 min after meal and placebo before meal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo - both before meal and 30 min after meal&#xD;
