      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patellofemoral pain syndrome is one of the most common knee problems. It is&#xD;
           characterized by pain in the front of the knee that is aggravated by deep knee flexion,&#xD;
           prolonged sitting, and repetitive movement. The most widely accepted theory regarding&#xD;
           the source of this pain is that a force imbalance around the knee puts extra stress on&#xD;
           the area, leading to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in learning more about the muscle groups around the knee to&#xD;
           better understand the causes of knee pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To obtain more information on how muscles, tendons, and bones work together to cause motion&#xD;
      in the knee, both in the normal state and after immobilizing certain muscles around the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy individuals between the ages of 18 and 55, who have no current or chronic muscle,&#xD;
      bone, or joint problems and who have no implants or other problems that would prevent them&#xD;
      from receiving a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol will be carried out over two visits, both of which will involve using&#xD;
           standard MRI sequences to look at the knee at rest and in motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first part will examine the knee under its natural state, with a standard MRI scan&#xD;
           of the knee both at rest and in motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second part will involve temporarily reducing the force producing capabilities of&#xD;
           one of the extensor muscles in the knee. To do so, study doctors will inject lidocaine&#xD;
           into the muscle, which will temporarily (for approximately 2 hours) block the force&#xD;
           producing capacity of this muscle, and then perform the MRI scan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain syndrome is one of the most common problems of the knee. It is&#xD;
      characterized by anterior knee pain that is aggravated by deep knee flexion, prolonged&#xD;
      sitting, and repetitive flexion/extension. The most widely accepted theory in regards to the&#xD;
      source of this pain is that a force imbalance around the knee leads to static patellofemoral&#xD;
      malalignment and dynamic patellofemoral maltracking. In turn, this malalignment and&#xD;
      maltracking lead to elevated joint contact stresses, which ultimately leads to patellofemoral&#xD;
      pain. Current understanding of patellofemroal maltracking is typically focused on static 2D&#xD;
      alignment (lateral tilt and displacement). Yet, patellofemoreal pain is most often&#xD;
      exacerbated during dynamic events and the patella has complete six degrees of freedom in its&#xD;
      movement. More recent studies have been able to quantify patellofemoral kinematics during&#xD;
      volitional dynamic tasks and demonstrate that the maltracking problem is more complex than&#xD;
      originally postulated. Specifically, in patients with patellofemoral pain, altered kinematics&#xD;
      are not limited to excessive patellar lateral translation and tilt, but include excessive&#xD;
      patellar superior translation along with excessive flexion and varus rotation. Although these&#xD;
      results are useful in demonstrating how specific maltracking patterns could lead to&#xD;
      patellofemoral pain, they do not present any associations between a potentially altered force&#xD;
      balance around the knee and the observed maltracking patterns. Therefore, the overall goal of&#xD;
      this work is to determine the specific sources of maltracking patterns in patellofemoral&#xD;
      pain. As part of this overall goal, the purpose of this study is to determine how the loss of&#xD;
      force in the vasti medialis muscle alters the dynamic control of patellar kinematics.&#xD;

        Subjects for this study will be recruited through the Patient Recruitment and Public&#xD;
        Liaison (PRPL) office. PRPL will respond to clinical research study inquiries, conduct&#xD;
        preliminary screening for the protocol, and refer prospective patients to the Protocol&#xD;
