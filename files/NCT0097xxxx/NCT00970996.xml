      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Abraxane&#xD;
      (nab-paclitaxel) when given in combination with cisplatin, Temodar (temozolomide), interferon&#xD;
      alfa-2b, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) to patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of the Phase I is to determine the toxicity, safety and the&#xD;
           maximum tolerated dose maximum tolerated dose of Abraxane in combination with Cisplatin,&#xD;
           Temozolomide, interleukin-2 and interferon a2b in patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess responses to the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the duration of response and the overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effectiveness in delaying the appearance of Central Nervous System&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and temozolomide are chemotherapy drugs and have a direct effect&#xD;
      on melanoma cells. Interferon alfa-2b and IL-2 are biotherapy drugs that stimulate the immune&#xD;
      system to fight against melanoma. The combination of chemotherapy and biotherapy drugs is&#xD;
      called biochemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study using these drugs in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have a central venous&#xD;
      catheter (CVC) inserted, if you do not already have one. The catheter is passed through the&#xD;
      veins of your arm or the veins that run under your collar bone to reach a wide central vein&#xD;
      in the chest that runs above your heart. You will receive a separate consent form for this&#xD;
      procedure, which describes the risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and interleukin-2 are given through this catheter. In certain&#xD;
      situations, blood can also be drawn from this catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a dose level of nab-paclitaxel based on when you joined this study.&#xD;
      Up to 3 dose levels of nab-paclitaxel will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each&#xD;
      new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects&#xD;
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of nab-paclitaxel that can be&#xD;
      given in combination with the other drugs is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of temozolomide, cisplatin, interferon&#xD;
      alfa-2b, and IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle will last 3-5 weeks. The length of each cycle will depend on your recovery&#xD;
      from the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take temozolomide by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive nab-paclitaxel over about 30 minutes by vein about 1 hour after you&#xD;
           take temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will then receive cisplatin by vein. Each infusion of cisplatin will take about&#xD;
           45-120 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive interferon alfa-2b by injection into fatty tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will begin your IL-2 infusion. The infusion will begin after you receive cisplatin&#xD;
           and will continue non-stop until Day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take temozolomide by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive cisplatin by vein about 1 hour after you take temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive interferon alfa-2b by injection into fatty tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 3 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take temozolomide by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive cisplatin by vein about 1 hour after you take temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive interferon alfa-2b by injection into fatty tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (up to 4 teaspoons total) will be drawn for routine tests and tests to check for&#xD;
           infection in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 4 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive cisplatin by vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive interferon alfa-2b by injection into fatty tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (up to 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 5 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive nab-paclitaxel by vein over about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive interferon alfa-2b by injection into fatty tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (up to 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on how your body reacts to the study drugs, you will stay in the hospital for 7 or&#xD;
      more days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you are discharged from the hospital, blood (up to 4 teaspoons) will be drawn 2 times a&#xD;
      week for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting each cycle of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood&#xD;
           counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After every 2 cycles of treatment, you will have CT scans and an MRI scan of the brain to&#xD;
      check the status of the disease. If you have disease in the bone, you will have a PET/CT to&#xD;
      check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have skin lesions, you will have them photographed to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 6 cycles of the study drugs. You will be taken off study early if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Contact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are having follow-up visits with a doctor who is not at M. D. Anderson, you will be&#xD;
      called 2-4 times a year to learn what treatments you may be receiving and how are you doing.&#xD;
      You will continue to receive these calls for as long as possible. The phone calls will take&#xD;
      about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Nab-paclitaxel is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      for breast cancer. Temozolomide is FDA approved and commercially available for brain cancer.&#xD;
      Cisplatin is FDA approved and commercially available for testicular, ovarian, and bladder&#xD;
      cancers. Interferon is FDA approved and commercially available for patients with melanoma who&#xD;
      are having surgery. IL-2 is FDA approved and commercially available for melanoma and kidney&#xD;
      cancer. The combination of these drugs is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 patients will be take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
