      The study aims investigating the safety profile of Artequin Paediatric in a 3-day treatment&#xD;
      of children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria under &quot;real life conditions&quot; in West&#xD;
      Africa. Important parameters, such as concomitant medication, the patient's medical history&#xD;
      and diseases, differential WBC counts, the presence of parasitaemia as well as the patient's&#xD;
      compliance are evaluated. Detailed recording of possible AEs and SAEs enable additionally an&#xD;
      assessment of the safety and effectiveness of Artequin Paediatric over a period of 63 days&#xD;
      following treatment initiation. The present study primarily serves to detect and assess&#xD;
      possible neuropsychiatric and neurological events in young children using a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire and axamination.&#xD;
