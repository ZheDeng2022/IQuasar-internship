      This study is to find out about whether two sessions of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy are&#xD;
      safe and will help people who are anxious as a result of having stage IV melanoma and will&#xD;
      involve two sessions of psychotherapy combined with either 4 or 25 mg psilocybin. The study&#xD;
      will measure anxiety, depression, quality of life and spirituality before and after&#xD;
      psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, natural killer cells (a type of immune cell) will be&#xD;
      counted from blood samples taken the day after psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, and people&#xD;
      will keep daily diaries reporting on how anxious they feel for each day in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is a cancer arising from pigment-producing cells, or melanocytes. These cells are&#xD;
      chiefly located in the skin, but they can also be found in other parts of the body, including&#xD;
      eyes, ears and GI tract. A diagnosis of stage IV melanoma can create great stress and anxiety&#xD;
      for an individual and his or her caregivers. Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-&#xD;
      N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine) is a psychedelic (hallucinogenic) compound found in certain species&#xD;
      of mushrooms that can produce spiritual or mystical experiences and that has been used in&#xD;
      psychotherapy prior to being made illegal. This study will be a randomized, active-placebo&#xD;
      controlled pilot study of the safety and efficacy of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy as a&#xD;
      means of managing anxiety in association with stage IV melanoma. This study will examine&#xD;
      whether two sessions of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy scheduled seen to 14 days apart&#xD;
      will reduce anxiety, improve quality of life and be safe in people with stage IV melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in this study will have a 66% chance of receiving the full dose of 25 mg psilocybin&#xD;
      and a 33% of receiving 4 mg psilocybin. The first dose is expected to change how people feel,&#xD;
      think and see the world, while the lower dose is expected to have only slight effects. Each&#xD;
      subject will receive these conditions at random, as if by coin-toss. The researchers,&#xD;
      including the therapists, and the subject will not know whether they are assigned to get 25&#xD;
      or 4 mg psilocybin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study can last up to three and a half months (14 weeks) but the main part of the&#xD;
      study lasts six weeks. After the researchers determine that a person with stage IV melanoma&#xD;
      and anxiety can be in the study, there will be two introductory psychotherapy sessions with&#xD;
      the therapist-investigators. They will prepare the participant for psilocybin-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy. The subject will have a day-long psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy session&#xD;
      after introductory sessions, and he or she will remain overnight at the clinic. There will be&#xD;
      a psychotherapy follow-up scheduled the day after each psilocybin-assisted session to help&#xD;
      people work with the psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, and there will be a psychotherapy&#xD;
      session in between the first and second psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy sessions. Two weeks&#xD;
      after the second psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy session, subjects will return for another&#xD;
      follow-up visit. The subjects will answer questions or fill out questionnaires about anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, quality of life, spirituality and sense of self at the start of the study, two&#xD;
      weeks after the second psilocybin-assisted session and at least once during the study.&#xD;
      Subjects will have blood draws to assess liver function before each psilocybin-assisted&#xD;
      session and they will have a blood draw to assess natural killer (NK) cells the day after&#xD;
      each psilocybin-assisted session. On the day after each psilocybin-assisted session, subjects&#xD;
      will also complete a questionnaire about their experiences during the psilocybin-assisted&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after the second experimental psilocybin-assisted session, subjects will learn if&#xD;
      they got the full or active placebo dose of psilocybin. Any of the three subjects who receive&#xD;
      the active placebo dose can take part in an &quot;open-label&quot; study phase that will last another&#xD;
      six weeks. The open-label phase will be nearly identical to those used in the first study&#xD;
      phase except that there will be one, and not two, introductory psychotherapy sessions, and&#xD;
      the subject and therapists will know that the subject will be receiving 25 mg psilocybin.&#xD;
      People who got the full dose of 25 mg psilocybin will not take part in the open-label study&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they are well enough to do so, subjects who received the full dose of psilocybin will have&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, quality of life and spirituality measured again two months after the&#xD;
      second experimental session. Subjects who received active placebo psilocybin will have&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, quality of life and spirituality measured two months after the second&#xD;
      open-label psilocybin-assisted session.&#xD;
