    <textblock>
      This is the first time NOX-A12 will be administered to man. The principal aim of this study&#xD;
      is to obtain safety and tolerability data when NOX-A12 is administered by single intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) doses to healthy male and female subjects. This information, together with the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, will help establish the doses and dosage regimen of&#xD;
      administration suitable for subsequent studies in the patient population.&#xD;
