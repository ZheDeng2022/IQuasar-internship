    <textblock>
      Seniors 65 years of age and older represent one of the fastest growing segments of society&#xD;
      with the population doubling within the next 25 years with dramatic rates of mental decline,&#xD;
      costing society billions of dollars each year. The proposed research seeks to discover&#xD;
      whether relatively short term mental or physical training can enhance gist reasoning,&#xD;
      generalize to untrained cognitive areas and modify/strengthen brain function in areas&#xD;
      susceptible to aging processes. To identify neuroprotective and non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions to prevent mental decline and maximize cognitive brain health during the course&#xD;
      of the adult lifespan has major public policy implications.&#xD;

      Background: A significant potential exists to modify the structure and function of the aging&#xD;
      human brain given intensive mental stimulation and physical activity. Age-related cognitive&#xD;
      decline has consistently been identified on frontal lobe measures of executive control such&#xD;
      as reasoning. Concomitantly, a greater vulnerability of frontal brain networks, which&#xD;
      subserve executive control functions, has also been identified with aging. Preliminary&#xD;
      evidence highlights the potential of reasoning training as well as physical training to&#xD;
      modify and strengthen brain and cognitive function in seniors. Evidence from our lab&#xD;
      indicates that frontally mediated, gist-based reasoning (defined as the ability to combine&#xD;
      detail information to construct abstract meanings) offers a promising cognitive domain to&#xD;
      train. Extracting gist meaning from the massive amount of incoming information is one of the&#xD;
      most vital mental skills a healthy mind achieves. Purpose: This proposal is an innovative&#xD;
      study to obtain data regarding the benefits of a (a) novel gist-based reasoning training&#xD;
      program or (b) physical training on frontal-lobe mediated cognitive measures of executive&#xD;
      control in cognitively normal seniors. The project will also employ newly developed (a) brain&#xD;
      measures to chart changes in brain blood flow and connectivity combined with (b) a cognitive&#xD;
      activation task specifically designed to measure brain regions engaged in gist reasoning&#xD;
      versus detail processing. The project also examines shorter dose effects, i.e. after 6 weeks&#xD;
      and 12 weeks, than previously examined as well as individual differences based on high and&#xD;
      low performers for gist and physical training. Methods: 60 cognitively normal seniors between&#xD;
      the ages of 60 and 75 years will be recruited for study and randomized into 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
      Each group will consist of 20 participants each: a reasoning-trained, a physical-trained and&#xD;
      a wait-listed control group. Participants will be comprehensively screened to insure they are&#xD;
      cognitively normal. Prior to intervention, participants' baseline gist and detail processing&#xD;
      ability, battery of cognitive functions and fitness measures will be obtained. Structural and&#xD;
      functional brain measures will also be obtained. Participants will undergo 12 weeks of&#xD;
      gist-based training or physical training with measurement at midpoint, 6 weeks of training,&#xD;
      endpoint 12 weeks of training and 4 weeks after training is completed. Training effects will&#xD;
      be measured behaviorally in trained areas (reasoning &amp; physical) and untrained cognitive&#xD;
      areas. Additionally, structural and functional brain imaging will measure changes in cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow, global and regional brain volume, white matter tracts, efficiency, activation&#xD;
      patterns, and blood oxygenation with a particular focus on changes to frontal regions.&#xD;
      Significance: The current study seeks to discover neuroprotective, nonpharmacological&#xD;
      interventions that could prevent mental decline and strengthen cognitive brain health in&#xD;
      seniors, with possible societal savings of billions of dollars. This will be one of the first&#xD;
      training studies to explore short-term intensive reasoning and physical training, each&#xD;
      documented as pivotal to cognitive brain health with the potential to strengthen frontal&#xD;
      regions against the losses associated with aging.&#xD;
