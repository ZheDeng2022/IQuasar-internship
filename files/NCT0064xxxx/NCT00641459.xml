  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to obtain the current status of patients with&#xD;
      Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia. This study is also expected to further&#xD;
      provide insight into the evolution of behavioral and psychotic symptoms and its relationship&#xD;
      with treatment as well as severity of cognitive declines in a naturalistic setting.&#xD;

      This is an observational, prospective, multi-center study to obtain information about the&#xD;
      symptoms and treatment received for patients with behavioral and psychological symptoms of&#xD;
      dementia (BPSD). Patients must first meet eligibility criteria and sign informed consent.&#xD;
      Patient treatment will be based upon investigator opinion. The following parameters will be&#xD;
      assessed: patient's characteristics, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score, Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Inventory (NPI), and Minimal Mental Status Examination (MMSE). Each patient will be observed&#xD;
      for 12 weeks. Medication dosing regimen will be flexible throughout the study and is based on&#xD;
      patient response and investigator judgment. During the study observation period, all patients&#xD;
      will attend clinic visits for the subsequent 12 weeks (visit 2 to 3) as is the usual clinical&#xD;
      practice. Patients can visit clinics on additional dates as needed or by request. At the&#xD;
      pre-planned clinic visits, CGI score, NPI, vital signs, reports of adverse events, drug&#xD;
      information, and MMSE score (visit 3) will be recorded. This is an observational study and no&#xD;
      study drug is administered.&#xD;
