      RATIONALE: Classical chemotherapy does not cure advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)&#xD;
      despite new drugs. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 surface antigen&#xD;
      on B lymphocytes and leads to apoptosis of CD20 positive B lymphocytes. The highest response&#xD;
      rate yet published in the treatment of first-line CLL has been obtained by the association of&#xD;
      fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). Now, the question is whether this response&#xD;
      can be improved, as some trials showed that eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD) in&#xD;
      CLL is associated with a longer treatment-free and overall survival. Maintenance therapy&#xD;
      using rituximab has been recently approved as a means of prolonging remission in patients&#xD;
      with indolent non Hodgkin's lymphoma. Maintenance therapy with rituximab could be of interest&#xD;
      in treatment of MRD in CLL and prolonging remission and survival times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: The overall purpose of the study is to determine the value of immunotherapy&#xD;
      maintenance with single agent rituximab in comparison with no further treatment (observation&#xD;
      ) for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in elderly (&gt;65 years) patients who&#xD;
      respond to induction immunochemotherapy with FCR.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate superiority, in terms of 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), of&#xD;
           rituximab maintenance over observation in patients who are in complete or partial&#xD;
           response (CR or PR) after induction therapy comprising fludarabine, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
           and rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine event-free survival, disease-free survival, overall survival, and time to&#xD;
           next treatment, all from time of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine overall response rate (CR and PR) according to NCI and iwCLL criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the rate of phenotypic response (minimal residual disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess duration of phenotypic and NCI and iwCLL clinical responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine response rates and time-related parameters in biological subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine rates of treatment-related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate CD4/CD8 counts, immunoglobulin levels, and incidence of Coombs-positive&#xD;
           hemolytic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study pharmacokinetics of rituximab during induction and maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the prognostic impact of the immunoglobulin FcÎ³RIIIA genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study pharmacoeconomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Randomization is stratified according to response to&#xD;
      induction therapy (complete response [CR] vs partial response [PR]), IGHV mutational status,&#xD;
      and 11q deletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1 and 14 of courses 1-2 and on day 1 of courses 3 and&#xD;
      4. Patients also receive oral fludarabine and oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 2-4 of&#xD;
      course 1 and on days 1-3 of courses 2-4. Courses are administered every 28 days. Patients&#xD;
      achieving CR or PR are randomized 1:1 to maintenance arm or observation arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Patients receive rituximab IV every 2 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum duration of 24 months (12 infusions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Patients undergo observation only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then&#xD;
      every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
