    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SNX-5422 is an experimental drug that inhibits a protein called Hsp90, which is important for&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SNX-5422 has shown some activity against tumors in the laboratory and animal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the highest safe dose, or maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of SNX-5422 that can&#xD;
      safely be given to patients with solid tumor cancers and lymphomas when taken twice a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how the body's blood and tissue cells react to SNX-5422.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effects of SNX-5422 on tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older who have solid tumor cancers or lymphomas that do not&#xD;
      respond to standard therapy or for whom no acceptable standard treatment is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SNX-5422 is taken by mouth twice a week in 28-day cycles. Treatment may continue as long as&#xD;
      the cancer does not worsen and side effects are acceptable. Three to six patients are&#xD;
      enrolled in the study at a time. Each group is given a higher dose of SNX-5422 than the&#xD;
      previous, as long as the preceding dose was tolerated and until the MTD is determined. When&#xD;
      the MTD is found, six more patients are enrolled at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period, patients undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic visits for a physical examination each treatment cycle to check on health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for routine laboratory values, to determine how the body handles SNX-5422,&#xD;
           and to examine the effects of SNX-5422 on blood cells and other targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine tests as needed, depending on the results of blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scans, or other imaging tests every 8 weeks to evaluate the tumor response to&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy (surgical removal of a tissue sample for examination under a microscope)&#xD;
           before the first dose of SNX-5422 and again 24 hours after the first dose to see how the&#xD;
           drug affects the tumor. This test is optional.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inhibitors of the chaperone protein Hsp90 are of current interest because of the central&#xD;
           role that Hsp90 plays in the maturation and maintenance of numerous proteins, such as&#xD;
           Her2, critical for tumor cell viability and growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disruption of Hsp90 function has been shown to cause degradation of multiple Hsp90&#xD;
           client proteins, leading to inhibition of several key signaling pathways. This in turn&#xD;
           results in inhibition of cellular proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SNX-5422 when administered twice a week&#xD;
           for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the safety profile of SNX-5422 when administered twice a week for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the effects of SNX-5422 on Hsp90 client proteins using pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
           assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the effects of SNX-5422 on tumor and lymphoma response using the National&#xD;
           Cancer Institute (NCI) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria)&#xD;
           and standardized lymphoma criteria, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SNX-2112 and its prodrug SNX-5422 in&#xD;
           humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically documented solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies (lymphoma&#xD;
           and CLL) whose disease has progressed following standard therapy, or who have no&#xD;
           acceptable standard treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with no major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
           enrollment, and who have recovered from toxicities from prior therapies to at least&#xD;
           eligibility levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a Phase I dose escalation study to determine the MTD and recommended Phase II&#xD;
      dose of SNX-5422. SNX-5422 will be administered orally twice a week for 28 days in continuous&#xD;
      cycles until disease progression occurs or the patient meets off-study criteria. Three to six&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled at each dose level, and up to 6 additional patients at the MTD, for&#xD;
      a minimum of up to 36 patients and a maximum of 60 patients.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with histologically documented (by the NIH pathology department) solid tumors and&#xD;
        lymphoid malignancies (lymphoma and CLL) who are refractory to standard therapy or who have&#xD;
        no acceptable standard treatment options. Patients with lymphoid malignancies will be&#xD;
        eligible if their disease has progressed following 2 standard therapies (aggressive NHL),&#xD;
        and if their disease is considered refractory (for indolent NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have recovered to at least Grade less than or equal to1 toxicity levels due&#xD;
        to adverse events and/or toxicity of prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy. They must not&#xD;
        have had chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study (6&#xD;
        weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C, or UCN-01). Patients must be greater than or equal&#xD;
        to 2 weeks since any prior administration of study drug in an exploratory IND/Phase Zero&#xD;
        study. Patients must be greater than or equal to 1 month since any prior radiation or major&#xD;
        surgery. However, patients receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen&#xD;
        deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2&#xD;
        (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Life expectancy greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have normal or adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/milliliter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/milliliter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin* within less than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of&#xD;
             normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        - creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min (measured) for patients with&#xD;
        creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        *we will allow patients with Gilbert's syndrome with total bilirubin up to 2.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of SNX-5422 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women&#xD;
        of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
        barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of&#xD;
        study participation, and for 2 months after discontinuation from the study. Women of&#xD;
        childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test in order to be eligible. Should&#xD;
        a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
        should inform her treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
        risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
        SNX-5422, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with SNX-5422.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients receiving any other investigational agents. Patients with symptomatic brain&#xD;
        metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and&#xD;
        because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the&#xD;
        evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. However, patients who have had treatment&#xD;
        for their brain metastases and whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable&#xD;
        for at least 3 months without steroids may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
        investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled medical illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or uncontrolled,&#xD;
        symptomatic congestive heart failure (AHA Class II or worse), uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
        unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
        would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are excluded from the&#xD;
        study because of possible PK interactions with SNX-5422. HIV positive patients not&#xD;
        receiving antiretroviral therapy are excluded due to the possibility that SNX-5422 may&#xD;
        worsen their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may obscure the&#xD;
        attribution of adverse events with respect to SNX-5422.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Chronic diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Gastrointestinal diseases that could affect drug absorption, including postsurgical states&#xD;
        such as gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Gastrointestinal diseases that could alter the assessment of safety, including irritable&#xD;
        bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or hemorrhagic coloproctitis.&#xD;
