    <textblock>
      Phase IIa, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multi-centre study in&#xD;
      subjects diagnosed with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The primary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the effects of 12-weeks of treatment with GW856553 7.5 mg twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) compared with placebo on the percentage of sputum neutrophils at 12 weeks. Twelve&#xD;
      weeks of treatment with SERETIDE 50/500 BID will be compared with placebo for effect on&#xD;
      sputum neutrophils as a positive control arm in the study&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects eligible for enrolment in the study must meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male adults or female adults of non-childbearing potential who are between 40 and 75&#xD;
             years of age (inclusive). Note: a female is eligible to enter and participate in the&#xD;
             study if she is of non-childbearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant). This includes any female who is post-menopausal. For the purposes&#xD;
             of this study, post menopausal is defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1&#xD;
             year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor&#xD;
             symptoms. Postmenopausal status may be confirmed by serum FSH and oestradiol&#xD;
             concentrations at screening if deemed necessary by the PI. Surgical sterility will be&#xD;
             defined as females who have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal&#xD;
             ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis: an established clinical history of&#xD;

             Society/European Respiratory Society [American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory&#xD;
             Society, 2004] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a preventable and treatable&#xD;
             disease characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow&#xD;
             limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory&#xD;
             response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette&#xD;
             smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic&#xD;
             consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a cigarette smoking history of ≥10 pack years (1 pack year = 20&#xD;
             cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year or the equivalent). Both current and former&#xD;
             smokers are eligible to be enrolled. A former smoker is defined as a subject who has&#xD;
             not smoked for ≥6 months at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 to FVC ratio (FEV1:FVC) &lt; 0.7 at Visit 1.&#xD;

             receiving salbutamol 400 μg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects capable of providing signed written informed consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a QTc &lt;450 msec on baseline ECG or triplicate ECG averaged over a&#xD;
             brief recording interval. For subjects with baseline bundle branch block the QTc will&#xD;
             be &lt;480msec on baseline ECG or triplicate ECG averaged over a brief recording&#xD;
             interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subject will be eligible for randomisation at the end of the run-in period only if&#xD;
             the following additional criterion applies: Subjects with no evidence of an ongoing&#xD;
             acute infection or sinus symptoms Specific information regarding warnings,&#xD;
             precautions, contraindications, AEs, and other pertinent information on the&#xD;
