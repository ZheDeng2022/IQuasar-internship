      Computerized continuous performance tests (CPT) considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis&#xD;
      of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of tests are based mainly on visual performance. The available tests suffer from&#xD;
      high false negative errors. This raises questions regarding their ability to correctly&#xD;
      diagnose ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the expanding knowledge regarding the neurobiological basis in ADHD we have learned that&#xD;
      attention is not a general property of the whole brain, but involves several coordinated&#xD;
      networks. This knowledge promoted us to the stage in which we can recognize different types&#xD;
      of attention domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our diagnosis test can separate between the different attention abilities and provide&#xD;
      specific diagnosis. Our program is individually fits for the specific child difficulties and&#xD;
      covers a wider range of needs. So, it can be helpful to a larger variety of children with&#xD;
      different needs.&#xD;

      Computerized continuous performance tests (CPT) considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis&#xD;
      of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of tests measures the number of correctly detected stimuli as well as response&#xD;
      time. The diagnosis in this tests based mainly on visual performance. The available tests in&#xD;
      the market suffer from high false negative errors. In some subgroups of children the error&#xD;
      can be false positive. All this raises questions regarding their ability to correctly&#xD;
      diagnose ADHD. There are also doubts regarding the validity of these tests. From the medical&#xD;
      literature and from our own experience it seems that with the current tests as much as third&#xD;
      of the children who fulfill DSM criteria for ADHD can escape detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the expanding knowledge regarding the neurobiological basis in ADHD we have learned that&#xD;
      attention is not a general property of the whole brain, but involves several coordinated&#xD;
      networks. These networks must be orchestrated in order to perform normally in three main&#xD;
      domains of attention = alertness, orientation and executive function. This raised the need&#xD;
      for a better, more accurate and valid computerized test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This knowledge promoted us to the stage in which we can recognize different types of&#xD;
      attention domains. We can separate between - visual attention, auditory attention, spatial&#xD;
      attention, integrated attention, sustained attention, covert and overt attention, working&#xD;
      memory, the ability to integrate and disintegrate attention, attention span, focusing,&#xD;
      impulsivity and response time. Different people have different &quot;subtypes&quot; of ADHD. The&#xD;
      individual separation and ability to focus on specific difficulties influence diagnosis&#xD;
      process and treatment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our diagnosis test can separate between the different attention abilities and provide the&#xD;
      parents with specific diagnosis of their child and in this way direct them to the appropriate&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, we expect its falls negative and positive errors to be&#xD;
      negligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next phase - involves training and exercise. It is proved that training can improve&#xD;
      attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have also developed a computerized training program for children. This program is based on&#xD;
      the same platform as the diagnosis test and can recommend on training in the individual&#xD;
      difficulties of the specific child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other programs are already distributed in the market for the same propose. The other programs&#xD;
      focus on improving a general specific skill and ignore (or can not focus) on the specific&#xD;
      need of the individual. They can try to improve working memory which is only one aspect in&#xD;
      attention domain. Or, based on improving visual-motor skill, which is a skill that can be&#xD;
      improved in regular computer games and again focus on a specific short range difficulty. In&#xD;
      many children ADHD symptoms and signs are due to other sources. For them improving working&#xD;
      memory or visual-motor skills will not change their every day performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our program is better since it is individually fits for the specific child difficulties and&#xD;
      covers a wider range of needs. So, it can be helpful to a larger variety of children with&#xD;
      different needs.&#xD;
