  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if limiting dietary methionine (MET), one of the 10&#xD;
      essential amino acids (which make up proteins), causes weight loss and/or improves glucose&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methionine deficient diets have been shown to increase metabolic rate, decrease weight and&#xD;
      extend lifespan in rodents. A methionine deficient diet has been tested for 17 weeks in&#xD;
      humans without adverse events and with an average weight loss of 8 kg. This study will test&#xD;
      the ability of a low methionine diet to cause weight loss and improve the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
      The metabolic syndrome is driven by insulin resistance which is associated with abdominal&#xD;
      fat, so this study hopes to reduce visceral fat, body weight and improve insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four healthy males or females 21 to 60 years of age, inclusive with a stable weight&#xD;
      and a waist circumference &gt;40&quot; in men and &gt;35&quot; in women will participate in this study.&#xD;
      Subjects will need at least two of the following: 1) HDL cholesterol &lt; 40 mg/dL in men or &lt;&#xD;
      50 mg/dl in women; 2) triglycerides &gt; 150 mg/dL, 3) blood pressure &gt;130/85 mmHg; 4) fasting&#xD;
      glucose 110-125 mg/dL. Subjects who have diabetes, a history of heart attack, stroke, have&#xD;
      had cancer in the last five years or take chronic medication for a significant illness will&#xD;
      be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a medical history, physical examination, chemistry panel, complete blood&#xD;
      count (CBC), electrocardiogram, DEXA, abdominal CT scan to quantitate visceral fat, and blood&#xD;
      will be sent to Orentreich for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, lipid profile with particle size,&#xD;
      free fatty acids, adiponectin, leptin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and insulin-like&#xD;
      growth factor-1. Subjects will also undergo a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp to&#xD;
      quantitate insulin resistance during an 18 hr inpatient stay, and will spend 24 hours in the&#xD;
      metabolic chamber to measure metabolic rate. Subjects will then be placed on a diet of&#xD;
      Hominex-2, a drink that will give them their protein in an amount based on their body weight,&#xD;
      and they will see a dietitian who will give them a list of food they can eat consisting&#xD;
      mainly of fruits, vegetables and a small amount of grains. Calories will not be restricted&#xD;
      and subjects will receive a choline supplement of 500 mg/d. Subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive capsules containing methionine or placebo based on their body weight. The two groups&#xD;
      will be on 2mg/kg/d or 23 mg/kg/d of methionine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to PBRC every 2 weeks throughout the 16-week diet period to meet&#xD;
      with the dietician, have weight and vital signs recorded, and have fasting blood drawn every&#xD;
      4 weeks to be sent to Orentreich for compliance measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical exam, multi-slice CT scan, DEXA, inpatient admission for euglycemic&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic clamp, metabolic chamber stay, and the blood testing obtained at screening&#xD;
      and baseline will be repeated at the completion of the 16 week diet period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known risks to the low methionine diet, but some people may have&#xD;
      gastrointestinal upsets when they change their diet. The risk of the CT scan is exposure to&#xD;
      x-radiation equivalent to a front and side view chest x-ray. The risk of the DEXA is the&#xD;
      exposure to x-irradiation equivalent to spending 12 hours in the sunshine. There are no risks&#xD;
      to staying in the metabolic chamber. The hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp could cause low&#xD;
      blood sugar. This will be avoided by frequent monitoring of blood sugar, and if the low blood&#xD;
      sugar were to occur, the test would be stopped and sugar given through the intravenous line.&#xD;
      The testing of blood involves the discomfort of a needle going into an arm vein, bruising and&#xD;
      rarely fainting or infection. These risks will be minimized by trained technicians using&#xD;
      sterile needles.&#xD;
