    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether addition of automated whole breast&#xD;
      ultrasound to the usual screening mammography in a population of asymptomatic women with&#xD;
      mammographically dense breasts will result in a significantly greater number of breast&#xD;
      cancers discovered than would be found by mammography alone.&#xD;

      1. Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A total of sixteen thousand women at 16 centers, will be evaluated with SonoCiné&#xD;
           automated bilateral whole breast sonography and screening mammography. In this study a&#xD;
           motor driven carrier will be used to have the transducer examine each breast completely&#xD;
           [Appendix A]. In this way the images can be gathered in a contiguous manner and&#xD;
           displayed in a ciné strip and as three-dimensional images of each scan row.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These sonograms will be read by one of two designated investigator/radiologists at each&#xD;
           site. The mammograms will be not read until after the sonogram is performed and read,&#xD;
           and then will be read in the usual manner for that department without knowledge of the&#xD;
           automated breast ultrasound. The mammograms will not necessarily be read by one of the&#xD;
           investigators. The sonograms will initially be read and scored by one of the&#xD;
           investigators at each site. These sonograms will be reviewed as ciné loops and as&#xD;
           three-dimensional reconstructions of each scan row. The investigator will have no prior&#xD;
           knowledge of the patient's mammogram or the reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data will be entered from each site into a central computer via internet. This&#xD;
           computer will have no personal information about any subject other than her institution&#xD;
           ID number and her birth date. Following entry of data from the separate readings of the&#xD;
           mammogram and sonogram, one investigator will assess any abnormal mammogram or sonogram&#xD;
           in light of the other imaging study for that patient to evaluate whether combined&#xD;
           readings of both studies would have effected patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators' call back, short-term follow-up and biopsy recommendation rates for&#xD;
           the mammography, the sonography and the combined reading will be recorded. As with other&#xD;
           breast imaging studies needle or open biopsies will be recommended for the mammograms&#xD;
           and/or sonograms that are read as suspicious for carcinoma. Further diagnostic imaging&#xD;
           studies will be ordered for any indeterminate finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedures for Patient Entry on Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each patient is requested to obtain at her expense a screening mammogram on entry into&#xD;
           the study. She must also agree to have a screening mammogram one year later. The patient&#xD;
           must also give up the rights to the original films of the mammogram although copies will&#xD;
           be made for the patient without charge if needed. No other studies are required. However&#xD;
           the patient will also be required to fill out a demographic form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Criteria for Response Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each screening mammogram will be reviewed in the usual manner for that institution, not&#xD;
           necessarily by one of the investigators. Each screening ultrasound will be reviewed in a&#xD;
           timely manner by an investigator radiologist, and the patient will be informed of the&#xD;
           results either directly or through her physician. If any study is considered abnormal&#xD;
           the patient will be informed and called back for additional studies or other appropriate&#xD;
           action.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Definitions of Classification:&#xD;
&#xD;
           True and false positive and negative rates will be calculated based on the results of&#xD;
           the three initial imaging examinations, screening mammography (SM), screening automated&#xD;
           ultrasound (SU) and both screening studies combined (SC)), performed on each subject in&#xD;
           the PMA study. The above rates are calculated for each of the three initial imaging&#xD;
           examinations independent of the results of the other initial imaging examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           True Positive - A subject is TP for any of the three types of initial imaging&#xD;
           examinations (SM, SU, or SC) that leads to a biopsy proven cancer (invasive or in situ&#xD;
           breast cancer, or other intramammary malignancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
           True Negative - A subject is TN for each initial imaging examination whose initial&#xD;
           imaging examination is read as negative and who has a normal screening mammogram (or an&#xD;
           indeterminate mammogram subsequently shown not to be cancer) one year later, and has not&#xD;
           undergone a breast biopsy positive for cancer based on physical findings during the&#xD;
           interim.&#xD;
&#xD;
           False Positive - A subject is FP for a particular type of study, who has a benign breast&#xD;
           biopsy based on that study, and who does not have a breast cancer elsewhere discovered&#xD;
           by that study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           False Negative - A subject is FN for a particular type of initial imaging examination,&#xD;
           when the initial imaging examination is normal or benign, and a cancer is discovered on&#xD;
           one of the other types of initial imaging examinations, or is discovered on the one-year&#xD;
           mammogram, or is discovered by physical findings during the interim.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Callback - A callback (CB) occurs when a subject is recalled for further evaluation&#xD;
           because one of the initial imaging examinations is read as positive or indeterminate. A&#xD;
           SU callback is the sonographic equivalent of a diagnostic evaluation ordered from a SM&#xD;
           because of positive or indeterminate findings. Similarly, a SC callback occurs when&#xD;
           evaluation of both the SM and the SU together are indeterminate or positive and requires&#xD;
           further evaluation. CB rates will be calculated for each of the three initial imaging&#xD;
           examinations by comparing the number of CB's with the total number subjects. % CB rate =&#xD;
           Number of CB's / number of Study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Callbacks can have three different outcomes: resolution, by showing the initial imaging&#xD;
           examination was normal with further evaluation, short-term follow-up examination(s) at a&#xD;
           later date to evaluate the findings of the initial imaging examination and the CB&#xD;
           examination(s) further, or a biopsy because the initial imaging examination and/or the&#xD;
           call back examination were sufficiently suspicious to warrant tissue evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-Up - Follow-up (FU) rates will be calculated for each of the three initial&#xD;
           imaging examinations by comparing the number of short-term follow-up's with the total&#xD;
           number of subjects. % FU rate = Number of FU's / number of Study subjects. The rate of&#xD;
           positive follow-ups will be calculated. % +FU = Number of +FU's / Total number of&#xD;
           follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biopsy - Biopsy rates will be calculated for each of the three initial imaging&#xD;
           examinations by comparing the number of biopsies with the total number of subjects. %&#xD;
           Biopsy rate = Number of Biopsies / number of Study subjects. The rate of positive&#xD;
           biopsies will be calculated. % + Biopsies = Number of + Biopsies / Total number of&#xD;
           Biopsies. A subject may have more than one biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. &quot;Off Study&quot; Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study requires the performance of an initial mammogram, an initial automated&#xD;
           screening ultrasound, and a final mammogram at one year. The patient also agrees to&#xD;
           allow access to the results of any further diagnostic tests that occur because of&#xD;
           positive findings in the original screening mammogram or ultrasound. The subject may&#xD;
           withdraw at any time, in which case her data will not be utilized in the analysis. Any&#xD;
           patient not completing the above tests will also be excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 16,000 patients mostly will be covering the costs of their own tests, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that they will be coming from a well-screened population. Such a population over&#xD;
      the age of 40 years would be expected to generate interval cancers at a rate of about 0.25%&#xD;
      annually. Consequently, about 40 carcinomas would present themselves for discovery during the&#xD;
      study. Given the 20 to 25% expected false negative rate from screening mammography 8 to 10&#xD;
      cancers will be available for discovery only by SonoCiné. If SonoCiné were to have an&#xD;
      independent 20 to 25% false negative rate it would be expected to find 6 to 8 of the&#xD;
      remaining cancers. If mammography is utilized alone with an estimated 75% accuracy, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that 30 cancers would be identified based on mammography screening with a failure&#xD;
      of 10 cancers not found. With the addition of Sonociné screening, it is predicted that&#xD;
      additional 8 cancers would be found and the total failure rate (false negative findings)&#xD;
      would be 2 cancers. This would increase the accuracy to 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If SonoCiné generally finds cancers at a smaller size than screening mammography, the actual&#xD;
      number of cancers discovered by SonoCiné may be higher, since it will find some of the&#xD;
      cancers that would be discovered by screening mammography the following year before they&#xD;
      presented clinically. Also women with a known higher risk of breast cancer may&#xD;
      disproportionately volunteer for this study and more cancers may be found both by mammography&#xD;
      and automated whole breast ultrasound than expected. Since women are aware that&#xD;
      mammographically dense breasts are more prone to be falsely negative by mammography, more&#xD;
      women with this condition may join the study than expected. This may produce more&#xD;
      mammographically occult cancers than expected. Breast density is one of the variables&#xD;
      recorded in all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discriminant Function analysis will be the analysis of choice based on the fact that we wish&#xD;
      to distinguish among several mutually exclusive groups, the best predictor that are important&#xD;
      for distinguishing among the groups, and to develop a procedure for predicting group&#xD;
      membership for new cases. The concept underlying discriminant analysis is that that linear&#xD;
      combinations of independent variables are formed and serve as a basis for classifying cases&#xD;
      into one of the groups. Assumptions include that each group must be a sample from a&#xD;
      multivariate normal population and the population covariance matrices must be equal, although&#xD;
      discriminant function analysis works fairly well in cases were there are exceptions.&#xD;
      Dichotomous variables can also be included as predictor variables. Emphasis is on analyzing&#xD;
      all the variables at one time and considering them together. By considering them&#xD;
      simultaneously we are able to incorporate important information about their relationships&#xD;
      with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the variables are interrelated, we will need to employ statistical techniques that&#xD;
      incorporate these dependencies by analyzing the differences between groups by significance&#xD;
      tests for the equality of group means for each variable utilizing F values, and their&#xD;
      significance, and Wilks' Lambda to compare within group variability with total variability.&#xD;
      Small values of lambda indicate that means associated with variables predicting group&#xD;
      membership are different and may lead to model development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since interdependencies among the variables affect most multivariate analyses, it is&#xD;
      important to look at the correlation matrix of the predictor variables. Prior probability is&#xD;
      an estimate of the likelihood that a case belongs to a particular group. Knowledge of prior&#xD;
      probabilities can be calculated based on published statistics and is estimated to be .25% for&#xD;
      cancer in the screening population. To take advantage of additional information available for&#xD;
      developing a classification scheme for probability of group membership, classification of&#xD;
      actual group membership can be compared with predicted group membership as well using&#xD;
      discriminant function. Variables used to predict group memberships will be drawn from the&#xD;
      Patient Form, the Imaging Form and the Biopsy Form. Variables will include initial risk&#xD;
      factors, results of mammography findings, SonoCiné findings and the results of the biopsy.&#xD;
      Although some variables are coded as categorical, most are ordinal and as interval and are&#xD;
      appropriate for Discriminant Function analysis or the use of General Linear Model Procedure&#xD;
      (GLM).Additional analysis looking at the distribution of time between events utilizing Life&#xD;
      Tables and an extended Cox Regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficiency is defined as the use of resources that will produce the maximum benefit.&#xD;
      Cost-benefit analysis can be performed at the end of the study by expressing both the&#xD;
      benefits and costs of a program, not only in dollars but in quality of life and reduction of&#xD;
      suffering. Benefits of the study, in addition to increased detection rate, may include over&#xD;
      time an earlier detection of smaller cancers and an actual reduction in the need for biopsy.&#xD;
      This will impact treatment and resource utilization also.&#xD;

    <description>AWBU is a computer-based system for performing and recording ultrasound scans of the whole breast. The transducer of any suitable high-resolution compound ultrasound equipment is attached to a mechanical arm guided by computer, and images are acquired in longitudinal rows, overlapping to assure complete coverage. The mechanical arm controls transducer speed and position, with a technician maintaining appropriate contact pressure and orientation vertical to the skin. Approximately 150-300 images per row are immediately displayed on the AWBU monitor, then permanently stored.&#xD;
The AWBU software creates a continuous ciné loop of the images, creating the appearance of real-time scanning. With spatial registration, any point on an image can be identified as a distance from the nipple in a specific radius. Image review is optimized by playback on a high-resolution monitor to allow compressed image size, 3-D reconstruction, and adjustment of contrast, brightness and review speed.</description>
