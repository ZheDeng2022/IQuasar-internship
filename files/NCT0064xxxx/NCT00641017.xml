  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human Parainfluenza Virus Type 1 (HPIV1) is a leading cause of viral respiratory infections&#xD;
      in children, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems. HPIV1 is also the&#xD;
      leading cause of viral croup in children under 6 years old. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety of and immune response to a HPIV1 vaccine, rHPIVI1 84/del170/942A, in 2&#xD;
      groups of adults and then in children who have been previously exposed to HPIV1. Once the&#xD;
      safety of this vaccine has been established in these groups, an additional 2 groups of&#xD;
      infants and children who have not been previously exposed to HPIV1 will be vaccinated. Naïve&#xD;
      infants and children are the most vulnerable to naturally circulating HPIV1 and are the&#xD;
      target population of this vaccine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HPIV1 infection can result in severe respiratory illness that often leads to the&#xD;
      hospitalization of infants and young children. HPIV1 is responsible for approximately 6% of&#xD;
      all pediatric hospitalizations for respiratory tract diseases and is a main cause of severe&#xD;
      lower respiratory tract diseases, including pneumonia and bronchiolitis in children less than&#xD;
      6 years old. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of and immune response to a&#xD;
      HPIV1 vaccine, rHPIVI1 84/del170/942A, in 5 main volunteer group: first in adults (group 1&#xD;
      and 2), and then in seropositive children (group 3). The last 2 groups will be seronegative&#xD;
      infants and children that are split into 2 dosing groups; one group of seronegative infants&#xD;
      and children will receive a lower dose of vaccine (group 4) and a second group of&#xD;
      seronegative infants and children (group 5) will receive a higher dose of vaccine. This study&#xD;
      will last approximately 8 weeks per group. Additional information about each of the groups is&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 1 and 2 will consist of 35 adults total, 18 to 49 years of age. These groups will&#xD;
      receive one immunization with rHPIV1 84/del170/942A at study entry. Immunization will be&#xD;
      given as nose drops. Study visits will occur on Days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 28. Medical&#xD;
      history, vital signs, clinical assessment, and nasal wash will occur at most visits. Blood&#xD;
      and urine tests will occur at selected visits. A urine pregnancy test will occur for females&#xD;
      at study entry. Follow-up phone reports will also be required on Day 56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment into Group 3 will begin only after safety data from Groups 1 and 2 are evaluated.&#xD;
      Group 3 will consist of 15 seropositive children, 15 to 59 months of age. This group will&#xD;
      receive either one immunization of rHPIV1 84/del170/942A or placebo at study entry.&#xD;
      Immunization will be given as nose drops. Study visits will occur on Days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10,&#xD;
      and 28. Medical history, vital signs, clinical assessment, and nasal wash will occur at most&#xD;
      visits. Blood and urine tests will occur at selected visits. Parents will be required to&#xD;
      submit reports over the phone throughout the study. These reports will include the temporal&#xD;
      temperature from the previous day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment into Group 4 will begin only after safety data from Group 3 are evaluated. Group 4&#xD;
      will consist of 21-30 seronegative infants and children, 6 to 59 months of age. This group&#xD;
      will receive either one immunization of rHPIV1 84/del170/942A or placebo at study entry.&#xD;
      Immunization will be given as nose drops. Study visits will occur on Days 3, 5, 7, 10, 12,&#xD;
      14, 17, 19, 21, 28, and 56. Medical history, vital signs, clinical assessment, and nasal wash&#xD;
      will occur at most visits. Blood tests will occur at selected visits. Parents will be&#xD;
      required to submit reports over the phone throughout the study. These reports will include&#xD;
      the temporal temperature from the previous day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment into Group 5 will begin only after safety data from Group 4 are evaluated. Group 5&#xD;
      will consist of 21-30 seronegative infants and children 6 to 59 months of age. This group&#xD;
      will receive either one immunization of rHPIV1 84/del170/942A or placebo at study entry. The&#xD;
      immunization will be given as nose drops. The vaccine dosage that participants receive in&#xD;
      Group 5 will be greater than the dose in Group 4. Study visits will occur on Days 3, 5, 7,&#xD;
      10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, 28, and 56. Medical history, vital signs, clinical assessment, and&#xD;
      nasal wash will occur at most visits. Blood tests will occur at selected visits. Parents will&#xD;
      be required to submit reports over the phone throughout the study. These reports will include&#xD;
      the temporal temperature from the previous day.&#xD;
