  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans returning from combat deployments face the interrelated challenges of processing&#xD;
      their combat experiences and transitioning back to civilian life. Unfortunately, many&#xD;
      veterans wait years or decades before seeking help for post-deployment problems, if they seek&#xD;
      it at all. This study seeks to determine whether Internet-Based Expressive Writing (IB-EW), a&#xD;
      brief, low-cost, easily disseminated, and resource-efficient intervention, can reduce&#xD;
      psychological symptoms and improve functioning among Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and&#xD;
      Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) veterans as they navigate this transition, while also&#xD;
      attempting to reduce barriers to help-seeking. Expressive Writing, a highly private, readily&#xD;
      accessible, and non-stigmatizing intervention, has a strong evidence-base in civilian&#xD;
      populations, but its efficacy in combat veterans has not been tested. This study therefore&#xD;
      seeks to test the efficacy of Expressive Writing in a veteran population while further&#xD;
      enhancing its accessibility by delivering it over the internet (Internet-Based Expressive&#xD;
      Writing; IB-EW). This study will comprise a randomized controlled trial with three&#xD;
      conditions: (a) Internet-Based Expressive Writing, (b) Internet-Based Control Writing, and&#xD;
      (c) No Writing/Treatment As Usual, with a total of 1152 OIF/OEF veterans randomized across&#xD;
      these groups. Expressive Writing participants will write with feeling about their transition&#xD;
      from being a soldier to being a civilian; Control Writing participants will write factually&#xD;
      about the information needs of new veterans; and Treatment as Usual participants will&#xD;
      complete the assessments but not engage in any writing assignments. Participants will&#xD;
      complete standardized self-report measures of psychological symptoms, psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning, and life satisfaction at baseline (Session 1) and at three months (Session 6)&#xD;
      and six months (Session 7) post-intervention. Participants in writing conditions will write&#xD;
      for 20 minutes on four consecutive days (Sessions 2-5) following completion of baseline&#xD;
      measures (participants in the TAU condition will not complete Sessions 2-5). The study will&#xD;
      also attempt to identify individual difference characteristics related to the efficacy of the&#xD;
      treatment, to see who may be most likely to benefit from the treatment. Analyses will&#xD;
      primarily entail multivariate analyses of variance. Power is adequate to detect even a small&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
