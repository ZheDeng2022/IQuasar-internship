  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study of the complex genetics of brain development will be undertaken with an emphasis on&#xD;
      those genes that cause the most common structural brain anomaly in humans called&#xD;
      holoprosencephaly (HPE). This malformation of the brain can result from either environmental&#xD;
      or genetic causes, and it is the aim of these investigations to determine the genes&#xD;
      responsible for both normal and abnormal brain development through the study of patients with&#xD;
      this disorder. Mutations in one such gene, Sonic Hedgehog, have been shown by us to be&#xD;
      responsible for approximately one quarter of familial cases of HPE. Other genes either&#xD;
      related to the hedgehog pathway or located at unrelated defined genetic loci may also&#xD;
      contribute to HPE and are the subject of active investigation. We anticipate that many genes&#xD;
      important for normal brain development will be identified in the search for genetic causes of&#xD;
      HPE.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Holoprosencephaly (HPE) covers a nearly continuous spectrum of midline abnormalities ranging&#xD;
      from unmistakable cyclopia with absence of forebrain separation to mild microforms, such a&#xD;
      single central incisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of these studies is to identify genetic factors (coding and non-coding) that&#xD;
      contribute to the pathogenesis of holoprosencephaly (HPE) or related brain malformations. Our&#xD;
      approach involves common genetic strategies including mutational analysis of candidate genes.&#xD;
      All individuals with overt or subtle clinical findings consistent with the HPE spectrum are&#xD;
      eligible to participate. Mutational analysis of our entire coded collection of HPE probands&#xD;
      (approximately 600 cases) in selected genes is the principal research method used to&#xD;
      determine that a given candidate gene is commonly mutated in HPE. This approach pertains to&#xD;
      an individual gene(s) or genetic element(s) as well as to targeted capture panels that study&#xD;
      gene sets of hundreds of developmental genes whose involvement in brain development is&#xD;
      supported by the basic research literature. We are also asking to include the option of&#xD;
      investigating the entire set of genetic factors present in the DNA or RNA of patients who&#xD;
      have HPE through a proposed change in the consent documents. Whenever a sequence variant is&#xD;
      identified, that is not present in a commercially available control set of samples, attempts&#xD;
      are made to test the functional significance of this change on the protein itself, or its&#xD;
      expression. Sequence changes with a strong probability of being medically significant will be&#xD;
      verified in a CLIA-approved lab (e.g. Muneke lab, for selected genes, or commercial lab) at&#xD;
      our expense, before any results are given to the family through genetic counseling. Parental&#xD;
      DNA (and rarely that of siblings) is usually obtained at the same time that a proband is&#xD;
      enrolled. Typically, these samples are studied only to perform limited family studies once a&#xD;
      sequence variant of potential medical significance has already been determined. Participation&#xD;
      by direct blood relatives is encouraged since virtually all bone fide mutations are either&#xD;
      family-specific or de novo. Such family information is critical for the research&#xD;
      determination of genetic risk factors and accurate genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of subjects enrolled in this study will continue under the care of their local&#xD;
      physician or genetic counselor with limited contact with the NIH investigators. Only rarely&#xD;
      will families be seen at the NIH CC. These visits will involve face-to-face genetic&#xD;
      counseling of medically significant results, following verification in a CLIA approved lab.&#xD;
      This is not a treatment protocol. Our empiric ability to generate medically significant&#xD;
      research results is limited by the extensive genetic and other etiologic heterogeneity.&#xD;
      Therefore, for most participants this research is not a diagnostic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have modified our procedures to test all new probands for mutations in the four HPE genes&#xD;
      (SHH, ZIC2, SIX3 and TGIF). As new genetic elements that confer a risk for HPE are&#xD;
      identified, we intend to add additional tests to this panel. Our lab is now certified to&#xD;
      receive and test new samples according to CLIA guidelines. However, all previously collected&#xD;
      samples will not be considered suitable for diagnostic purposes; hence, a second sample will&#xD;
      need to be requested in these cases for CLIA confirmation.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. This research is open to all participants with a known or suspected diagnosis of&#xD;
                  HPE or related brain malformations. Since the range of severity of HPE is&#xD;
                  extensive, we accept cases compatible with a wide HPE spectrum of findings. All&#xD;
                  races and genders are known to be at risk for HPE, anywhere in the world.&#xD;
                  Nationality or place of origin are not specific barriers to participation,&#xD;
                  provided that a blood tissue sample can be safely sent by international FedEx (to&#xD;
                  be billed to our account).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Direct blood relatives (typically parents, and occasionally siblings of affected&#xD;
                  individuals) of patients with HPE are also eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Pregnant women with a fetus with imaging evidence of holoprosencephaly. Most&#xD;
                  pregnancies affected by holoprosencephaly do not survive to term; therefore,&#xD;
                  pregnant women will be included in the study. DNA obtained from pregnant women&#xD;
                  (amniocytes and blood) will be analyzed for genetic etiologies. This will allow&#xD;
                  for recurrence risk assessment and genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent (for themselves as adults, or on behalf&#xD;
             of their children as minors) or assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Medical condition(s) or cognitive impairment are not in themselves reason for&#xD;
             exclusion if in the judgement of the referring physician this would involve no more&#xD;
             than minimal risk. We anticipate that children with mental handicaps would be included&#xD;
             in the research population. We will make every effort to explain the study for the&#xD;
             purpose of assent in a matter that the family feels is both age and developmentally&#xD;
             appropriate for that child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. We generally review a brief clinical description from the referring physician about a&#xD;
             potential research subject to determine that the subject is appropriate to enter into&#xD;
             the study. We reserve the right to exclude cases that are clearly not HPE or related&#xD;
             to our direct research interests (e.g. HPE cases due to Trisomy 13 or 18 might not be&#xD;
             considered directly related to current research). This almost never happens, and we&#xD;
             would attempt to make referrals to a more appropriate investigator before a sample is&#xD;
             sent to the NIH. Although not desirable, we will accept samples with a suspected&#xD;
             diagnosis of HPE where this determination was made by the referring physician&#xD;
             independent of any input from our HPE team. In such circumstances, we would likely&#xD;
             verify by correspondence that a sample had been received and request further&#xD;
             information.&#xD;
