      Rates of suicide among young Alaska Native males are over ten-fold higher than among a&#xD;
      similar age cohort in the rest of the United States. A high proportion of these deaths are&#xD;
      associated with firearms. Firearms are an important part of the subsistence lifestyle of this&#xD;
      population, however restriction of access to guns by youth may be a promising strategy to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of suicides in this population. Previous research conducted in the first&#xD;
      phase of this project has demonstrated that about 75% of homes in rural southwest Alaskan&#xD;
      villages have guns, and only about 15% of these guns are locked; 6% are loaded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this specific phase of the study to execute a randomized trial of an intervention&#xD;
      to improve firearm storage practices among residents of selected villages. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that households receiving training and equipment to store firearms in gun lockers will be&#xD;
      more likely to store their guns locked at 12 months, compared to households not receiving the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      Rates of suicide among young Alaska Native males are over ten-fold higher than among a&#xD;
      similar age cohort in the rest of the United States. A high proportion of these deaths are&#xD;
      associated with firearms. Firearms are an important part of the subsistence lifestyle of this&#xD;
      population, however restriction of access to guns by youth may be a promising strategy to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of suicides in this population. Recent work by the HIPRC has shown that&#xD;
      locked guns are associated with a 73% reduced risk of suicide, compared to unlocked guns.&#xD;
      Similar protective associations were found for unloaded guns. A recent pilot project to&#xD;
      improve the storage of guns conducted in southwest Alaska increased the proportion of&#xD;
      households having all guns locked from 15% to 85%. The aims of this proposed study are to&#xD;
      estimate the prevalence of firearm ownership and of specific firearm storage practices among&#xD;
      residents living in the Bristol Bay and Yukon-Kuskokwim regions of southwest Alaska and to&#xD;
      work with the Alaska Native health corporations to plan and execute a randomized trial of an&#xD;
      intervention to improve firearm storage practices among residents of selected villages. This&#xD;
      3-year study consists of two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase is a regional survey of households within 20 randomly selected villages in&#xD;
      southwest Alaska to estimate the extent of firearm ownership and existing storage practices&#xD;
      in these communities. This weighted sample would be extrapolated to an overall estimate of&#xD;
      these variables for each of the two Native corporations in the region. The second phase of&#xD;
      the study will be a two-arm randomized controlled trial of an intervention to increase the&#xD;
      proportion of households that store all of their firearms in a locked safe. A secondary&#xD;
      outcome will be to reduce the proportion of home reporting the presence of a loaded gun.&#xD;
      Households will be randomly assigned to either an early or late intervention group. The&#xD;
      'early' intervention group will receive the intervention at baseline. The 'late' intervention&#xD;
      group will receive the intervention 12 months after baseline. All eligible households within&#xD;
      participating villages will be educated about the potential protective value of safe firearm&#xD;
      storage practices, and then be offered a gun safe to store all of their firearms. Household&#xD;
      adults will be trained to use the safe and to carefully restrict access to the guns by youth.&#xD;
      Each household will complete a questionnaire about storage practices and important&#xD;
      co-variates at baseline, 12 months, and 18 months. Data will be analyzed to detect&#xD;
      differences, between groups, in the proportion of homes with unlocked guns, and loaded guns,&#xD;
      at 12 and 18 months after baseline. We estimate that the enrollment of 350 homes at baseline&#xD;
      should provide 90% power to detect differences of about 16-20 absolute percentage point&#xD;
      difference between groups, depending on the baseline prevalence of these variables. This&#xD;
      study has the potential to have an important effect on firearm storage patterns in a&#xD;
      population at high risk for suicide. If proven successful, it could be disseminated&#xD;
      throughout Alaska and other high risk communities.&#xD;
