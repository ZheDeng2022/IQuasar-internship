      Background. Clinical benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) have been clearly&#xD;
      demonstrated in heart failure (HF) patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and&#xD;
      wide QRS at surface electrocardiogram. However, there is a growing evidence that QRS duration&#xD;
      poorly predicts responses to CRT, and that ~30% of patients do not experience any benefit&#xD;
      from CRT when pre-implant dyssynchrony is defined according to electrocardiographic criteria.&#xD;
      A number of echocardiographic criteria have been proposed to assess mechanical LV&#xD;
      dyssynchrony, but at present there is no consensus on their use to predict response to CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design. The Italian Multicenter PROject on echo assessment of left VEntricular&#xD;
      (IMPROVE) dyssynchrony study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study aimed to&#xD;
      assess feasibility and predictive power of mechanical dyssynchrony assessed by&#xD;
      echocardiography in consecutive consenting patients candidate to CRT by clinical and&#xD;
      electrocardiographic criteria. IMPROVE will enroll 120 healthy subjects and 216 HF patients&#xD;
      in 6 sites in Italy. CRT response criteria will be based on improvement in NYHA class and LV&#xD;
      reverse remodeling evaluated by 3D-echocardiography. Enrollment is expected to conclude early&#xD;
      2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications. CRT is today part of the therapeutic armamentarium for symptomatic HF patients&#xD;
      refractory to medical therapy, with wide QRS complex and severe LV systolic dysfunction. The&#xD;
      IMPROVE study has been designed to evaluate reference values of indexes of ultrasound&#xD;
      mechanical dyssynchrony that have been proposed in the literature and compare their ability&#xD;
      to predict response to CRT in HF patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IMPROVE study has 3 main purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. definition of reference values of echocardiographic mechanical dyssynchrony (DYS)&#xD;
           indexes in a population of healthy subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. definition of the feasibility and reproducibility of such indexes in healthy subjects&#xD;
           and in HF patients undergoing implantation of a biventricular pacemaker;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. definition of the accuracy of such indexes for predicting response to CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY DESIGN. Multicenter, prospective, observational study that will be carried out in&#xD;
           6 Italian sites of acknowledged expertise in LV DYS evaluation and biventricular&#xD;
           pacemaker implantation. At least 120 healthy subjects (about 20 per site) and 216 HF&#xD;
           patients candidates to CRT (about 36 per site) will be enrolled. With this sample volume&#xD;
           it is possible to test statistically significative differences of about 7%, with an&#xD;
           alfa=0.05 and beta=0.50. Definition of healthy subject includes absence of history and&#xD;
           symptoms of any cardiovascular disease, normal physical examination and ECG. The same&#xD;
           commercial ultrasound equipment will be used for image acquisition in each investigating&#xD;
           center and echo studies will be sent to a core-lab for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both ischemic and non ischemic etiology of HF will be considered. Patients with&#xD;
           permanent or persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter will be excluded, as these&#xD;
           patients cannot benefit from the atrial-ventricular component of resynchronization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - clinical examination, including NYHA class estimate;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  12-lead standard ECG;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  echocardiographic examination. will be performed within 7 days before CRT and&#xD;
                repeated after 3 months of CRT. Patients will receive all appropriate treatments&#xD;
                for HF, which include a diuretic, an ACE- inhibitor, or an angiotensin receptor&#xD;
                blocker and usually digitalis and a beta-blocker. Doses of these background&#xD;
                medications will be kept maximized during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Response to CRT will be assessed after 3 months of CRT as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CRT response: combined end-point defined as NYHA class improvement by at least one&#xD;
                grade and echocardiographic LV end-systolic volume decrease by at least 10% with&#xD;
                respect to baseline (variations are considered as relative values);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CRT non-response: death for cardiac causes or failure to reach the above&#xD;
                pre-specified NYHA class and echocardiographic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who will die for non-cardiac causes will not be considered as non-responders&#xD;
           but will exit the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Image acquisition. Conventional M-mode and B-mode two-dimensional (2D)&#xD;
           echocardiography, conventional pulsed (PW), continuous (CW) wave and color Doppler,&#xD;
           tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), triplane tissue synchronization imaging (TSI) and RT3DE&#xD;
           techniques will be used for data acquisition in each site using a GE-Vingmed Vivid 7&#xD;
           Dimension echo scanner (GE Healthcare, Horten, Norway), equipped with a broad-band M3s&#xD;
           probe (2.5 MHz) and a matrix-array 3V probe (2.5 MHz), and the EchoPAC software v. BT05&#xD;
           or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ultrasound scanning will be performed after 10 min rest with the patient in left lateral&#xD;
           decubitus position (unless differently specified). Standard parasternal, apical and&#xD;
           subcostal views will be acquired in conventional 2D modality. From the parasternal&#xD;
           approach the 3 standard short-axis views (basal, mid-ventricle and apical) will be&#xD;
           collected. The mid-LV short-axis view will be selected with the papillary muscle as a&#xD;
           consistent internal anatomic landmark, and great care will be taken to orient the image&#xD;
           to the most circular geometry possible. Oblique views with elliptical geometry will not&#xD;
           be recorded. From the apical approach, the 3 standard apical views (4-chamber,&#xD;
           2-chamber, long-axis) will be acquired also in triplane mode. Using this technique, once&#xD;
           the apical 4-chamber view is optimized similar to the one obtained with the traditional&#xD;
           2D transducer, secondary image planes (i.e., apical 2-chamber and long-axis views) are&#xD;
           automatically displayed in a quad screen view. The relative angles between the 3 image&#xD;
           planes will be adjusted to acquire the 3 standard apical views according to anatomical&#xD;
           landmarks. All apical images (2D and triplane) will be collected in gray-scale, color&#xD;
           TDI and TSI modality. Gain settings will be adjusted for routine clinical gray-scale 2D&#xD;
           imaging to optimize endocardial definition; frame rates will be kept between 55 and 70&#xD;
           fps to allow subsequent speckle tracking analysis (see below). Sector angle, depth, and&#xD;
           Doppler pulse repetition frequency will be optimized to obtain the highest possible&#xD;
           frame rate (&gt;100 fps) avoiding loss of spatial data and aliasing in the TDI modality.&#xD;
           RT3DE datasets will be obtained from the apical approach immediately after acquisition&#xD;
           of 2D apical views, with the patient in the same position. In order to include the&#xD;
           entire LV into the 3D dataset, a full-volume acquisition mode will be used. Using this&#xD;
           approach it is possible to &quot;stitch&quot; together 4 sub-volumes obtained in real-time over&#xD;
           consecutive cardiac cycles according to a previously described technique and protocol.&#xD;
           This will create an on-line rendered image of the scanning sector with a time resolution&#xD;
           of around 40-50 ms equivalent to a volume rate of 20-25 volumes per second. Measurements&#xD;
           of RT3DE volumes will be performed off-line (4D analysis, TomTec Gmbh, Ubterschlessheim,&#xD;
           Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the study of MR, the standard color Doppler examination will be performed in the&#xD;
           apical 4- and 2-chamber views to visualize the regurgitant jet; the flow convergence&#xD;
           area will be recorded in the apical 4-chamber view in zoom mode, with color bar baseline&#xD;
           set between 30 and 40 cm/s; finally, the CW Doppler tracing of the regurgitant jet will&#xD;
           be acquired in the 4-chamber view.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The PW Doppler examination will be performed positioning the sample volume at the level&#xD;
           of the valve tips in the apical 4-chamber view for assessment of mitral inflow and at&#xD;
           the level of the aortic anulus for assessment of aortic outflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All conventional and TDI images will be acquired in a cineloop format during hold&#xD;
           end-expiration (unless differently specified). Each cineloop and Doppler tracing will&#xD;
           contain 3 cardiac cycles. All images and tracings will be stored on a CD-ROM for&#xD;
           subsequent analysis. At the time of the echo examination blood pressure will be also&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Measurements. LV size will be evaluated measuring the end-diastolic and end-systolic&#xD;
           diameters (EDD, ESD, cm) on 2D parasternal short-axis view images and calculating the&#xD;
           end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV, ml) using RT3DE. The EDD and EDV will&#xD;
           be indexed for body surface area. LV systolic function will be evaluated using both the&#xD;
           ejection fraction (EF, %) calculated from volumes and the Doppler dP/dt (mmHg/ms)&#xD;
           calculated from the CW MR tracing, when available. MR severity will be evaluated by: (1)&#xD;
           the maximal regurgitant jet area visualized by color Doppler in the apical 4- and&#xD;
           2-chamber views (the average value of the two views will be calculated); (2) the PISA&#xD;
           method; (3) the duration of the CW Doppler tracing of the regurgitant flow. Systolic&#xD;
           pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) will be calculated from the CW tricuspid regurgitation&#xD;
           tracing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several indexes of LV DYS have been selected based on published validation studies in&#xD;
           which LV reverse remodeling has been considered as an end-point (single or combined) and&#xD;
           at least 3 months of follow-up after CRT have been used. Dyssynchrony indexes will be&#xD;
           calculated as previously reported in the literature (the respective cut-off value to&#xD;
           predict positive response to CRT is shown in parentheses).&#xD;
&#xD;
           M-mode indexes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Septal-to-posterior wall motion delay (cut-off value= 130 ms): measurement will be&#xD;
                obtained from the M-mode tracing of the LV as the time interval between the maximal&#xD;
                inward motion of the septum and the left posterior wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lateral wall postsystolic displacement: difference of intervals from QRS onset to&#xD;
                maximal systolic displacement of the basal LV lateral wall (assessed by M-mode in&#xD;
                apical 4-chamber view) and from QRS onset to the beginning of the E wave (assessed&#xD;
                by PW Doppler of mitral inflow); a positive value identifies a pathologic&#xD;
                post-systolic contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TDI time intervals and indexes&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Time to peak systolic velocity: the interval from onset of the QRS to the maximum&#xD;
           positive velocity during the ejection period. The velocities in the isovolumic&#xD;
           contraction and relaxation periods will not be used in this measurement. The region of&#xD;
           interest (ROI) (6 x 6-mm circular shape) will be positioned in the middle of each&#xD;
           segment. Time to peak velocity (Tv) will be measured on each curve from the beginning of&#xD;
           the Q (or R)-wave on the ECG to the peak positive systolic velocity during the ejection&#xD;
           phase, previously defined by the aortic valve opening and closure times. If a positive&#xD;
           velocity will not be observed, the segment will be excluded from the calculation. If&#xD;
           there will be multiple peaks in ejection period with the same velocity, the earliest&#xD;
           peak will be chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to peak velocity, including the postejection period: the interval from onset&#xD;
                of the QRS to the maximum positive velocity, including the period after aortic&#xD;
                valve closure. Everything else as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to peak strain: the interval from onset of the QRS to peak negative strain&#xD;
                throughout the cardiac cycle, including postsystolic shortening. The region of&#xD;
                interest (ROI) (6 x 12-mm oval shape) will be positioned in the middle of each&#xD;
                segment. If negative strain will not be identified, the segment will be excluded&#xD;
                from the calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to peak strain exceeding aortic valve closure (ExcT: exceeding time): the&#xD;
                interval between the marker of aortic closure and the nadir of the strain tracing.&#xD;
                ExcT will be considered 0 when the nadir of strain curve will not exceed aortic&#xD;
                valve closure. Everything else as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition to the time intervals described above, the triplane TSI display of LV&#xD;
           electro-mechanical delays will be evaluated visually (VT-TSI) during the systolic&#xD;
           ejection phase to identify a severe lateral wall delay, marked by the presence of red&#xD;
           color on the lateral wall (alone or in association with other severely delayed&#xD;
           segments).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using the above described time intervals, the following DY indexes reported in the&#xD;
           literature will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Septal-lateral delay (cut-off value= 65 ms): maximum time delay between peak&#xD;
                systolic velocities among four basal segments in 4 chamber and 2 chamber view.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anteroseptal-posterior delay (cut-off value= 65 ms): absolute time difference in&#xD;
                time to peak systolic velocity, including the postejection period, between the&#xD;
                basal inferolateral and basal anteroseptal segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Standard deviation in time to peak systolic velocity in the 12 basal and mid&#xD;
                segments using both the two-dimensional tissue Doppler (cut-off value= 33.6 ms) and&#xD;
                the novel triplane TSI modality (Tv-SD index).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Standard deviation in time to peak strain (cut-off value= 60 ms) among 12 basal and&#xD;
                mid segments as a strain-derived dyssynchrony index (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall time of strain exceeding aortic valve closure (cut-off value= 760 ms) as&#xD;
                the sum of 12 basal and mid segments ExcTs (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Also, the combined approach based on the Tv-SD index (cut-off value= 34.4 ms) and VT-TSI&#xD;
           severe lateral wall delay will be tested as described by Yu et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
           RT3DE For each of the 16 LV segment, the time taken to reach the minimum regional volume&#xD;
           will be measured and expressed as a percentage of the cardiac cycle. Then, the systolic&#xD;
           dyssynchrony index (cut-off value= 8.3%) will be calculated as the standard deviation in&#xD;
           time to minimum regional volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Speckle-tracking analysis For each of the 6 segments of the mid-ventricle short-axis&#xD;
           view, the time to peak radial strain will be measured. Then, the radial strain DYS&#xD;
           (cut-off value= 130 ms) index will be calculated as the difference between earliest and&#xD;
           latest time to peak strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Echo core and peripheral laboratory. All investigators must obtain the approval of the&#xD;
           core laboratory before participating in the study by sending a test CD-ROM of adequate&#xD;
           quality to the core laboratory. The core laboratory will be located in Udine (L.P.&#xD;
           Badano). A number of ultrasound images and tracings will be read in 2 peripheral&#xD;
           laboratories to test the interlaboratory reproducibility for evaluation of dyssynchrony&#xD;
           indexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Optimization of atrio-ventricular delay will be performed at pre-discharge using Doppler&#xD;
           echocardiography of transmitral flow to provide the maximum LV filling time without&#xD;
           compromising cardiac resynchronization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be described as mean and standard&#xD;
                deviation and categorical variables as counts and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Statistical analysis: generality. The analysis for the continuous variables will be&#xD;
                conducted by standard methods, unless there is evidence of important deviation from&#xD;
                assumptions of normality, in which case non-parametric &quot;bootstrap&quot; methods will be&#xD;
                used to generate confidence intervals. A two-sided p-value&lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
                statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
                1) Evaluation of feasibility and reproducibility of DYS indexes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Feasibility. Feasibility is defined for each DYS index by the number of patients in&#xD;
                whom the index was actually measured or calculated relative to the number of&#xD;
                patients in whom the measure or calculation was attempted. Feasibility will be&#xD;
                evaluated separately in normals and in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measurements of DYS indexes will be repeated in 15 baseline normal studies and 15&#xD;
                baseline patient studies by the same and a second observer at least one week after&#xD;
                the first assessment in the core laboratory to test intra and interobserver&#xD;
                variability. The same normal and patient studies will be read in two peripheral&#xD;
                laboratories to test the interlaboratory variability. All observers will be unaware&#xD;
                of the patients' characteristics, including ECG data. The Lin correlation&#xD;
                coefficient and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LOA) will be used to evaluate&#xD;
                intraobserver, interobserver and interlaboratory variabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the strength of the association between dyssynchrony indexes values at&#xD;
                baseline both in normals and in patients, the Pearson R and its 95% confidence&#xD;
                interval (95% C.I.) will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                2) Evaluation of the effects of CRT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variations over time. A paired Student t test or an exact symmetry homogeneity test&#xD;
                will be used to compare baseline and 3-month continuous and categorical values,&#xD;
                respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
                3) Evaluation of the predictive value of the dyssynchrony indexes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Association with CRT response and power analysis. The association between baseline&#xD;
                dyssynchrony indexes, considered as continuous variables, and CRT response after 3&#xD;
                months will be assessed by means of a logistic model. With the available sample&#xD;
                size and an alpha of 5%, the power for detecting the observed association of the&#xD;
                dyssynchrony indexes with CRT response is computed to 80% for each parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Association with CRT response based on DYS cut-off values. DYS parameters will also&#xD;
                be dichotomized according to the pre-specified cut-off values derived from previous&#xD;
                reports (see above). Model performances will be empirically compared through the c&#xD;
                statistics for the discriminating ability (corresponding to the model based area&#xD;
                under the ROC curve: the closer to 1, the better the model). Sensitivity and&#xD;
                specificity of the dichotomized dyssynchrony parameters with respect to response&#xD;
                will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Association with echocardiographic changes. The association of baseline&#xD;
                dyssynchrony indexes on a continuous scale with the relative changes in&#xD;
                echocardiographic EF and ESV after 3 months of CRT will be assessed by means of&#xD;
                Pearson R.&#xD;
