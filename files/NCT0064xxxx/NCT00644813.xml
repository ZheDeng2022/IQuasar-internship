  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant subset of patients with scapula fractures also involves the glenoid neck (bone&#xD;
      joining the shoulder joint the scapular body). There is little evidence pertaining to the&#xD;
      best treatment or precise definition of these lesions. This study will be designed as a&#xD;
      prospective, non-randomized cohort study that will collect outcome and radiological data on&#xD;
      patients who have sustained a fracture of the glenoid neck (bone joining the shoulder joint&#xD;
      the scapular body) for a period of 1 year. All patients who have sustained extraarticular&#xD;
      scapula fractures (any fracture not involving the glenoid surface) will be considered.&#xD;
      Information will be collected with respect to the radiographic characteristics of osseous&#xD;
      injuries as well as functional outcome over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extraarticular fractures (fracture not involving the glenoid articular surface) of the&#xD;
      scapula (shoulder blade) have been traditionally managed nonoperatively. The logic for this&#xD;
      course of treatment was based on the healing potential of the extensive muscular envelop of&#xD;
      the scapula, the inherent mobility of the shoulder joint, and the difficulty in objectively&#xD;
      assessing the degree of injury given its irregular osseous architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scapular fractures specifically involving the glenoid neck have the potential to&#xD;
      significantly change the geometry of glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) as well as affect&#xD;
      the actions of muscles and nerves that act across it. Although most reports indicate patients&#xD;
      sustaining glenoid neck fractures did well following nonoperative treatment, there was little&#xD;
      use of validated outcome measures. Additionally, the context of severe trauma may have lead&#xD;
      to an underestimation of functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in imaging technology combined with the evolution of internal fixation techniques&#xD;
      have resulted in sporadic attempts at fixation of glenoid neck fractures, usually when they&#xD;
      occurred in concert with bony injury to other members of the shoulder girdle, as in the&#xD;
      &quot;floating shoulder&quot;. However, in the absence of a universal canon of radiograph measurements,&#xD;
      there are no current recommendations for operative versus non-operative management based on&#xD;
      the characteristics of osseous injury as correlated with probable clinical outcome. Moreover,&#xD;
      the common assertion that nonoperative management of scapular fractures leads to adequate&#xD;
      functional outcome has not been rigorously examined in a prospective fashion, despite this&#xD;
      being the standard of care nationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence suggests that nonoperative treatment may lead to significant decreases in&#xD;
      strength and forelimb function despite the fact that the standard of care for the vast&#xD;
      majority of these injuries does not involve surgery or reduction. The same may be true of&#xD;
      glenoid neck fractures, as significant shortening or angulation of this metaphyseal isthmus&#xD;
      may have a detrimental effect on the functional geometry of the glenohumeral (shoulder)&#xD;
      joint. If so, surgical management may be indicated to restore a more physiologic geometry to&#xD;
      the joint, and thereby give the best chance of recovery to a pre-injury level of function. It&#xD;
      is our hope that these correlates of measurements and outcome will help codify an a priori&#xD;
      set of radiograph evaluation criteria to help guide decisions for surgical versus&#xD;
      non-operative management of glenoid neck fractures. The purpose of the study is to: 1) define&#xD;
      the degree of forelimb dysfunction brought about by this specific injury and 2) the magnitude&#xD;
      of osseous injury to the glenoid neck that can be tolerated before functional outcome is&#xD;
      unacceptably impeded.&#xD;
