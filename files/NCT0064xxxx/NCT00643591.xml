      The objectives of the trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the localisation within the primary tumor of the therapy resistant cells,&#xD;
           before and during radiotherapy to determine a possible accurate boost volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine changes during treatment intra- and extratumoral within the irradiated&#xD;
           area.(Intratumoral: change of up-take - decrease, increase, change of localization/&#xD;
           Extratumoral: effects of temporal changes in up-take - e.g. due to oedema).&#xD;

      Patients harboring a primary intracerebral high grade tumor (WHO III- IV) have a median&#xD;
      survival of six to 12 months. Combined chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide is now the&#xD;
      standard of care since results of the joint EORTC-NCIC phase III study randomizing between&#xD;
      radiotherapy alone and combined radiochemotherapy with temozolomide showed a significant&#xD;
      improvement in 2-years survival from 8% to 24% for the combined treatment arm (Stupp 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A differentiation between possible responders and non-responders before the start of&#xD;
      irradiation may eventual be possible by the use of 18F-FDG PET-CT. Preliminary own results&#xD;
      have shown that a higher metabolic activity in glioblastoma as measured on a simulation&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET-CT scan can be a prognosticator for shortened survival (Baumert, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary data show that a high uptake of 18F-FDG on a PET-CT scan before radiotherapy&#xD;
      in glioblastoma could be a marker for reduced survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Popperl et al showed that dual phase FDG PET imaging is superior in differentiating low-grade&#xD;
      from high-grade recurrent astrocytomas (Popperl, 2006). Visual analysis of delineation of&#xD;
      glioma showed that the delayed images (imaged first 0-90 min and once or twice later at&#xD;
      180-480 min after injection) better distinguished the high uptake in tumors relative to&#xD;
      uptake in gray matter. SUV comparisons also showed greater uptake in the tumors than in gray&#xD;
      matter, brain, or white matter at the delayed times (Spence et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings support the view that by using FDG-PET scans we could image active areas&#xD;
      within the tumor. Indeed, in vivo, a cancer is made up by different types of cells, including&#xD;
      hypoxic cells, cells that proliferate more fast, as well as by non-malignant tissues,&#xD;
      including inflammatory cells and vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-tumor heterogeneity in malignant glioma is often observed and can be visualised also by&#xD;
      current PET-CT techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dynamics of the tracer uptake in the different tumor sub-volumes may give important&#xD;
      information about the biological characteristics as well. Indeed, the dynamics of FDG uptake&#xD;
      per cell are dependent on the blood flow, the uptake in the cell and the phosphorylation. All&#xD;
      these of these steps give information on the biology of the cancer in that particular area of&#xD;
      the tumor.&#xD;
