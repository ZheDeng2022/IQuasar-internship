      PROJECT TITLE: Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk in Patients with Growth Hormone Deficiency&#xD;
      Following Transsphenoidal Surgery for Nonsecreting Pituitary Adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Recently, an awareness of the risks of hypopituitarism in adults has been raised&#xD;
      by epidemiological studies demonstrating its association with increased mortality, likely&#xD;
      from cardiovascular (CV) causes. In particular, untreated growth hormone deficiency has been&#xD;
      implicated as a possible cause of this increased mortality. A 2004 clinical review of growth&#xD;
      hormone deficiency in adults highlights the plausibility of this argument by citing studies&#xD;
      potentially linking GHD to the following: elevated CRP, LDL and coagulation factor levels,&#xD;
      increased abdominal obesity, increased insulin resistance, increased prevalence of structural&#xD;
      and functional heart disease and increased rates of endothelial cell and large artery&#xD;
      dysfunction. Furthermore, therapy for GH deficiency has been shown to lower total and LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol and reduce visceral fat mass, reduce signs of early atherosclerosis and perhaps&#xD;
      decrease overall risk of myocardial infarction. While these studies suggest that GHD is an&#xD;
      important cardiovascular risk factor, we believe the data are imperfect since some of the&#xD;
      studies chose comparison groups too dissimilar (allowing for the possibility of unrecognized&#xD;
      confounding). Previous studies have assessed cardiovascular risk in patients with&#xD;
      hypopituitarism in comparison to the general population or much younger GH replaced subjects&#xD;
      or GHD patients before and after GH therapy. In contrast, we plan to compare cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk among adult patients rendered growth hormone deficient following surgery for a non&#xD;
      secreting pituitary adenoma versus patients who have undergone the same surgery but who&#xD;
      remain growth hormone sufficient. We plan to test for growth hormone deficiency using the&#xD;
      Arginine/GHRH stimulation test in 80 subjects. We will divide the patients into two groups:&#xD;
      growth hormone deficient and growth hormone sufficient. Once we have recruited enough&#xD;
      patients in each group (thirty), we will compare known CV risk markers and endothelial&#xD;
      function in carefully matched patients from each group. This approach will allow us to&#xD;
      compare similar patients (i.e. all will have undergone surgery, some in each group will have&#xD;
      undergone radiation) whose primary difference will be the GH status. In addition, from each&#xD;
      group we will identify patients with additional pituitary deficiencies in the hope of&#xD;
      comparing patients with either isolated GHD or patients with multiple endocrinopathies to&#xD;
      similar matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least two other novel aspects of our study include the use of magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy to measure intramyocellular and intrahepatic lipids and venous endothelial cell&#xD;
      biopsy to assess endothelial function. Regarding the first modality, elevated levels of&#xD;
      intramyocellular and intrahepatic lipids have been associated with insulin resistance in&#xD;
      other populations. It is our hypothesis that subtle abnormalities in these lipid stores may&#xD;
      correlate with insulin resistance in patients with apparent occult GH deficiency. With regard&#xD;
      to endothelial function, previous work has linked GHD with endothelial cell dysfunction but&#xD;
      typically through indirect measures including serum markers and arterial flow mediated&#xD;
      dilatation. However, a technique has been recently developed to safely sample venous&#xD;
      endothelial cells which in turn will enable us to assess directly at the level of endothelial&#xD;
      cells, oxidative stress, cell activation and nitric oxide synthesis. It is our belief that&#xD;
      this new method will help confirm the contention that GHD alters the basic function of&#xD;
      endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This study will assess the level of cardiovascular risk in two patient&#xD;
      populations: those patients who are GHD following transsphenoidal surgery for nonsecreting&#xD;
      pituitary adenomas and those patients who are not GHD following similar surgery. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be serum markers of cardiovascular risk including lipids, CRP, IL6 and&#xD;
      homocysteine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects for this study will have all undergone transsphenoidal surgery for a nonsecreting&#xD;
      pituitary adenoma. In addition, there may be some additional subjects, who have also&#xD;
      undergone transsphenoidal surgery for a nonsecreting pituitary adenoma, recruited by word of&#xD;
      mouth from the cohort of patients described above. Only patients who are not receiving GH&#xD;
      therapy will be considered. Of those patients who have received RT, only those at least 5&#xD;
      years from radiotherapy will be recruited in order to lessen the likelihood of a false&#xD;
      positive Arginine/GHRH stimulation test which can occur in the early years post RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining respondents will be stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence&#xD;
      of a history of other hypopituitarism: 1) those with &gt; 1 known pituitary hormone deficiency&#xD;
      (other than GH) and who are on replacement for these and 2) those with no known pituitary&#xD;
      hormone deficits. The status of other pituitary hormone replacement therapies will be&#xD;
      verified prior to the arrival of the subjects for further testing. Patients will need to be&#xD;
      on stable doses of replacement therapy for at least 3 months prior to the study visit and if&#xD;
      on hormone replacements they must be on hydrocortisone &lt; 30 mg/day or equivalent and&#xD;
      physiological doses of thyroid and sex steroid replacements. If possible, patients will be&#xD;
      asked to provide copies of their most recent endocrine studies if these were not available&#xD;
      from the chart review to verify the adequacy of their replacement therapy. Any woman known to&#xD;
      be pregnant or any woman of childbearing age with a positive urinary HCG will not be&#xD;
      considered for the study (we will screen all woman of childbearing age at the first visit&#xD;
      prior to initiation of any testing). In addition, any woman actively nursing cannot be&#xD;
      included in the study (we will ask all women of childbearing age at the first visit). We will&#xD;
      recruit equal numbers from these two groups, inviting subjects to our Neuroendocrine Unit for&#xD;
      an initial visit where they will undergo a clinical exam with vital signs, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements and skin fold thickness assessments. Subjects will also undergo GH stimulation&#xD;
      testing with Arginine/GHRH to identify GH deficient (peak GH &lt; 4 µg/L) and nonGH de•cient&#xD;
      (peak GH &gt; 10 µg/L) groups. Lastly, all subjects will have an endothelial cell biopsy&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty matched pairs of patients from the GHD and GH sufficient groups will be contacted&#xD;
      further for an additional visit to our unit for some or all of the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood sampling for CV risk markers including CRP, homocysteine, lipoproteins,&#xD;
           IL6 IGFI and IGFBP3 (all subjects, n=30 pairs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  75 gm OGTT; Insulin and glucose (all subjects, n=30 pairs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan to assess body composition and bone density (all subjects, n=30 pairs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound to assess carotid intimal medial thickness and brachial artery flowmediated&#xD;
           dilatation (subset of subjects, n=10 pairs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance spectroscopy assessment of intramyocellular lipids and intrahepatic&#xD;
           lipids in a subset of each group of the cohort (subset of subjects, n=10 pairs).&#xD;
           Subjects will be studied within 6 months of their initial GH stimulation test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DRUGS Subjects will undergo an Arginine/GHRH stimulation test. They will receive Rgene&#xD;
      (Upjohn) a 10% Arginine Hydrochloride solution in water and Geref Diagnostic (Serono).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SUBJECTS Subjects for the study will include adult patients who have undergone&#xD;
      transsphenoidal pituitary surgery for a nonsecreting pituitary adenoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY LOCATION This study will take place out of the Neuroendocrine Unit, Columbia&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL RISKS Participation in this study will involve minimal standard risks associated&#xD;
      with blood draws. In addition there is a potential risk from exposure to radiation from DEXA&#xD;
      scans. However, the amount of radiation exposure from DEXA scanning is only one percent of a&#xD;
      chest xray and it is in accordance with federal guidelines for this type of research. Given&#xD;
      the risk posed to a fetus from radiation exposure, pregnant or nursing mothers will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. To assess for pregnancy we will chec a urine HCG on all women of&#xD;
      childbearing age prior to initiating any testing. In addition, women of childbearing age will&#xD;
      be asked if they actively nursing and if so they will be excluded from the study. Since the&#xD;
      risk to pregnant or nursing mothers is present only at the time of testing, no additional&#xD;
      precautions against pregnancy need to be taken in the days following our testing. Ultrasound&#xD;
      (for IMT and flow mediated dilatation studies) poses minimal risk beyond mild discomfort from&#xD;
      the gel and probe. MRI also poses minimal risk beyond mild discomfort from the enclosed space&#xD;
      and noise of the machine as long as there is no metal within the scanner room. The subjects&#xD;
      will be asked a series of questions by the MRI technicians to ensure that they are safe to&#xD;
      proceed with MRI. In addition, pregnant woman cannot undergo MRI. The risks of endothelial&#xD;
      biopsy are thought to include pain, inflammation, infection and clots. In a previous study it&#xD;
      was found to be safe but patients will be asked to return one week after the biopsy for&#xD;
      evaluation of the site. If any symptoms arise prior to one week follow up patients will be&#xD;
      advised to call or proceed to the emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common adverse reactions from the administration of arginine include nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, headache, flushing, numbness, local venous irritation. Systemic allergic reaction&#xD;
      is rare but patients with highly allergic tendencies will not be included. Pregnant or&#xD;
      nursing subjects will also be excluded as mentioned above. For GHRH, common side effects&#xD;
      include transient warmth/flushing of face, injection site pain, redness/swelling at site of&#xD;
      injection, nausea, headache, vomiting, strange taste in mouth, paleness, tightness in chest.&#xD;
      A physician will be present throughout the administration of these two drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL BENEFITS The results of the growth hormone stimulation test will be made available&#xD;
      to subjects and their doctors. Therefore, if a subject is found to be growth hormone&#xD;
      deficient, he or she might benefit from growth hormone therapy which has been shown, in some&#xD;
      studies, to improve body composition, cholesterol levels and other factors associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk for cardiovascular disease. A decision to initiate therapy, however should&#xD;
      only occur after a careful discussion between the subject and his or her personal physician&#xD;
      occurs. There may also be some benefit from DEXA scanning as it might identify previously&#xD;
      undiagnosed osteoporosis. This condition has effective treatment options. Lastly,&#xD;
      participation in the study will help further contribute to our understanding of the risk of&#xD;
      heart disease in growth hormone deficient patients.&#xD;
