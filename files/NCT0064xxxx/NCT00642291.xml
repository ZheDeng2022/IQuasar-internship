      To obtain safety and efficacy data for antiretroviral regimens containing emtricitabine in&#xD;
      HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects. To determine emtricitabine concentrations in HIV-1&#xD;
      infected pediatric subjects and, if necessary, to refine the dose of emtricitabine to achieve&#xD;
      concentrations comparable to those in adults given 200 mg emtricitabine once-daily.&#xD;
