    <textblock>
      This Phase One pediatric trial seeks to take advantage of the susceptibility of neuroblastoma&#xD;
      to proteasome inhibitors, proven in vitro, along with the proven in vitro synergy of&#xD;
      bortezomib with irinotecan and the successful Phase One pediatric trials of bortezomib to&#xD;
      create a treatment using these two drugs in combination to treat refractory/recurrent&#xD;
      neuroblastoma in children and young adults 25 and under.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of intensive treatment including high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation and radiation therapy, the long-term survival of patients with&#xD;
      high-risk neuroblastoma remains poor. Patients who experience a relapse of their disease or&#xD;
      fail to achieve complete remission fare even worse. More intense chemotherapy is not the&#xD;
      answer. The development of new drugs with different mechanisms of action are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibitors of the proteasome have created a considerable interest in their use in cancer&#xD;
      chemotherapy, either as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
      The precise mechanism of action for these class of drugs is unclear, however, inhibition of&#xD;
      I-kB degradation by VELCADEÂ® (bortezomib) decreases NF-kB activity in neuroblastoma cell&#xD;
      lines as well as other systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have reported the activity of Irinotecan, a strong Topoisomerase-I&#xD;
      inhibitor, against murine xenografts including those with high-risk features such as MYCN&#xD;
      gene amplification (MYCN is also called V-Myc Myelocytomatosis Viral Related Oncogene,&#xD;
      Neuroblastoma Derived). Irinotecan has also been shown to be active against neuroblastoma&#xD;
      xenografts resistant to vincristine, melphalan, and topotecan, suggesting an alternative&#xD;
      mechanism of resistance to Irinotecan. In vitro synergy between bortezomib and irinotecan has&#xD;
      been documented in pancreatic cancer by others and in neuroblastoma by our group.&#xD;
