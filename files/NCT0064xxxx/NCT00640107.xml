    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic imaging technology that&#xD;
      produces images of the body. This technology does not utilize radiation, as does Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (CT) but relies on radio waves and a strong magnet to produce images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate new commercially available MR imaging sequence&#xD;
      and/or hardware that have been installed on an existing MR unit or to evaluate a new MR unit.&#xD;
      The study also serves to familiarize the MR technical staff with how to operate the new&#xD;
      equipment. The information obtained will be used to optimize new MR equipment that has been&#xD;
      installed on the MR scanner&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are updated ultrasound machines that allow color Doppler images and elastography&#xD;
      acquisition ability. Upgrades for software and hardware are on an ongoing basis along with&#xD;
      new applications and imaging protocols.&#xD;

      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been utilized for 20 years as a clinical and research&#xD;
      tool at SUNY Upstate Medical University. Currently, there are five (5) MR (1 low-field 0.2&#xD;
      Tesla, 3 high-field 1.5 Tesla and 1 3.0 Tesla) units in use on the university campus. During&#xD;
      this time, new imaging sequences and hardware including smaller more powerful magnets and&#xD;
      faster computers have been developed that assist in the diagnosis of many disease processes.&#xD;
      MR Angiography, MR Spectroscopy, diffusion weighted imaging and a dedicated combination&#xD;
      Neurovascular head and neck coil are just several of the many imaging sequences and&#xD;
      specialized coils that have been developed over the last several years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New imaging sequences and hardware including 4.0 and 7.0 Tesla magnets are currently&#xD;
      undergoing development and testing at several universities in the United States and&#xD;
      worldwide. As a consequence of the many new innovations in MR imaging we must periodically&#xD;
      upgrade our existing MR units and on occasion replace one of our existing MR units or&#xD;
      purchase a new MR unit. This will ensure that we have the most up to date MR equipment to&#xD;
      provide state of the art diagnostic imaging capabilities at University Hospital. The new&#xD;
      imaging sequences and/or hardware must be optimized for each MR unit to achieve the highest&#xD;
      signal to noise (SNR) and contrast to noise (CNR) ratios in a reasonable scan time. This&#xD;
      practice is routinely performed at every university and private hospital as well as&#xD;
      outpatient imaging center when a new MR unit is installed and when an existing unit is&#xD;
      upgraded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound imaging has been a component of the Radiology Department since 1975 and used as a&#xD;
      clinical and research tool. Presently our machines include the GE's models: Logic E9, S8,&#xD;
      Logic (, P5, P6, Logic Book, Phillips IU22, SonoSite Turbo (multiple units), Siemens Acuson&#xD;
      (x3 units) and a Siemens X300.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are updated ultrasound machines that allow color Doppler images and elastography&#xD;
      acquisition ability. Upgrades for software and hardware are on an ongoing basis along with&#xD;
      new applications and imaging protocols.&#xD;
