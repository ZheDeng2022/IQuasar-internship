      The purpose of this study is to compare in home support services for patients with COPD with&#xD;
      usual care. The study is designed to evaluate the impact of an interdisciplinary palliative&#xD;
      care team on community based self management of advanced COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of thirty patients will be enrolled into this study. Twenty patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive usual care, and ten patients will be randomly assigned to usual care plus&#xD;
      in home support services. This study will use objective criteria to identify patients with&#xD;
      COPD likely to benefit from home based palliative care services. The patients will undergo&#xD;
      initial assessment by medical, social work, and spiritual care personnel followed by a family&#xD;
      meeting to establish a care plan. Periodic scheduled visits, and as needed unscheduled visits&#xD;
      to address urgent needs will occur over one year's time in an attempt to return patients with&#xD;
      COPD to the center of decision making regarding their care, avoid acute exacerbations and&#xD;
      thereby avoid unscheduled clinic and ER visits. Patients will complete the QOL survey and&#xD;
      symptom assessment scale upon initial intervention. After obtaining information from all&#xD;
      patients who qualify for the study, participants will be randomized into cohorts. Those who&#xD;
      are randomized to serve as cases will be provided with community based self management&#xD;
      services by an interdisciplinary palliative care team. The control group will receive&#xD;
      standard care. At the conclusion of 12 months both cases and controls will again complete the&#xD;
      QOL survey,medical utilization, and symptom assessment.&#xD;
