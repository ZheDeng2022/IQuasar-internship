  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine can achieve a higher&#xD;
      remission rate and a lower subsequent relapse rate in patients with newly-diagnosed&#xD;
      microscopic polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa or eosinophilic granulomatosis with&#xD;
      polyangiitis (Churg Strauss syndrome) with no poor prognosis factor (FFS=0), and without&#xD;
      significantly increasing the rate of adverse events, as compared to corticosteroids alone.&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is a reduction of the absolute risk of treatment failure or relapse&#xD;
      within the first 24 months following initiation of therapy of least 25%.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with new diagnosis of 1) microscopic polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa or&#xD;
      eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg Strauss syndrome) and 2) without any&#xD;
      factor of poor prognosis according to the French five factors score (FFS - including&#xD;
      creatininemia &gt;140µmol/l, proteinuria &gt;1 g/24 h, specific gastro-intestinal involvement,&#xD;
      specific cardiomyopathy, and CNS involvement) can be included at diagnosis or within the&#xD;
      first 15 days following initiation of corticosteroids. Treatment is randomly assigned,&#xD;
      centrally, and received in a double-blinded fashion. It consists in a combination of&#xD;
      azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) and corticosteroids (starting at 1 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks then&#xD;
      progressively tapered over a mean of 50 weeks, varying according to patient's weight) or, for&#xD;
      the control group, the same corticosteroid therapy plus placebo. Duration of azathioprine or&#xD;
      placebo is 12 months, and patients are followed for 12 additional months, yielding in a total&#xD;
      duration of the protocol of 24 months after entry for each patient. End point is the number&#xD;
      of patients who achieve sustained remission and who do not suffer a relapse during the 24&#xD;
      months of the study protocol. Based on the results of the early CHUSPAN trial for similar&#xD;
      patients treated with corticosteroids alone, the cumulative rate of failures and relapses can&#xD;
      be estimated at 40% at 24 months. The primary hypothesis of the CHUSPAN 2 is a reduction by&#xD;
      at least 25% for the rate of this combined parameter of remission-treatment failure and&#xD;
      relapse at 24 months. Based on this hypothesis, using a bilateral test, with a significance&#xD;
      level of 5%, a beta level of 80% and an estimated 5% of lost-of-follow-up, 104 patients must&#xD;
      be included. Secondary end points include the initial remission rate (independently of&#xD;
      subsequent relapses), rate of adverse events and their severity according to the WHO toxicity&#xD;
      grading system, number of deaths, number of patients who could not be weaned of&#xD;
      corticosteroids, area under the curve for corticosteroids, and different scales, such as BVAS&#xD;
      (activity of the disease), VDI (damage), HAQ, SF36, ADL and the evaluation of the need for&#xD;
      health care facilities.&#xD;
