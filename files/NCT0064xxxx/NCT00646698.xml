  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Upper body obese (UBO) subjects are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD) than lower body obese (LBO) or lean. This may in part be caused by greater hepatic&#xD;
      secretion of very-low-density-lipoprotein-triglycerides (VLDL-TG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the impact of body composition and insulin sensitivity on basal VLDL-TG&#xD;
      turnover in women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body composition is an important predictor of obesity related life-style diseases. Thus,&#xD;
      preferential accumulation of adipose tissue in the abdominal region has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be associated with greater risk of developing CVD and insulin resistance than accumulation in&#xD;
      lower body depots. The reason for this is not yet fully understood, but there are indications&#xD;
      that upper body fat depots contain larger and more lipolytically active adipocytes resulting&#xD;
      in an excess hepatic delivery of FFAs in upper body obese individuals. As several lines of&#xD;
      experimental evidence as well as cross-sectional studies have demonstrated, elevated levels&#xD;
      of FFAs affect the cardiovascular system unfavourably and are most likely a major contributor&#xD;
      to insulin resistance. A prominent feature of insulin resistance is hypertriglyceridemia,&#xD;
      primarily caused by increased levels of very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue accounts for the majority (~75 %) of&#xD;
      FFAs delivered to the liver, it is conceivable that excess release from visceral adipocytes&#xD;
      in UBO individuals impacts VLDL-TG secretion. The reason for this is two-sided: First, upon&#xD;
      entry into the liver, FFAs are reesterified to form VLDL-TG which is subsequently secreted.&#xD;
      Studies in cell lines as well as whole body investigations in humans have demonstrated, that&#xD;
      perturbations of FFA levels may directly affect VLDL-TG output by the liver. Second, elevated&#xD;
      levels of FFAs may induce hepatic insulin resistance resulting in increased VLDL-TG output&#xD;
      due to a loss of the inhibitory effect of insulin on VLDL-TG secretion. In theory, this&#xD;
      combination of excess substrate availability coupled with an unfavorable hormonal milieu&#xD;
      (hepatic insulin resistance) could result in increased VLDL-TG production in UBO subjects. A&#xD;
      recent study by Mittendorfer et. al. support this notion, since weight loss in UBO women&#xD;
      resulted in decreased VLDL-TG production, presumably caused primarily by a decrease in the&#xD;
      supply of visceral fatty acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although findings from previous studies have been contradictory as to whether body fat&#xD;
      distribution directly affects VLDL-TG clearance, in vitro findings suggest regional&#xD;
      differences in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity between UBO and LBO women, and VLDL-TG&#xD;
      clearance could also be modulated by differences in VLDL associated fatty acid oxidation. To&#xD;
      our knowledge, the latter point has not previously been addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate differences in VLDL-TG kinetics in&#xD;
      women with different body composition phenotypes. Our preliminary hypothesis was that UBO&#xD;
      women produce and secrete greater amounts of VLDL-TG than their lower body obese (LBO) or&#xD;
      lean counterparts. We also hypothesized, that peripheral clearance would be similar in all&#xD;
      groups. Lastly, we wanted to investigate whether the more benevolent lipid profile seen in&#xD;
      lean women could in part be a result of a more efficient channeling of VLDL derived fatty&#xD;
      acids towards oxidation.&#xD;
