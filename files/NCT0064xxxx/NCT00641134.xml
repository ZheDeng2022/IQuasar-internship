      The goal of this trial is to assess the medium- (6 months) and long-term (12 months) effects&#xD;
      of a Home-Based exercise program after in-Hospital comprehensive Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR)&#xD;
      - as compared with usual care - on exercise capacity, health-related quality of life and&#xD;
      health care services utilization, in patients (pts) older than 75 years after recent acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes or cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data on the short-term efficacy of comprehensive CR are still limited in older pts with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, and no information is available on maintenance of results achieved&#xD;
      with CR over the medium- and long-term periods. As long-term adherence with exercise programs&#xD;
      after comprehensive CR is generally poor, with only 30% reporting regular exercise at&#xD;
      12-month follow-up, guidelines recommend the implementation of methods aimed at improving&#xD;
      adherence with such programs. The applicability to older pts of Home-Based exercise programs&#xD;
      aimed at enhancing the adherence with prescriptions and maintaining the physiological&#xD;
      benefits attained during the in-Hospital training period, is a further issue still to be&#xD;
      clarified. The goal of this study is to determine in pts older than 75 years the medium- (6&#xD;
      months) and long-term (12 months) effects of a Home-Based exercise program after in-Hospital&#xD;
      comprehensive CR, as compared with usual care, on exercise capacity, health-related quality&#xD;
      of life and health care services utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pts older than 75 years who are candidate to an in-Hospital comprehensive CR program after&#xD;
      acute coronary syndromes (ACS), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or cardiac surgery&#xD;
      (coronary artery by-pass graft and/or valvular surgery), will be screened for eligibility in&#xD;
      the trial, and will be enrolled provided they do not meet any of the exclusion criteria. At&#xD;
      baseline, at completion of CR program, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up, the following data&#xD;
      will be assessed in all enrolled pts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  functional capacity, expressed as total work capacity (TWC, watt) and maximal aerobic&#xD;
           capacity (peak VO2, ml/kg/min) during a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  endurance, expressed by the distance covered during a 6-minute walk test (6MWT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lower limb muscular strength, measured with an isokinetic dynamometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  health-related quality of life (SF 36 questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  utilization rates of health care services&#xD;
&#xD;
      At discharge from in-Hospital CR program, pts will be randomly allocated to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Home-Based exercise program, consisting of a prescription of a specific set of exercises&#xD;
           detailed and actively recorded in a log book, with one reinforcement session at the&#xD;
           Rehabilitation Centre each month for the first 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Usual care, consisting of recommendation on usefulness of physical exercise and standard&#xD;
           follow-up visits and functional assessment at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
