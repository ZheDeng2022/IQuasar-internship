      This study will evaluate members in families with a history of small bowel carcinoid cancer&#xD;
      to study the natural history of those family members that have the disease, determine ways to&#xD;
      improve early detection by performing surveillance on those at risk but without disease and&#xD;
      to identify the gene(s) that may cause the tumors. Familial carcinoid tumors usually&#xD;
      originate in hormone-producing cells that line the small intestine or other cells of the&#xD;
      digestive tract. The tumors are slow-growing and usually take many years before they cause&#xD;
      symptoms. It is known that these tumors occur more often in some families and are then passed&#xD;
      from one generation to the next by inherited genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of families, including all siblings and offspring in which two or more immediate&#xD;
      blood relatives have had small bowel carcinoid tumors are eligible for this study. In some&#xD;
      cases unaffected spouses of family members diagnosed with carcinoid cancer are also requested&#xD;
      to participate by donating a sample of blood only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo a medical evaluation every 3 years during a 3- to 5-day hospital stay at&#xD;
      the NIH Clinical Center. All participants have a personal and family medical history obtained&#xD;
      and undergo a physical examination, blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who already have a small bowel carcinoid tumor or are at risk of developing a&#xD;
      carcinoid tumor have some or all of the following procedures to determine the presence of&#xD;
      carcinoid tumor and its (omit next two words- location or) spread to other areas of the body:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Video Capsule Endoscopy: Visualization of the gastrointestinal tract by ingesting a&#xD;
           disposable, &quot;vitamin-pill sized&quot; video capsule that has its own camera and light source.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT of the chest abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast : X-ray examination of the&#xD;
           chest, abdominal and pelvis organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 FDOPA Positron emission tomography (PET) with CT for localization: Nuclear imaging&#xD;
           scan to look at tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI Liver with contrast - to determine if disease has spread to liver&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gallium 68 PET/CT-limited to individuals that have residual tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and research blood work&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should mid gut carcinoid tumors be found every participant will be assisted in determine what&#xD;
      the best course of treatment will be for them.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Carcinoid tumors are rare. In early-stage disease they may cause either no or few nonspecific&#xD;
      symptoms. Therefore, patients with carcinoid tumors most often present late in the course of&#xD;
      their illness when there is already progression to an incurable state as a result of&#xD;
      metastatic disease. At present there are neither practical population screening tests nor&#xD;
      effective therapies and hence the 5-year survival rate is low. Due to the rareness of&#xD;
      sporadic carcinoid tumors, large scale genetic analysis and development of sensitive and&#xD;
      specific diagnostic tests have not been successful. While kindreds with familial carcinoid&#xD;
      tumors that are not ascribable to known genetic syndromes are exceedingly rare, they provide&#xD;
      a unique opportunity to facilitate the identification of the responsible gene mutation. In&#xD;
      addition, the mutated gene in the rare familial form may also underlie the origin of the more&#xD;
      common sporadic occurrence of carcinoid tumors. We propose to study families in which there&#xD;
      are at least two known affected members with carcinoid tumors. We aim to diagnose patients&#xD;
      with early and therefore potentially curable occult disease. Therefore, family members who&#xD;
      have up to a 50% lifetime risk of harboring a carcinoid tumor will undergo an intensive&#xD;
      diagnostic evaluation using biochemical, endoscopic and imaging modalities at initial and&#xD;
      subsequent two year follow up encounters. Early phenotypic assignment of affected family&#xD;
      members and collection of germline and tumoral DNA from multiple kindreds should also&#xD;
      facilitate the genetic analysis leading to the identity of the disease gene. Evaluation of&#xD;
      affected family members at varying stages of disease will contribute to our understanding of&#xD;
      the natural history of carcinoid tumors and the relative utility of a variety of diagnostic&#xD;
      and surveillance tests. Hopefully, such knowledge gained will also be applicable to patients&#xD;
      with carcinoid tumors occurring sporadically or in the setting of other familial cancer&#xD;
      syndromes.There is no planned treatment for patients with existing or newly diagnosed primary&#xD;
      or metastatic carcinoid tumors. However, these patients may be evaluated by consultation with&#xD;
      oncology and surgery for potential treatment on their service under their preexisting&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Adult patients who a) have a present diagnosis of small intestinal carcinoid&#xD;
                  tumor and have at least one blood relation with an immediate or distant family&#xD;
                  member with a documented diagnosis of either small intestinal, pulmonary, kidney&#xD;
                  or gastropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor or metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of&#xD;
                  unknown primary b) do not have a diagnosis of small intestinal carcinoid tumor&#xD;
                  and have at least two immediate or distant family members with documented&#xD;
                  diagnoses of either small intestinal, pulmonary kidney, gastropancreatic&#xD;
                  neuroendocrine tumor or metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of unknown primary or c)&#xD;
                  patients who have multiple synchronous primary small intestinal tumors without a&#xD;
                  known relative with a neuroendocrine tumor of any type. This includes family&#xD;
                  members of patients with carcinoid tumors even if the patients with tumors are&#xD;
                  unwilling to participate so long as we have appropriate documentation confirming&#xD;
                  the diagnosis of the carcinoid tumors in the affected family members. Adult&#xD;
                  patients who are unable to provide informed consent but whose wishes suggest they&#xD;
                  are willing to donate samples for research purposes will be considered for study&#xD;
                  enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Unaffected spouses of patients with a carcinoid tumor and who have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Families with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I, MEN II or other familial tumor&#xD;
             syndromes such as Von Hippel Lindau Syndrome and Neurofibomatosis for which there is a&#xD;
             known genetic predisposition to non-carcinoid tumors as well as carcinoid tumors will&#xD;
             be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnancy, breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Anticoagulation, seizures, severe systemic disease of any sort, advanced metastatic&#xD;
             carcinoid may be relative exclusion criteria prohibiting a full evaluation as&#xD;
             described above under protocol design. However, these medical conditions should not&#xD;
             absolutely exclude participation in the protocol. Participation in each protocol&#xD;
             delineated evaluation procedure will be judged on a case by case basis with patient&#xD;
             safety as the paramount consideration.&#xD;
