      Prospective clinical observational registry study including consecutive patients with&#xD;
      clinical signs or symptoms due to in-stent restenosis (ISR) or definite (ARC criteria) stent&#xD;
      thrombosis (ST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Stent implantation quality (due to technique/problems) are possible major&#xD;
      determinants of ST and ISR in real life practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both early, late, and very late ST, and ISR are important factors for long term outcome after&#xD;
      initial stent implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To elucidate the possible cause(s) of thrombosis or restenosis after stent implantation&#xD;
           in real life practice by clinical, angiographic and IVUS evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the clinical manifestation [stable angina pectoris (AP), unstable AP,&#xD;
           non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or ST-elevation MI] of the index event&#xD;
           (inclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the characteristics of patient, lesion and procedure of the initial&#xD;
           percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the antithrombotic pharmacological therapy preceding the index event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe clinical outcome (death, MI, revascularization, CCS angina class) following&#xD;
           treatment of the index event during 12 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe safety of the IVUS procedure (product or procedural related complications/&#xD;
           malfunctions).&#xD;

      Investigational sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10-15 high volume Nordic PCI centres with experience in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All consecutive patients admitted with an ischemic event due to ST (estimated number of&#xD;
           patients &gt;100) either with BMS or DES.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All consecutive patients with symptoms or signs of ischemia due to in-stent restenosis&#xD;
           with DES (target about 200 patients) and respective BMS patients up to maximum 100&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of patients 400. Control groups 1) Lesions treated during the initial PCI, other&#xD;
      than the index lesion, will be used as control lesions for the stent with failure; ST or ISR&#xD;
      (IVUS findings).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study patients will be compared with a matched population from the Westdenmark Heart&#xD;
           Database to compare the patient characteristics and clinical manifestation during&#xD;
           initial PCI to find out possible differences in patients with and without stent failure&#xD;
           Methods: Detailed description of the characteristics of the patient, lesion and&#xD;
           procedure of the index PCI. Thorough description of the antithrombotic pharmacological&#xD;
           therapy from index PCI to index event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) of index lesion at stent implantation and at the&#xD;
      index event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVUS of the index lesion at the index event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistics A one year workload of 10.000 PCI-patients from 10-15 the participating centres&#xD;
      will constitute the population at risk. With a stent thrombosis (definitive stent thrombosis)&#xD;
      rate of 1,5 % and a clinical restenosis rate of 4 % there will be 150 patients with any stent&#xD;
      thrombosis and 400 patients with any restenosis during a twelve months period. With a DES&#xD;
      penetration rate of 50 % about 75 DES-treated patients will experience a stent thrombosis and&#xD;
      200 patients a restenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval, data registration and analysis The study will be approved by ethical&#xD;
      committees and the data management authorities in the participating Nordic countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be registered in a dedicated case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be expressed as mean value +SD and discrete variables as absolute&#xD;
      values and percentages. Clinical and angiographic variables in the control and index event&#xD;
      groups will be compared using the Student's t- and the chi-square tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Consecutive consented patients with a suspected coronary stent related&#xD;
      clinical event, admitted to one of the participating hospitals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Typical symptoms or evidence of myocardial ischemia (stable AP, UAP/NSTEMI, STEMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical suspicion of ST is based on the ARC criteria (probable ST). ST will be verified&#xD;
           by coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ISR resulting in clinical symptoms/events (angina pectoris, unstable angina, NSTEMI,&#xD;
           STEMI, or documented myocardial ischemia). ISR will be verified by coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVUS will be performed whenever feasible based on the patient's clinical condition. If IVUS&#xD;
      study can not be performed, the above mentioned patients will be included in the initial&#xD;
      registry (to evaluate feasibility of IVUS in real life), while final analysis will be based&#xD;
      on data obtained from patients with IVUS study performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent cannot be obtained. IVUS assessment IVUS will be performed whenever&#xD;
           feasible based on the patient's clinical condition primary to treatment of the index&#xD;
           lesion. If the IVUS catheter cannot be advanced, the lesion may be dilated by a 2 mm&#xD;
           balloon. Mechanical pullback will be used (pull-back speed 0.5 mm/sec). The IVUS&#xD;
           examination will be stored on VHS or CD and send to the IVUS core lab. at Odense&#xD;
           University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All events (technical problems and clinical events) possibly related to the IVUS&#xD;
      investigation will be registered and reported following the standard complaint procedure&#xD;
      process of the manufacturer. In addition, quarterly progress reports (including complaints)&#xD;
      will be provided to the financial supporting company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QCA The angiography obtained during the index lesion PCI-procedure will be used for&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) assessment using a computerized QCA&#xD;
      system (Medis, Leiden, Holland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the index event angiography, there should be at least two cine-runs before the&#xD;
      PCI-procedure and after the procedure with the same angulations as in the index-PCI&#xD;
      procedure. The angiograms will be stored on CD and sent to the angiographic core laboratory,&#xD;
      Skejby Sygehus, University of Aarhus, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points Primary: Angiographic and IVUS findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  procedure related findings at inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tabulation and classification of IVUS and angiographic outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical manifestation of the index event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IVUS procedure related events Compliance to antithrombotic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome of treatment (SR and ST) during the 12 month follow-up: clinical status and&#xD;
           major cardiac events Safety reporting An appropriate safety plan will be established by&#xD;
           the initiating investigator. Relevant procedure, product and study-related events will&#xD;
           be reported following the local regulations. Furthermore, any procedural complications&#xD;
           and other adverse events as defined by the principle investigator and the study team&#xD;
           will be reported to the study coordinator and tracked. The coordinating center and the&#xD;
           principle investigator will review tables and listings of all adverse events from the&#xD;
           study on a regular basis, analyze these for trends, report unexpected adverse device or&#xD;
           procedural events to the appropriate bodies/committees as per local requirements and do&#xD;
           an on-going review of the study to ensure patient safety. The coordinating center will&#xD;
           follow their procedure for document handling and database reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complaint reporting Device malfunctions, device-related adverse events and product&#xD;
      nonconformities will be reported to the appropriate manufacturers following the local product&#xD;
      complaint procedures by all participating site(s). Complaints will also be reported to&#xD;
      regulatory authorities as per local requirements&#xD;
