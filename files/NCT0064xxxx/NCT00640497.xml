  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a combination of two T-cell directed antibodies both conjugated to a&#xD;
      cell-killing toxin will be evaluated. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that this&#xD;
      so-called immunotoxin-combination (IT-combination) acts synergistically in eliminating T&#xD;
      cells. In a subsequent clinical pilot-study, the IT-combination has generated encouraging&#xD;
      results when applied as third line therapy. Extensive biological and clinical responses could&#xD;
      be noted in the absence of severe acute toxicities. Building on this experience, the current&#xD;
      study aims at evaluating the characteristics of the IT-combination when administered in an&#xD;
      earlier phase of the disease, i.e. as second line instead of as third line therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;The experimental design is a non-controlled multicentric fixed-dose Phase I/II study. A&#xD;
      total of 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled in 4 transplant centers throughout the&#xD;
      Netherlands, in a 9 to 12 months period. The treatment consists of a standard dose of 4&#xD;
      infusions IT-combination (4 mg/m2), given 48-hours apart over a 4-hour period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intended follow-up period is 12 months. The patient will also be asked to participate in&#xD;
      additional research aiming at determining the presence and evolution of biomarkers suggestive&#xD;
      for the extent to which the IT-combination 'resets the T-cell compartment, induces clinical&#xD;
      tolerance, and/or enhances the risk of over-immunosuppression.&quot;&#xD;

    <description>The treatment consists of a standard dose of 4 infusions of IT-combination (4 mg/m2), given 48-hours apart over a 4-hour period. The IT-combination is a combination of two immunotoxins. One immunotoxin is a mAb anti-CD3 conjugated to recombinant ricin A chain and the other immunotoxin is a mAb anti-CD7 conjugated to recombinant ricin A chain.</description>
