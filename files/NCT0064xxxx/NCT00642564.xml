      The purpose of this study is to collect data from patients who are diagnosed with epilepsy&#xD;
      and are followed up in epilepsy clinics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headaches and epilepsy are chronic disorders with episodic manifestations characterized by&#xD;
      recurrent attacks of nervous system dysfunction with a return to baseline between attacks.&#xD;
      Although it is not uncommon that patients with epilepsy suffer from headaches, the relations&#xD;
      between seizures and headaches is multi-factorial. Headaches may occur immediately before&#xD;
      (preictal), during (ictal), or after (postictal) a seizure. In addition to seizure-associated&#xD;
      headaches, patients often experience headaches that are not temporally related to&#xD;
      seizures-interictal headaches. Moreover, epidemiological studies indicate an association of&#xD;
      migraine and epilepsy with an increased prevalence of migraine in patients with epilepsy. Up&#xD;
      to now, there is still limited information about the relationship between the frequency of&#xD;
      seizure attacks and headache occurrences. Thus, we purpose this study to investigate the&#xD;
      incidence of headaches, to explore the relationship between seizure attacks and headache&#xD;
      occurrences, to classify the headache, and to document the frequency, characteristics, and&#xD;
      effects of migraine and headaches among patients with epilepsy. This study is a multi-centre&#xD;
      survey to collect data from patients who are diagnosed with epilepsy and are followed up in&#xD;
      epilepsy clinics. Patients can only participate in this study after signing and dating the&#xD;
      inform consents. There are two stages of this study: Stage I: On enrollment, data on&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, epilepsy profile, seizure frequencies, and epilepsy treatment&#xD;
      would be obtained. Body weight and height would be measured. Information of prior headache&#xD;
      occurrences and their relationships with seizures would also be collected. Stage II: Patients&#xD;
      enrolled into this study will be divided into three group: patients who are seizure free for&#xD;
      past 6 months, patients with &gt; 1 attack every month within past 6 months, and other patients.&#xD;
      Participants of each group will be enrolled into Stage II for 24-week follow-up. Information&#xD;
      of seizure attacks, headache occurrences, and treatment will be collected. This is an&#xD;
      observational study and no study drug is administered.&#xD;
