  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a risk-reduction program in preventing the&#xD;
      transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases among African-American heterosexual&#xD;
      couples, with one partner having been previously diagnosed with an HIV infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV, is a major public&#xD;
      health concern, especially among minority groups in the United States. Although STDs are&#xD;
      prevalent across all racial and ethnic groups in the United States, the rate of STD infection&#xD;
      is disproportionately higher for African Americans than for white Americans. African&#xD;
      Americans have higher rates of HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and herpes than white&#xD;
      Americans. An important part of the prevention process is early education on HIV to reduce&#xD;
      sexual-risk behavior and to promote safe sexual practices. Interventions are needed in a&#xD;
      variety of settings to extensively address African Americans' risk of STDs, including HIV.&#xD;
      Although most HIV/STD risk-reduction interventions are conducted at the individual level, a&#xD;
      couple-based approach may be more effective and consistent with cultural values. This study&#xD;
      will compare the effectiveness of the Eban HIV/STD Risk Reduction Intervention with the Eban&#xD;
      Health Promotion Intervention in reducing the risk of STDs among African-American&#xD;
      HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 12 months. All participants will first undergo baseline&#xD;
      assessments that will consist of questionnaires and biospecimen collection for STD testing.&#xD;
      Participants will then be assigned randomly to one of two treatment groups: the Eban HIV/STD&#xD;
      Risk Reduction Intervention group or the Eban Health Promotion Intervention group. Both&#xD;
      groups will participate in weekly 2-hour sessions over 8 weeks. The sessions will include&#xD;
      couple and group sessions led by trained male and female co-facilitators. The Eban HIV/STD&#xD;
      Risk Reduction Intervention sessions will focus on the couple and will teach the couple about&#xD;
      communication skills. The approach will draw upon social cognitive theory, an ecological&#xD;
      framework, and HIV/STD risk-reduction research with inner-city African-American populations.&#xD;
      The Eban Health Promotion Intervention sessions will focus on the individual and will provide&#xD;
      factual information on health, screening, exercise, diet management, and medication&#xD;
      adherence. Follow-up visits for all participants will occur at Months 3, 6, and 12 and will&#xD;
      include repeat baseline assessments.&#xD;
