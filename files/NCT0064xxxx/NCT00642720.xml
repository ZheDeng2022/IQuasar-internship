      Study Synopsis Study Title: Double blind, single centre, cross-over study on the effects of&#xD;
      weekly subcutaneous administration of 40 mg pegvisomant or placebo on quality of life and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity in acromegalic patients with normal serum IGF-I concentrations during&#xD;
      long-term treatment with long-acting somatostatin analogs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether the addition of weekly pegvisomant administrations improves quality&#xD;
           of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether the addition of weekly pegvisomant administrations improves insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Acromegalic patients, who have normalized their serum IGF-I levels down to&#xD;
      the upper 25 centiles of normality during long-term treatment with monthly injections of a&#xD;
      long-acting somatostatin analogue Number of Subjects: 20&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on treatment with Sandostatin LAR (SL) 20 - 30 mg per months i.m. or patients&#xD;
           on treatment with Lanreotide autosolution (LA) 90 - 120 mg deep s.c. will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 4 months, all subjects will also receive weekly s.c. injections of either placebo or&#xD;
           a fixed dose of 40 mg pegvisomant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After a 4 weeks wash-out period, patients will switch from either placebo to pegvisomant&#xD;
           or from pegvisomant to placebo&#xD;

      Introduction Both lanreotide (Somatulin Autosolution ™ (SL)) and octreotide (Sandostatin LAR&#xD;
      ™ (LAR)) are equally effective in controlling disease activity in acromegalic subjects with a&#xD;
      normalization of serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels in roughly 65%. However,&#xD;
      SL is injected as a deep intramuscular injection, while LA is injected as a deep subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection. Physicians, involved in the treatment of acromegalic patients know that&#xD;
      biochemical control of the disease in their patients not necessarily means that all those&#xD;
      patients stop complaining. To address these issues, Sonino and co-workers studied with&#xD;
      several symptom questionnaires the effects on quality of life (QoL) of SL. Together with a&#xD;
      significant decrease in growth hormone (GH) and IGF-I, treatment with SL significantly&#xD;
      improved psychological distress, well-being and social fears (1). In another study on the&#xD;
      efficacy of the novel GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant to lower serum IGF-I concentrations&#xD;
      a questionnaire evaluating five clinical signs and symptoms of acromegaly showed dose&#xD;
      dependent significant differences from placebo (2). Recently, Webb and co-workers reported&#xD;
      the successful development of a disease-specific questionnaire suitable to measure&#xD;
      health-related quality of life in acromegaly (ACROQOL) (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No clear biochemical parameter appears to be available that correlates well with disease&#xD;
      activity related quality of life (4). At the same time, serum GH concentrations and serum&#xD;
      total IGF-I levels, but not QoL, are used as parameters to determine dosing of Sandostatin&#xD;
      LAR, or any of the available medical therapies for acromegaly (5-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growth hormone receptor antagonist pegvisomant as monotherapy once daily normalizes IGF-I&#xD;
      in virtually all acromegalics (9;10), but pegvisomant monotherapy is also very costly.&#xD;
      Recently, we reported the results of a 42-week dose-finding study on the efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination of long-acting somatostatin analogues once monthly and pegvisomant once weekly in&#xD;
      26 patients with active acromegaly. Pegvisomant dose was increased until IGF-I levels&#xD;
      normalized or until a weekly dose of 80 mg was reached. IGF-I levels normalized in 25 (95 %)&#xD;
      with a median weekly dose of 60 mg pegvisomant. There were no signs of pituitary tumor growth&#xD;
      but mild elevations in liver enzymes were observed in 10 patients (38%) (11). One of the&#xD;
      potential advantages of combining pegvisomant with somatostatin analogues is that pegvisomant&#xD;
      monotherapy improves insulin sensitivity compared to somatostatin analogues (12;13), although&#xD;
      it is unclear yet whether or not long-term pegvisomant administration would improve insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in normal subjects (13;14). Therefore, one might expect that pegvisomant&#xD;
      monotherapy has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, compared to the combination of&#xD;
      both pegvisomant and somatostatin analogues, as the latter ones decrease insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      by several mechanisms (13;15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  So-called biochemically well controlled acromegalic subjects with normal serum IGF-I&#xD;
           concentrations frequently still have an impaired QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These subjects, when controlled by long-acting somatostatin analogs have impaired&#xD;
           insulin sensitivity because of the pharmacological properties of these somatostatin&#xD;
           analogs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We postulate that co-administration of the growth hormone receptor antagonist&#xD;
           pegvisomant will improve QoL and insulin sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;

        2. To determine whether the addition of weekly pegvisomant administrations improves insulin&#xD;
