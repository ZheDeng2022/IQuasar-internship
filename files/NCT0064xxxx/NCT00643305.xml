      The purpose of this study is to determine whether motivational interviewing and skills&#xD;
      building interventions reduce HIV risk behavior for adults with serious and persistent mental&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term objective is to reduce the incidence of HIV for people with serious and&#xD;
      persistent mental illness (SMI) by developing an effective primary and secondary HIV risk&#xD;
      reduction intervention for this population which can be easily delivered in the &quot;real world&quot;&#xD;
      settings in which patients routinely receive care. Research findings document that the&#xD;
      incidence of HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases, and sexual and drug use behaviors&#xD;
      are high among people with serious mental illness, as evidenced by rates of HIV infection and&#xD;
      other sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs). A variety of factors underlie risky behaviors for&#xD;
      the SMI, including cognitive impairment, poor judgment, affective instability and&#xD;
      impulsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skills-building (SB) HIV risk reduction interventions, typically delivered in a small group&#xD;
      formats, have had modest success in increasing HIV-related knowledge and improving risk&#xD;
      reduction skills for people with SMI, although these effects are transient. As&#xD;
      skills-building interventions are currently the standard of care in most research and&#xD;
      clinical settings for HIV prevention, it is important to identify new ways to augment these&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A relatively new and promising addition to the armamentarium of individualized interventions&#xD;
      is Motivational Interviewing (MI). MI is an approach designed to reduce ambivalence and&#xD;
      enhance intrinsic motivation to change problematic behaviors. Previous researchers have noted&#xD;
      effects for both SB and MI interventions independently, however, these effects tend to be&#xD;
      fairly modest. Integrating these approaches in a systematized way allows us to test the&#xD;
      degree to which this combination is useful, given that both motivation and skills are clearly&#xD;
      important in effecting health behavior change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific primary aims are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To adapt SB and MI interventions for HIV risk reduction for men and women with serious&#xD;
           and persistent mental illness (SMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interventions for HIV risk reduction for people with SMI are typically offered in a&#xD;
           group format and focus primarily on skills-building. We have developed and refined a&#xD;
           brief, individually-tailored skills-building intervention (SB Intervention), based on&#xD;
           these existing manuals. We have also adapted and refined a brief individually-tailored&#xD;
           Motivational Interviewing intervention to target HIV risk behaviors, incorporating&#xD;
           skills-building techniques analogous to those in the SB intervention, resulting in a&#xD;
           Motivational-Interviewing &amp; Skills-Building Intervention (SB-MI Intervention).&#xD;
           Adaptation and refinement of the SB and SB-MI interventions was informed by consulting&#xD;
           with experts in MI, SMI, and HIV risk reduction, eliciting feedback from advisory boards&#xD;
           of providers and consumers, and conducting feedback interviews with participants who&#xD;
           have completed participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To pilot test and obtain preliminary data with regard to the feasibility of our&#xD;
           interventions and the differences in outcome associated with our SB and SB-MI&#xD;
           interventions for reduction of HIV-related risk behaviors in a cohort of SMI adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comparison of SB and SB-MI interventions in the proposed pilot study will allow us to&#xD;
           assess the degree to which incorporation of motivational techniques are helpful in&#xD;
           augmenting skills-building interventions for HIV risk reduction for people with SMI.&#xD;
           These preliminary analyses will inform our need to refine the adapted interventions (SB&#xD;
           and SB-MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To offer HIV counseling and testing for at-risk individuals with SMI, with an emphasis&#xD;
           on connecting participants to appropriate medical and mental health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To date, increasing rates of HIV counseling and testing for the SMI has not been a&#xD;
           primary focus of clinical research, which we believe to be a significant public health&#xD;
           deficit. As part of both of our interventions we are providing information about HIV&#xD;
           counseling and testing services to those participants not identified as HIV-seropositive&#xD;
           and encouraging them to access these services. We are then tracking the degree to which&#xD;
           participants follow up on these referrals as part of our follow-up evaluations. This&#xD;
           will allow us to test the degree to which our interventions are helpful in increasing&#xD;
           rates of HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To begin to explore the relationships between participant characteristics, HIV risk&#xD;
           behaviors, and response to our interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the unique features of our intervention is that it assumes an individually-tailored&#xD;
      approach, which can address unique patient characteristics inherent in a heterogeneous&#xD;
      sample. Indeed, using a heterogeneous sample greatly facilitates our primary long-term&#xD;
      objective, which is to develop useable interventions that can be adapted in real-world&#xD;
      settings. This project will allow us to begin to identify those characteristics that are&#xD;
      likely to be associated with more positive outcomes (i.e. greater risk reduction, increased&#xD;
      rates of HIV testing).&#xD;
