    <textblock>
      This research study investigates whether the ability of aspirin to reduce the risk of heart&#xD;
      attacks may be diminished by the administration of acetaminophen. Patients who have heart&#xD;
      disease are often prescribed aspirin because of its unique ability to permanently prevent&#xD;
      platelets from aggregating and forming a blood clot. Such blood clots cause heart attacks&#xD;
      when they form in a blood vessel that supplies the heart with oxygen rich blood. Some of&#xD;
      these same patients also take acetaminophen everyday for relief from arthritis pain. Higher&#xD;
      doses of acetaminophen may also have the ability to prevent the platelets from clotting,&#xD;
      however only temporarily. Therefore, this study evaluates whether the timing of the&#xD;
      administration of acetaminophen (before or after aspirin) interferes with the permanent blood&#xD;
      clotting effects of aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that acetaminophen given two hours before aspirin will antagonize&#xD;
      the effects of aspirin, while reversing the order of administration will not.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acetaminophen has antipyretic and moderate analgesic properties, but largely lacks&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory activity. While its mechanism of action is not entirely understood, it is&#xD;
      probably both an isoform nonspecific and partial cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor in humans at&#xD;
      doses commonly taken for mild pain and pyrexia, such as 1000 mg. Although no inhibition of&#xD;
      platelet aggregation is observed at this dosage, platelet thromboxane formation by COX is&#xD;
      depressed by roughly 40%. Epidemiological studies suggest that at higher doses, 2000 mg and&#xD;
      above, acetaminophen exhibits a gastrointestinal adverse effect profile indistinguishable&#xD;
      from traditional, nonspecific NSAIDs. Thus, it is possible that maximal COX inhibition is&#xD;
      achieved at higher doses. Interestingly, complete COX inhibition by non-selective COX&#xD;
      inhibitors has the potential to antagonize the irreversible platelet inhibition induced by&#xD;
      aspirin. In contrast to reversible inhibitors, aspirin acts by acetylation of a serine&#xD;
      residue in the substrate binding channel of COX. For example, ibuprofen, a reversible and&#xD;
      non-selective COX inhibitor, is thought to prevent aspirin from gaining access to this target&#xD;
      site. This study investigates, whether COX inhibition by acetaminophen is dose dependent in&#xD;
      humans and whether acetaminophen interacts with the irreversible COX inhibition by low dose&#xD;
      aspirin. It addresses the dose-related effect of acetaminophen on COX activity and assesses&#xD;
      potential pharmacological interactions with low dose aspirin in normal healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that administrating acetaminophen before aspirin would antagonize&#xD;
      the irreversible effects of aspirin, as assessed by the measurement of serum thromboxane B2&#xD;
      24 hrs after the administration of the first study drug on day 6 of combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim will determine the effects of acetaminophen on oxidant stress and&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase activity in patients who smoke. While the structural interaction of&#xD;
      acetaminophen with COX is unknown, it may inactivate the enzyme by a molecular mechanism&#xD;
      different from other NSAIDs. Thus, acetaminophen, which is a good reducing agent, might act&#xD;
      to reduce COX from its active, oxidized form. When uninhibited, the peroxidase component of&#xD;
      this bifunctional enzyme oxidizes its catalytic center to generate a tyrosyl radical that is&#xD;
      required for its activity. Indeed, some reducing agents have the capacity to prevent COX&#xD;
      activation in vitro. If reduction were the basis for COX inhibition by acetaminophen in vivo,&#xD;
      it would be expected to be less pronounced under conditions of high peroxide tone, as occurs&#xD;
      in inflammation. Indeed, acetaminophen, which is a phenol derivative, may act as a free&#xD;
      radical scavenging antioxidant like other phenolic compounds, such as vitamin E and has been&#xD;
      shown to alleviate oxidative damage in model systems. This study explores the potential&#xD;
      antioxidant effect of acetaminophen in smokers. Such individuals represent a human model of&#xD;
      oxidant stress. Novel approaches to the quantitative assessment of free radical induced&#xD;
      damage to lipids are applied, which are elevated in smokers. Additionally, it is determined&#xD;
      whether COX inhibition by acetaminophen is conditioned by oxidant tone in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third aim, will compare the degree of COX inhibition by acetaminophen with that of a&#xD;
      thoroughly characterized nonselective COX inhibitor, ibuprofen.&#xD;

    <description>Thromboxan B2 is a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2. Thromboxane B2 formation during clotting of whole blood (37 degrees Celsius, 1 hour) is reflective of the capacity of platelets to form thromboxane A2. Serum Thromboxane B2 was measured by radio-immuno assay. The quantity of interest was percent change from start (8:00 am on day 1) to finish (8:00 am on last day) of each crossover period in serum thromboxane B2. This was calculated as: 100%*(value at start of period minus value at end of period)/value at start of period.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Serum Thromboxane B2</title>
        <description>Thromboxan B2 is a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2. Thromboxane B2 formation during clotting of whole blood (37 degrees Celsius, 1 hour) is reflective of the capacity of platelets to form thromboxane A2. Serum Thromboxane B2 was measured by radio-immuno assay. The quantity of interest was percent change from start (8:00 am on day 1) to finish (8:00 am on last day) of each crossover period in serum thromboxane B2. This was calculated as: 100%*(value at start of period minus value at end of period)/value at start of period.</description>
