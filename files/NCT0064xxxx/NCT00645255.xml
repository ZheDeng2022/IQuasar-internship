        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be able to communicate meaningfully with the investigator, be legally&#xD;
             competent, provide written informed consent, and follow a specified diet and exercise&#xD;
             program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must be nonlactating and must either be a) at least one year&#xD;

             oophorectomy or hysterectomy; or c) using adequate contraceptive precautions (i.e.,&#xD;
             oral contraceptives, approved hormonal implant, intrauterine device, diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide, condom with spermicide).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A serum pregnancy test, which must be negative, is required of all females except&#xD;
             those who are surgically sterile or postmenopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have a systolic blood pressure &lt;=140 mmHg, a diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure&lt;=90 mmHg, and a pulse rate &lt;=95 beats per minute (see Section VI.I.). Treated&#xD;
             hypertensives are allowed in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have been enrolled in a nonpharmacologic weight loss program with&#xD;
             documented weight loss of &gt;=10 kg maintained for at least 6 months, have gained back&#xD;
             &lt;50% of their peak lost weight (while currently maintaining a weight loss of &gt;=10 kg),&#xD;
             and be stabilized on a weight-maintaining diet for at least 1 month prior to&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's body mass index (BMI) must be &gt;=27 kg/m2 and &lt;=40 kg/mg2, rounded to the&#xD;
             nearest whole unit, and must have been &gt;=30 kg/m2 prior to initiation of the&#xD;
             nonpharmacological weight loss program prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have lived in the immediate geographic area for at least 2 years&#xD;
             prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the subject is on chronic medication, the dose must have been constant for at least&#xD;
             two months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject must not have a history of clinically significant cardiac disease, any&#xD;
             clinically significant abnormal cardiac condition, or be known to have a clinically&#xD;
             significantly abnormal ECG. Specifically excluded conditions include coronary artery&#xD;
             disease, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must not have a history of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must not have a history of narrow angle glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must not have an organic cause of obesity (e.g., untreated&#xD;
             hypothyroidism).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must not have a history of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must not have severe renal or hepatic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must not be using any of the following medications while taking study&#xD;
             medication: monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, phenelzine, procarbazine&#xD;
             HCl, selegiline), lithium, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, opioids (e.g.,&#xD;
             dextromethorphan, meperidine, pentazocine, fentanyl), prescribed or over-the-counter&#xD;
             weight loss agents, centrally acting appetite suppressants, tryptophan, migraine&#xD;
             agents (e.g., sumatriptan succinate, dihydroergotamine) or any other medication that,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Investigator, may pose harm to the subject, obscure the effects&#xD;
             of study medication or interfere with the process of drug absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism, or excretion (i.e., enzyme inducers or enzyme inhibitors). The regular use&#xD;
             of sympathomimetics (e.g. cough and cold remedies, asthma medication) is&#xD;
             contraindicated during the study. Study medication should be discontinued for 3 days&#xD;
             before the use of opioids. THE SUBJECT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN OFF ANTIDEPRESSANTS IN&#xD;
             ORDER TO BE PLACED IN THE STUDY.&#xD;
&#xD;
