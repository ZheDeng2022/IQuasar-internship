  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular risk appears to be linked to some degree with inflammation. HIV medications&#xD;
      have been linked with cardiovascular risk. In this study we will be measuring levels of&#xD;
      chemicals in the body associated with inflammation before and after starting HIV medications&#xD;
      in patients with HIV. We hope to understand what happens to these chemicals once a patient&#xD;
      with HIV is started on these medications to understand their role in cardiovascular risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of antiretroviral therapy, death due to opportunistic diseases have seen a&#xD;
      major decline among patients with HIV. However, several antiretroviral medications, in&#xD;
      particular protease inhibitors (PI), have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      in large cohort studies. The role of inflammation in cardiovascular risk is currently being&#xD;
      elucidated. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been identified as a strong&#xD;
      independent predictor of cardiovascular disease among healthy individuals in several large&#xD;
      cohort studies. Other inflammatory biomarkers such as serum amyloid A (SAA) and interleukin-6&#xD;
      (IL-6) have also been correlated with cardiovascular risk. Among patients with HIV, studies&#xD;
      have revealed inappropriate immune activation with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines such&#xD;
      as IL-6, IL-10, interferon-γ (IFN- γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The effects of&#xD;
      this immune dysregulation and the impact of antiretroviral therapy on the cytokines and&#xD;
      biomarkers associated with cardiovascular risk remain to be delineated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Our aims are to characterize the levels of inflammatory biomarkers at the time of&#xD;
      antiretroviral initiation, to define the time period over which the biomarkers change and&#xD;
      stabilize, and to determine if the type of antiretroviral drug class used has an impact on&#xD;
      the rate of alteration of these biomarkers. Given the disparate cardiovascular risk between&#xD;
      women and men of similar age groups, we will study the additional impact of gender on these&#xD;
      biomarkers. We will also explore whether there is a correlation between change of CD4&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte counts and the response of the biomarkers.&#xD;
