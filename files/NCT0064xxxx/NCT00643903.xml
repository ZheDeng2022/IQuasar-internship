      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral coping training in&#xD;
      improving side effect management and treatment adherence in HIV-infected patients who are&#xD;
      taking antiretroviral medications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV is a virus that is transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, primarily through&#xD;
      sexual intercourse. HIV infections can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a&#xD;
      disease that breaks down the immune system and allows for entry of life-threatening secondary&#xD;
      infections. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven to effectively inhibit the replication of&#xD;
      HIV and has resulted in a reduction in HIV-related deaths. People infected with HIV who are&#xD;
      receiving ART, however, may be confronted with negative physical and emotional side effects.&#xD;
      These side effects can impact quality of life (QOL), adherence to medical care, and decisions&#xD;
      about health care. Stress and Coping Theory (SCT) is a person-centered approach that&#xD;
      considers stressful experiences as person-environment transactions. A cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      treatment based upon SCT may help to eliminate or reduce the negative impact of side effects,&#xD;
      improve QOL, and maximize benefit from treatment among people living with HIV. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral coping training in improving side&#xD;
      effect management and treatment adherence in HIV-infected people who are taking ART&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve two phases. Phase 1 will be conducted over 12 months and will include&#xD;
      two 1-hour interviews with questions about personal life, family, friends, medications, and&#xD;
      medication side effects. After the first interview, participants may be invited to&#xD;
      participate in Phase 2, which will last 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 2, participants will complete five 2- to 3-hour interviews occurring at baseline&#xD;
      and Months 3, 6, 12, and 18. Interviews will include questions about personal life, friends,&#xD;
      family, health-related activities, drug-using behaviors, emotions, mental state, and&#xD;
      educational background. Participants will be assigned randomly to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 participants will receive five individual sessions of cognitive behavioral&#xD;
           coping training, beginning after the Month 3 interview. The 90-minute sessions will&#xD;
           focus on coping with stress, dealing with medication side effects, and staying on track&#xD;
           with medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 participants will receive standard care and one group session of coping&#xD;
           training, which will be held after the Month 18 interview. The group session will cover&#xD;
           the same material that is covered in the individual sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last follow-up interview, some participants may also be asked to complete an exit&#xD;
      interview about thoughts and feelings on study participation.&#xD;
