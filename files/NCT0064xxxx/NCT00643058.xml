      (IRB# Pro00005035)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine the role of nitric oxide (NO) in asthma and to&#xD;
      characterize the symptoms associated with inhaled endotoxin in normal subjects. The effect of&#xD;
      inhaled endotoxin on exhaled NO is determined in healthy African Americans, with and without&#xD;
      NOS2 promoter polymorphisms. The protocol involves the use of NIH Clinical Center Reference&#xD;
      Endotoxin which has been approved by the FDA under IND BB-IND-10035.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background &amp; significance: Asthma is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for&#xD;
      African Americans and asthma is increasing in prevalence. Both environmental and genetic&#xD;
      factors contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma. In addition to allergens, environmental&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin plays an important role in the chronic inflammation&#xD;
      associated with asthma. There is convincing evidence that endotoxin exacerbates airflow&#xD;
      obstruction and airway inflammation in allergic asthmatics. Endotoxin increases inducible&#xD;
      nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production in vitro and in vivo&#xD;
      in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In asthma, NOS2 expression is upregulated in several cell types including bronchial&#xD;
      epithelium, macrophages and other inflammatory cells. The increase in NOS2 expression is&#xD;
      associated with increases in exhaled NO in individuals with asthma as compared to healthy&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prompted our search for NOS2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the subsequent&#xD;
      identification of three NOS2 promoter SNPs. Two of the SNPs are associated with increased&#xD;
      systemic NO levels. Another SNP creates a predicted binding site for the human homolog of&#xD;
      delta EF1, which is a transcriptional repressor and we predicted that this SNP would be&#xD;
      associated with low NO levels. Importantly, the three NOS2 promoter SNPs are not linked, do&#xD;
      not segregate together and are present primarily in individuals of African ancestry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; procedures: The study of exhaled NO levels in individuals with asthma is confounded&#xD;
      by the presence of cell types besides bronchial epithelium that produce NO, by differences in&#xD;
      the severity of asthma and by the use of medications such as corticosteroids which alter&#xD;
      exhaled NO levels. Therefore, in this protocol exhaled NO levels are measured in asymptomatic&#xD;
      healthy African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty individuals (10 individuals with each polymorphism) who are heterozygous for a NOS2&#xD;
      promoter SNPs and 10 individuals without these NOS2 promoter SNPs will be studied. The&#xD;
      decision to study 10 individuals in each group was based on a power analysis (80% power, 0.05&#xD;
      alpha) using available data on NO levels in normal individuals following endotoxin challenge.&#xD;
      Because basal NO levels in patients with asthma are approximately twice that of normal&#xD;
      individuals, we decided that a two-fold difference in exhaled NO levels following endotoxin&#xD;
      challenge represents a meaningful difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general design of this study is to identify healthy nonasthmatic, nonatopic, never&#xD;
      cigarette smokers with no history of airway reactivity, and subject them to a specific&#xD;
      incremental challenge with inhaled LPS to determine the airway reactivity to inhaled&#xD;
      endotoxin. Upon recruitment, each study subject will be scheduled for seven separate visits,&#xD;
      with the option of 3 additional visits after each challenge. During the initial visit, each&#xD;
      study participant will undergo a thorough clinical evaluation including 2 questionnaires, a&#xD;
      physical examination, skin tests to assess the presence of atopy, full pulmonary function&#xD;
      testing, a chest x-ray, an EKG, and a methacholine challenge test to assess airway&#xD;
      hyperreactivity, exhaled nitric oxide and exhaled breath condensate samples to measure&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators. During the challenge visits, each subject will undergo a specific&#xD;
      incremental challenge with inhaled endotoxin or the vehicle (saline). The initial evaluation&#xD;
      and the endotoxin inhalation challenge will be separated by a minimum of two weeks. A brief&#xD;
      follow up visits will be scheduled to collect blood samples, exhaled gases 24, 48, 72hours&#xD;
      and 7 days after endotoxin challenge and to obtain full pulmonary function testing with&#xD;
      airway resistance performed at baseline. To avoid problems with diurnal variation in&#xD;
      pulmonary function, all testing sessions will begin at 8:00 AM. All testing will be performed&#xD;
      in the Rankin Duke Clinical Research Unit at Duke University. Serum pregnancy testing will be&#xD;
      performed during the initial visit and the days of each endotoxin and saline inhalation&#xD;
      challenge to exclude pregnant women from this study. Administration of endotoxin or saline&#xD;
      will not occur until results of the pregnancy test have returned negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to serum pregnancy testing, blood samples will be obtained to determine IgE&#xD;
      levels (to determine whether subject has allergies; determined at visit 1 only), cotinine&#xD;
      levels (a metabolite of nicotine and used to determine whether subject smokes; determined at&#xD;
      visits 1, 2, 4 and 6), CRP and cytokine levels (markers of inflammation used to determine&#xD;
      whether systemic responses to inhaled endotoxin occur; determined at visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and&#xD;
      7), and RNA levels (to be analyzed using gene arrays and used to determine whether systemic&#xD;
      responses to inhaled endotoxin occur; determined at visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). On visits 2,&#xD;
      4 and 6, CRP, cytokine and RNA levels will be determined three times, initially to establish&#xD;
      baseline levels and 2 and 6 hours after endotoxin or saline challenge. On visits 3, 5 and 7,&#xD;
      CRP, cytokine and RNA levels will be determined once. The URI questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered at the beginning of all visits to assess whether subjects have symptoms&#xD;
      consistent with a URI or cold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Duke Investigational Pharmacy will prepare the inhaled solution of endotoxin according to&#xD;
      a standard protocol which has been used successfully by other investigators, as well as in&#xD;
      our own laboratory. Each subject will receive an initial dose of Saline Solution as a&#xD;
      baseline. During the second visit, inhalations will contain increasing concentrations of&#xD;
      endotoxin (Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin (CCRE), a lot of endotoxin prepared from the&#xD;
      bacterial strain E. Coli O:113 and maintained by the Pharmaceutical Development Service,&#xD;
      Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health) according to the&#xD;
      following schedule: 5,000 EU (endotoxin units); 10,000 EU; and 20,000 EU. During the higher&#xD;
      dose challenge visit, inhalations will contain 40,000 EU and 80,000 EU of endotoxin.&#xD;
      Following inhalation of each dose of endotoxin or each saline challenge, we will obtain&#xD;
      several spirometric measures of airflow. Airflow will be assessed 1, 10, 20, and 30 minutes&#xD;
      following each dose of inhaled LPS or saline. If the study subject's FEV1 is more than 80% of&#xD;
      the baseline measurement, the inhalation challenge will continue and the next higher dose of&#xD;
      endotoxin will be administered. During the control visit, saline control will be administered&#xD;
      on three occasions. After each dose of inhaled endotoxin or saline, non-pulmonary adverse&#xD;
      events will be assessed and graded. The protocol will conclude if any of the following&#xD;
      criteria have been met: 1) subject does not wish to continue for any reason; 2) subject's&#xD;
      FEV1 has decreased 20% from baseline saline inhalation; 3) total dose of 35,000 units (low&#xD;
      dose challenge visit) or 120,000 units (high dose challenge visit) has been achieved; or 4)&#xD;
      the subject experiences any adverse event rated as severe or any other adverse event deemed&#xD;
      significant in the opinion of the investigator. Following completion of the inhaled endotoxin&#xD;
      or saline challenge, pulmonary function studies, vital signs and symptom assessments will be&#xD;
      performed to assess the safety of the inhaled endotoxin procedure (see attached IND protocol&#xD;
      for details). We will also collect exhaled breath condensate samples to measure inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators including leukotrienes and to control for the confounding effects of airway&#xD;
      inflammation on exhaled NO levels. Exhaled breath condensate will be collected from subjects&#xD;
      by having them breathe normally for approximately 10 minutes into an apparatus that traps&#xD;
      condensation by cooling the exhaled breath. We will measure airway resistance at 1, 2, 6 and&#xD;
      24 hours after endotoxin or saline challenge. Measurement of spirometry, lung volumes,&#xD;
      diffusing capacity will be repeated at 6 hours and 24 hours post challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure exhaled NO levels using an online chemiluminescent detector (Sievers 280i)&#xD;
      prior to and 1, 2 and 6 hours after endotoxin or saline challenge. We will also measure&#xD;
      exhaled NO levels 24 hours after exposure to endotoxin or saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be requested to come for additional optional physiologic measurements at 48, 72&#xD;
      and 168 hours post challenge to gather data further in the time course. For the optional&#xD;
      visits after each challenge, subjects will have vital signs measured, CRP and serum for other&#xD;
      inflammatory markers drawn. Subjects will perform spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing&#xD;
      capacity, exhaled NO levels, airway resistance, and complete a short questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a separate related IRB protocol prior to the above study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, (IRB # Pro00005046) we will determine the effect of promoter polymorphisms in the&#xD;
      gene for the NO producing enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), on exhaled NO in healthy&#xD;
      African Americans. Individuals consented during Phase 1 will be asked if they are willing to&#xD;
      be contacted about future studies including those described in Phase 2 of this study. 30&#xD;
      individuals (10 individuals with each polymorphism) identified in Phase 1 who are&#xD;
      heterozygous for a NOS2 promoter SNPs and 10 individuals without these NOS2 promoter SNPs&#xD;
      will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because SNPs in the TLR4 gene result in a lack of airway obstruction in response to&#xD;
      endotoxin, we will genotype the 1000 DNA samples for the Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile TLR4&#xD;
      polymorphisms in Phase 1 and exclude these individuals from the studies proposed in Phase 2.&#xD;
      Likewise, CD14 serves as a coreceptor for endotoxin and polymorphisms in the CD14 gene and&#xD;
      promoter have been associated with asthma and responsiveness to endotoxin. Therefore, to&#xD;
      control for this potential confounder in our analysis, we will also test whether&#xD;
      polymorphisms in the CD14 gene and its promoter are associated with responsiveness to inhaled&#xD;
      endotoxin.&#xD;
