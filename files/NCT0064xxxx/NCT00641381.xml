      RATIONALE: Giving high-dose chemotherapy drugs, such as carmustine, etoposide, and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells that were&#xD;
      collected from the patient's blood are returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming&#xD;
      cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of giving high-dose carmustine,&#xD;
      etoposide, and cyclophosphamide together with a stem cell transplant and to see how well it&#xD;
      works in treating patients with HIV-associated lymphoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of high-dose chemotherapy comprising&#xD;
           carmustine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide followed by autologous stem cell infusion in&#xD;
           patients with HIV-associated lymphoma receiving combination anti-HIV therapy and to&#xD;
           determine the efficiency of stem cell collection from these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate HIV viral load, CD+4/CD+8 counts, and immune recovery after high-dose anti-&#xD;
           lymphoma chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of high-dose etoposide in patients receiving highly&#xD;
           active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for&#xD;
      transplantation. At least 5 days later, patients with an adequate number of collected cells&#xD;
      proceed to high-dose chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-dose chemotherapy: Patients receive carmustine IV over 4 hours on days -7 to -5,&#xD;
           etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -4, and cyclophosphamide IV on day -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autologous PBSC transplantation: Patients receive PBSC infusion on day 0. Patients&#xD;
           undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies of etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at approximately 30 days and 100&#xD;
      days, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV seropositive at or before the time of lymphoma diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be on a multi-drug regimen (excluding azidothymidine) to maintain HIV&#xD;
             viral load less than 50,000 Gc/mL; if the CD4 count at enrollment is less than 100&#xD;
             then the viral load should be less than 10,000 by reverse transcriptase polymerase&#xD;
             chain reaction (Rt-PCR); if the CD4 count is greater than 100/mm^3 prior to the start&#xD;
             of any lymphoma chemotherapy and is greater than 100/mm^3 for at least 3 months then&#xD;
             the viral load must be less than 150,000 gc/ml and clinically stable; if no&#xD;
             pre-chemotherapy CD4 counts are available, then viral load alone will be used from&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The known hematopoietic toxicity of AZT (zidovudine) prohibits its use pre-transplant&#xD;
             during stem cell collection and during the immediate period of engraftment&#xD;
             post-transplant; resumptions of AZT should not begin until there is evidence of stable&#xD;
             engraftment; therefore, AZT should not be resumed until at least 2 months after last&#xD;
             blood product support is used; since platelet support continues until approximately&#xD;
             day +14 days in our experience with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)&#xD;
             patients transplanted date, AZT will be prohibited until at least 2 months after&#xD;
             transplant; therefore, if the anti-HIV drug combination needs to be modified then AZT&#xD;
             can be part of the new regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biopsy proven intermediate grade or high-grade Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, (working&#xD;
             formulation groups D-H and J, and Plasmablastic lymphoma of any disease state,&#xD;
             including first remission given the poor risk nature of this histology) or Hodgkin's&#xD;
             lymphoma of any subtype except nodular lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&amp;H) lymphocyte&#xD;
             predominant; tissue histology will be reviewed at the City of Hope&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior marrow involvement must demonstrate &lt; 10% involvement (by&#xD;
             morphology) pre stem cell collection&#xD;

          -  Pretreatment serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic&#xD;
             pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are Hepatitis C antibody positive or Hepatitis B surface antigen positive&#xD;
             without clinical evidence of cirrhosis will be eligible after further evaluation;&#xD;
             specifically, if patient hepatitis C or B positive viral loads will be measured;&#xD;
             patients with hepatitis B and ongoing evidence of viral replication may require&#xD;
             therapy prior to receiving high dose chemotherapy; this decision will be at the&#xD;
             discretion of the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal and a 24 hour urine&#xD;
             creatinine clearance &gt; 60 cc/min&#xD;

          -  Prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 2 x normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or diffusing capacity of the lung for&#xD;
             carbon monoxide (DLCO) &gt;= 50% predicted&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  If female of child bearing potential, must have negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be on a prophylactic regimen for pneumocystis pneumonia if the CD4&#xD;
             counts are &lt; 200&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are not in complete remission must have measurable disease; measurable&#xD;
             disease means that there are bidimensionally measurable lesions with clearly defined&#xD;
             margins using either a medical photograph, computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan or&#xD;
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or palpation of lesions with both diameters &gt;=&#xD;
             2 cm; evaluable disease means that the lesions are only unidimensionally measurable,&#xD;
             or have indistinct margins or have both diameters &lt; 0.5 cm, or that the palpable&#xD;
             lesions have a diameter &lt; 2.0 cm, or are lesions in bone; pleural effusions and&#xD;
             ascites are considered nonevaluable disease; scans must be within 28 days from&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
