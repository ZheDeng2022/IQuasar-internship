  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide data on the response over 24 months to two commercial weight loss&#xD;
      programs (center-based and telephone-based) compared to control conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first study aim is to test, in a randomized controlled trial, whether participation in&#xD;
      the multifaceted traditional center-based commercial weight loss intervention program and/or&#xD;
      the telephone-delivered commerical program is associated with a greater degree of weight loss&#xD;
      at six, 12, and 18 months and whether weight loss is maintained over a 24-month period in&#xD;
      overweight or obese women, compared to usual care or control conditions. This study utilizes&#xD;
      a randomized study design with subjects assigned to the center-based weight loss program,&#xD;
      telephone-delivered program, or a usual care control group. The second study aim is to&#xD;
      describe the effect of participation in the weight loss programs (versus control conditions)&#xD;
      on circulating lipids (fasting total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol), carotenoids&#xD;
      (a biomarker of vegetable and fruit intake), insulin, glucose, leptin, C-reactive protein,&#xD;
      and vitamin D, and cardiopulmonary fitness. The center-based intervention involves in-person&#xD;
      counseling and obtaining food items from the center, whereas the telephone-delivered program&#xD;
      involves telephone counseling with food delivered to the home every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims of this study involve describing the characteristics associated with greater&#xD;
      weight loss and maintenance in each of the two intervention arms. The hypothesis to be tested&#xD;
      is that selected participant characteristics, such as older or younger age, might be&#xD;
      differentially associated with greater success across the two types of programs and&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, the results of this study would contribute valuable data to the scientific knowledge&#xD;
      base regarding the various modalities of communication for behavioral interventions&#xD;
      (in-person versus telephone counseling). This is an important issue currently being&#xD;
      considered and debated among clinical and community-based behavioral and nutritional&#xD;
      scientists whose intervention efforts focus on promoting behavior change and positive effects&#xD;
      on health-related outcomes such as weight reduction.&#xD;
