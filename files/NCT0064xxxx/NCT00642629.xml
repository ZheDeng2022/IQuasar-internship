  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is not fully clear how rheumatoid arthritis originates and develops, but it is understood&#xD;
      that multiple genetic and environmental factors interact to trigger its onset. The immune&#xD;
      system attacks the joint synovium, which damages the cartilage and bone in the joint by&#xD;
      increasing the number of inflammatory cells and forming new blood vessels in the joint space.&#xD;
      STA-5326 mesylate inhibits the production of IL-12 and IL-23 and therefore may inhibit Th-1&#xD;
      cytokine production. A reduction in the Th-1 response has the potential to minimize or&#xD;
      eliminate joint damage caused by the immune response in rheumatoid arthritis. This study is&#xD;
      designed to assess whether the proposed mechanism of action is associated with a reduction in&#xD;
      inflammation in the synovium of patients who have rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male or female 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of RA in conformance with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)&#xD;
             criteria for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has at least one knee, wrist, or ankle that has active synovitis and is amenable to&#xD;
             arthroscopic procedures for the acquisition of synovial tissue via biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be taking methotrexate for a minimum of 4 months prior to Day 1, with a stable&#xD;
             dose regimen for at least 2 months, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have plans to remain on the stable dose regimen of methotrexate for the duration of&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female of childbearing potential, must be neither pregnant nor breast feeding, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  must have a negative pregnancy test (serum β-hCG) within 1 week of Day 1. Must be&#xD;
             willing to use &quot;double-barrier&quot; contraception methods for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is taking any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) other than MTX&#xD;
             concomitantly or within 1 month prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive (≥10 mm) tuberculin (PPD) skin test, unless the patient has had prior BCG&#xD;
             immunization or has received prior suppressive treatment such as 1 year of INH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received any investigational drug or experimental procedure for the treatment of&#xD;
             RA within 3 months of Day 1 for a biologic compound or within 1 month of Day 1 for a&#xD;
             non-biologic compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has any clinically significant disease (e.g., renal, hepatic, neurological,&#xD;
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, psychiatric, hematologic, urologic, or other&#xD;
             acute or chronic illness) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the&#xD;
             patient an unsuitable candidate for this trial.&#xD;
