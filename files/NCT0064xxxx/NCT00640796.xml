  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern frontline therapy for patients with hematologic malignancies is based on intensive&#xD;
      administration of multiple drugs. In patients with relapsed disease, response to the same&#xD;
      drugs is generally poor, and dosages cannot be further increased without unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicities. For most patients, particularly those who relapse while still receiving frontline&#xD;
      therapy, the only therapeutic option is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). For&#xD;
      those who relapse after transplant, or who are not eligible for transplant because of&#xD;
      persistent disease, there is no proven curative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is mounting evidence that NK cells have powerful anti-leukemia activity. In patients&#xD;
      undergoing allogeneic SCT, several studies have demonstrated NK-mediated anti-leukemic&#xD;
      activity. NK cell infusions in patients with primary refractory or multiple-relapsed leukemia&#xD;
      have been shown to be well tolerated and void of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) effects.&#xD;
      Myeloid leukemias are particularly sensitive to NK cells cytotoxicity, while B-lineage acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are often NK-resistant. We have developed a novel method&#xD;
      to expand NK cells and enhance their cytotoxicity. Expanded and activated donor NK cells have&#xD;
      shown powerful anti-leukemic activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and&#xD;
      T-lineage ALL cells in vitro and in animal models of leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study represents the translation of these laboratory findings into clinical&#xD;
      application.We propose to determine the safety of infusing expanded NK cells in pediatric&#xD;
      patients who have chemotherapy refractory or relapse hematologic malignancies including AML,&#xD;
      T-lineage ALL, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML),&#xD;
      juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML),myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), Ewing sarcoma family&#xD;
      of tumors (ESFT) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). The NK cells used for this study will be&#xD;
      obtained from the patient's family member who will be a partial match to the patient's immune&#xD;
      type (HLA type).&#xD;

      Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the in vivo lifespan and phenotype of the&#xD;
      expanded NK cells and explore the efficacy of these donor NK cells in study participants with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies or sarcomas.&#xD;
