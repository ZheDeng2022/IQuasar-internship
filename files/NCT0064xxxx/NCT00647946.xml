  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous study substituting zidovudine or stavudine to abacavir in patients with severe or&#xD;
      moderate lipoatrophy has shown an increase in limb fat by DEXA. This study was conducted over&#xD;
      a 24-week period and although improved outcomes were documented by objective measures, DEXA&#xD;
      scans, subjective observation did not correspond. Longer-term follow up of these patients is&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 48 week study is designed to compare the substitution of the thymidine analogues&#xD;
      zidovudine (ZDV) or stavudine (D4T) with either tenofovir DF or abacavir, in patients treated&#xD;
      with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and show improved outcomes on total limb&#xD;
      fat mass, improved body shape by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans and improved cholesterol and triglycerides.&#xD;

      This is a phase II, open-label, multicentre, randomised, two-arm study of 48 weeks duration.&#xD;
      One hundred HIV infected individuals who have documented lipodystrophy at &gt; 1 body/facial&#xD;
      site and currently receiving zidovudine (ZDV) or stavudine (d4T) will be recruited.&#xD;
