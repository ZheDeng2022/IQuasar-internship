      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the immunogenicity of a single dose of Influenza&#xD;
      Vaccines (0.5mL or 0.25mL) in healthy children aged up to 35 months or 36 up to 48 months. To&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 0.25mL IM of injection influenza vaccines in&#xD;
      healthy children aged up to 35 months; to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single&#xD;
      0.50mL IM injection of influenza vaccines in healthy children aged up to 48 months.&#xD;

    <description>This phase II, observer-blind, parallel groups, single center, extension study will be performed over a period of approximately 6 months in a study population of healthy children up to 48 months of age.&#xD;
Up to two hundred and forty-four children (244) having previously participated in Novartis Vaccines Study V70P2 will be vaccinated with the same influenza vaccines received in the previous trial.&#xD;
Each subject will receive a single vaccine dose of 0.25mL, or of 0.5mL, if aged respectively up to 35 months or 36 up to 48 months, administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle, preferably of the non-dominant arm.</description>

             recommendations: routine vaccines or any other vaccines not foreseen in the protocol&#xD;
             can be given after the active trial phase (i.e. 4 weeks after last vaccination in the&#xD;
             respective season) has been concluded;&#xD;
&#xD;
