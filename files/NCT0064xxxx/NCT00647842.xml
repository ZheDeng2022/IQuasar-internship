  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was primarily to investigate the bioequivalence and secondly to&#xD;
      assess the wearability (adhesion) and acute irritation of Mylan fentanyl transdermal system&#xD;
      with and without an overlay system following a single 25 µg/hr application worn for 72 hours.&#xD;

                  start of the study and on the evening prior to each dose administration. If&#xD;
                  dosing is scheduled on weekends, the HCG pregnancy test should be given within 48&#xD;
                  hours prior to dosing of each study period. An additional serum (beta-HCG)&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Women of childbearing potential must practice abstinence or be using an&#xD;
                  acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. No&#xD;

                       least one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Women will not be considered of childbearing potential if one of the following is&#xD;
                  reported and documented on the medical history:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. postmenopausal with an absence of menses for at least one (1) year, or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy and an absence of&#xD;

                  women of childbearing potential must use a spermicide-containing barrier method&#xD;
                  of contraception in addition to their current contraceptive device. This&#xD;
                  requirement should be documented in the informed consent form.&#xD;
