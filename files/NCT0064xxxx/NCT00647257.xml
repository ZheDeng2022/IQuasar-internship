      This is a an investigator-initial, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group&#xD;
      comparative study to evaluate the effect on the incidence of AF and pacemaker dependence in&#xD;
      SSS patients receiving physiological atrial-based pacing alone or adding losartan 100mg to&#xD;
      physiological atrial-based pacing treatment. The duration of the study will be approximately&#xD;
      13 months, comprising 4-week pre-study period, and 12-month treatment period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sick sinus syndrome is a common indication for permanent cardiac pacing in the community. It&#xD;
      results from disordered impulse generation within the sinus node or impaired conduction of&#xD;
      the impulse to the surrounding atrial tissue, thus leading to the clinical manifestation of&#xD;
      bradycardia. In patients with SSS, AF frequently develops after pacemaker implantation,and&#xD;
      progresses to persistent AF over long term follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of AF have been shown to be an independent predictor for major cardiovascular&#xD;
      events in SSS patients receiving physiologic pacing. Recent prospective clinical trials have&#xD;
      demonstrated that physiologic pacing mode reduces the risk of AF compared to single chamber&#xD;
      ventricular pacing in patients with SSS. However, the effectiveness of physiologic pacing in&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of AF in patients with sinus node dysfunction is still incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One recent clinical study had reported that 68% of SSS patients with a DDDR pacemaker have&#xD;
      atrial tachyarrhythmias detected by the pacemaker devices at median 718 days follow-up.&#xD;
      Modern pacemakers have diagnostic features that permit the detection and storage of&#xD;
      information about the date, time of onset, and duration of multiple, sequential episodes of&#xD;
      atrial tachyarrhythmias. Since a high percentage of AF episodes may be asymptomatic, AF&#xD;
      &quot;burden&quot; have been used as surrogate end points. Prolonged P wave, shortened refractoriness,&#xD;
      or remarkably abnormal conduction disturbances in the presence of prolonged refractoriness&#xD;
      limit the effectiveness of standard physiologic pacing in AF prevention. This could explain,&#xD;
      at least in part, the tendency of SSS to develop AF as a part of its natural history.&#xD;
      Clinical electrophysiology has focused the attention on the electrophysiological and&#xD;
      structural properties of the atrial muscle in patients with SSS: shortened and inhomogeneous&#xD;
      refractoriness and local and regional conduction slowing, as well as prolonged intra- and&#xD;
      inter-atrial conduction disturbances, are well described as increased interstitial fibrosis&#xD;
      associated with the genesis of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing body of evidences has shown that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system can&#xD;
      prevent the promotion of AF by suppressing the development of atrial fibrosis and structural&#xD;
      remodeling. At present, the influence of a treatment target aiming on altered fibrosis and&#xD;
      structural substrate in patients with SSS is not yet known. One striking result of the&#xD;
      losartan intervention for endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study was that new-onset&#xD;
      AF and associated stroke were significantly reduced by losartan- compared to atenolol-based&#xD;
      antihypertensive treatment with similar blood pressure reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relative risk of new-onset AF in losartan group is 0.67 compared to atenolol group (i.e.;&#xD;
      33% risk reduction) Therefore, there is every reason to believe that blocking the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin pathway with angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade would have positive&#xD;
      influence on AF burden in this clinical setting. Recently, enalapril has been reported to&#xD;
      prevent rapid atrial pacing (4 weeks)-induced interstitial fibrosis and fatty degeneration of&#xD;
      the sinus node and to improve sinus node function in canine model, supporting the important&#xD;
      role of structural changes of sinus node in the regulation of sinus node function. This&#xD;
      possibility supporting therapeutic interventions using RAS inhibitors forms an attractive&#xD;
      theoretical basis for interventions to reverse SND in such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In support of these hypotheses, the present study was undertaken to determine whether&#xD;
      selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade with high dose losartan was effective in&#xD;
      reducing AF burden, pacemaker dependence, shortening of sinus node recovery time, hsCRP, and&#xD;
      NT-pro BNP, and associated cardiovascular events in SSS patients receiving physiologic&#xD;
      pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, all pacemakers are standard rate-adaptive dual chamber pacemakers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medtronic Kappa 900 or Versa. At implantation, all patients were programmed to DDI mode at 50&#xD;
      ppm to minimize the ventricular pacing. All patients had the atrial tachyarrhythmia detection&#xD;
      feature programmed &quot;on&quot; after pacemaker implantation. This feature provides information on&#xD;
      the date, time of onset, and duration of the first 15 consecutive episodes of an atrial&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmia. This information can be retrieved during follow-up visits using the&#xD;
      pacemaker programmer.Patients were evaluated every 3 months after pacemaker implantation. At&#xD;
      each visit, the atrial tachyarrhythmia diagnostic data were retrieved. Each episode&#xD;
      classified as an atrial tachyarrhythmia was reviewed by one of the investigators.&#xD;
      False-positive detections of AF due to oversensing were excluded using specific rules&#xD;
      developed in the course of previous clinical trials. On review of the beat-to-beat intervals&#xD;
      stored in the diagnostic counters during an episode classified as AF, far-field oversensing&#xD;
      was defined if&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Long intervals between successive detected atrial events were paced and short intervals&#xD;
           were sensed; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The difference between the first, third, fifth, and seventh atrial intervals and the&#xD;
           second, fourth, sixth, and eighth intervals was &gt; 150 beats/min; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The sum of the long and short interatrial intervals was equal to the interatrial&#xD;
           intervals recorded before or after termination of the episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The atrial tachycardia detection feature in the Medtronic Kappa 900 or Versa was used for AF&#xD;
      detection in this study. This feature has been reported to have a high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity for the detection of atrial tachyarrhythmias. All atrial leads were bipolar. The&#xD;
      atrial sensitivity was programmed to 0.5 mV, which is the standard clinic protocol. The&#xD;
      programming parameters for AF detection included a post-ventricular atrial blanking period of&#xD;
      150 msec, a tachycardia detection rate of 180 beats/min, the number of beats for atrial&#xD;
      tachycardia detection of 200, the number of beats for tachycardia termination of 10, and the&#xD;
      diagnostic arrhythmia counter was frozen in order to collect information on the first 15&#xD;
      tachycardia episodes. These parameters were selected to optimize the detection of AF and to&#xD;
      reduce the likelihood that nonsustained AF would fill the diagnostic counters. AF episodes &lt;&#xD;
      1 minute in duration were not detected as an episode of AF. To maximize collection of&#xD;
      sequential episodes of AF, the atrial electrogram storage feature was not used. In the Kappa&#xD;
      900 or Versa, an electrogram can be retrieved for the first episode of AF detected (if the&#xD;
      episode occurs within a programmable time) and, in these cases, the electrogram was reviewed&#xD;
      to ensure appropriate classification of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustained AF was defined as an atrial tachyarrhythmia with an atrial rate &gt; 250 beats/min and&#xD;
      duration &gt; 1 minute. The atrial rate was determined based on review of the interatrial&#xD;
      intervals stored in the device diagnostics during each episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AF burden was defined as the quantity of AF documented during the follow-up period and&#xD;
      expressed as a portion of the follow-up period (hours/day). When the event counters were&#xD;
      filled, AF burden was calculated as the total duration of AF during the time required to fill&#xD;
      the counters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permanent AF was defined as AF present at two consecutive visits and an AF burden of 24&#xD;
      hours/day between those visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSNRT at pacemaker implant and each visit :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) was assessed at CLs of 600, 500 and 400 ms&#xD;
      after a 30-second pacing train from the atrial lead. The measurement of CSNRT was repeated 3&#xD;
      times, and averaged. Atrial-based pacemaker dependence Pacemaker dependency was defined as&#xD;
      the absence of escape or intrinsic rhythm for at least 30 seconds after gradual slowing of&#xD;
      the pacing rate to 30 beats/min. Pacemaker dependency was examined every 3 months.&#xD;
      Measurement of Intrinsic Heart Rate Pacing system follow-ups, including measurements of&#xD;
      pacing/sensing characteristics, lead impedance, and surveillance of battery status were&#xD;
      performed every 3 months in each patient. Endocardial atrial and ventricular electrograms&#xD;
      were recorded via a programmer with the pacing mode temporarily set to AAI at a lower rate of&#xD;
      30 beats/min. A temporary programmable function that allows markers to appear on the&#xD;
      programmer's electrocardiographic recording, corresponding to spontaneous events sensed by&#xD;
      the pulse generator, was used to measure the rate of intrinsic or escape rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pacing rate was manually step-downed to 30 beats/min in every 10 beats/min from the lower&#xD;
      pacing rate, and intrinsic or escape rhythms were checked at each pacing rate. A fixed pacing&#xD;
      rate of 30 beats/min following the gradual decrease was maintained for at least 30 seconds to&#xD;
      allow the emergence of intrinsic or escape rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 220 male and female patients, aged 20 to 80 years, with SSS will be enrolled&#xD;
      and randomly assigned to the losartan add on physiological atrial-based pacing or&#xD;
      physiological atrial-based pacing alone treatment arm. The sample size was calculated to&#xD;
      provide the study with 80% power for a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Assuming a 33%&#xD;
      reduction of AF incidence rate in the losartan group compared with physiological pacing only&#xD;
      group after 1 year after randomization. Based on these assumptions, the total sample size&#xD;
      required was estimated to be 100 patients in each arm. Thus we need to enroll 220 eligible&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication (losartan) will be in tablet form. Patients randomized to the losartan arm&#xD;
      will receive 50 mg once a day for 2 weeks, patients will then be up-titrated to 50 mg of&#xD;
      losartan twice a day following the first 2-week therapy. Each patient will be assessed&#xD;
      following 4 weeks of losartan therapy at this dose. If the patient is well tolerated for this&#xD;
      dose they will be maintained on it for the remaining time of the study. If they are unable to&#xD;
      tolerate this target dose they will be permitted to down-titrate and continue on the highest&#xD;
      tolerated dose. Only those patients able to tolerate at least the lowest dose of losartan&#xD;
      will be permitted to continue on study until the end of study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normotensive patients who weigh less than 50 kg, or who are aged over 70 years will receive&#xD;
      25 mg/day for the first 2 weeks, then increase to 50 mg/day, with the aim of reaching 100&#xD;
      mg/day for the rest of the study.&#xD;
