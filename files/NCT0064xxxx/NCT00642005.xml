    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery allows surgeons to remove bowel via small incisions. To allow insertion&#xD;
      of a camera and instruments, cold and dry gas is blown into the abdominal cavity. This&#xD;
      project investigates the use of warmed, humidified gas in laparoscopic surgery. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that this will result in less damage to internal surfaces, and shorten recovery&#xD;
      time. Previous studies have demonstrated positive outcomes in laparoscopic gallbladder&#xD;
      operations. The investigators plan to study patients undergoing laparoscopic colon&#xD;
      operations, as these operations are longer and the effect of humidification will be&#xD;
      magnified. The investigators will enroll 74 patients: 37 will have the operation with cold&#xD;
      dry gas, and 37 will have warm, humidified gas. The investigators will measure intraoperative&#xD;
      heat loss, postoperative pain, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and time to return of bowel&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

      The key determinants of a return to normal activity after major colorectal surgery are pain&#xD;
      and fatigue. Our research group has an interest in enhancing perioperative care to reduce&#xD;
      postoperative fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have investigated the effect of peritoneal inflammation and the local production of&#xD;
      cytokines on fatigue. Our data indicate that there is an association between the development&#xD;
      of postoperative fatigue and the concentration of peritoneal cytokines following colorectal&#xD;
      surgery. (Paddison, Hill - manuscript in submission). It is known that following surgery,&#xD;
      there are two possible modes of communication between the cytokines and the brain. One is a&#xD;
      hormonal routine by which the cytokines produced at the site of surgery enter the blood and&#xD;
      proceed through cell surface receptors to act directly on the brain. The second method is a&#xD;
      neural route represented by paracrine action of cytokines on primary afferent neurons that&#xD;
      innervate the body site where the injury has taken place. In the abdominal cavity, the vagus&#xD;
      nerve plays an important role in the latter form of communication. Vagal sensory neurons&#xD;
      express large numbers of receptors for immune derived mediators, including a number of&#xD;
      cytokines involved in inflammation and it has been shown that a major function of vagus may&#xD;
      involve signaling immune and inflammatory situations. The vagus is unique as it has&#xD;
      termination at the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brain. The NTS is intensely&#xD;
      activated following peripheral immune challenges and is also by far the most sensitive area&#xD;
      in the brain following immune stimulation. The NTS projects monosynaptically to many regions&#xD;
      of the brain which mediate sickness responses. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been found in&#xD;
      the blood, the skin, and the central nervous system after surgery and injury, however&#xD;
      following major abdominal surgery such as colectomy these cytokines are found in very high&#xD;
      concentrations in the peritoneal cavity. This local production of cytokines is far in excess&#xD;
      of the amounts found in the serum suggesting an important local role and potentially a&#xD;
      significant role in metabolic changes associated with colonic surgery. Therefore,&#xD;
      inflammation and the consequent production of large concentrations of cytokines at the site&#xD;
      of the surgery may activate the rich neurosensory vagal afferents to stimulate regions of the&#xD;
      brain which mediate &quot;sickness&quot; responses. Therefore, it is feasible to hypothesize that&#xD;
      strategies which lead to a reduction of the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines will&#xD;
      lead to a reduction in post-operative fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In laparoscopic surgery, insufflated CO2 is delivered as defined by the United States&#xD;
      Pharmacopoeia and National Formulary, which requires impurity of less than 200 parts per&#xD;
      million, including water vapor. It is delivered at room temperature (21Â°C) with a relative&#xD;
      humidity approaching 0%. Heat is lost by the body in warming and humidifying the cold, dry&#xD;
      gas 1, and animal models have demonstrated that this can induce hypothermia. Initial human&#xD;
      investigations showed that by simply heating the insufflating gas, core temperature was&#xD;
      maintained and pain scores were improved. Additional findings showed heating and&#xD;
      humidification helped to maintain core temperature in a porcine model 4. There is clinical&#xD;
      evidence suggesting that heating and humidification can increase intraoperative core body&#xD;
      temperature and reduce post-operative use of analgesia and pain scores for up to 14 days&#xD;
      postoperatively. This intervention has also been linked significantly to an earlier return to&#xD;
      normal activity in patients undergoing cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental studies have also shown that humidified gas is associated with less peritoneal&#xD;
      and systemic inflammation compared to unhumidified gas. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that use of warm, humidified gas is associated with a reduction in the concentration of&#xD;
      peritoneal IL-6. The magnitude of this change is even larger than the effect seen after&#xD;
      administration of anti-inflammatory agents in a similar setting. Significant reduction in&#xD;
      other inflammatory peritoneal cytokines (TNF, IL-1) have also been observed in patients&#xD;
      undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with warmed CO2 insufflation gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no studies which have examined the effect of humidification in patients&#xD;
      undergoing laparoscopic colonic surgery. We hypothesize that use of warm, humidified&#xD;
      insufflation gas will lead to a reduction in hypothermia and concentration of peritoneal&#xD;
      cytokines, with consequently decreased post-operative pain and fatigue, and earlier return to&#xD;
      normal bowel function and activity. Our aim is to design and execute a double-blinded&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial to test this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from out-patient clinics across all three Auckland public&#xD;
      hospitals. On the day of the operation, using opaque envelopes and computer generated random&#xD;
      numbers; patients will be allocated into 2 groups. The intervention group will receive warm,&#xD;
      humidified insufflation gas and control group will receive standard dry gas. Other&#xD;
      intraoperative variables will be standardized and controlled. The patients, operating&#xD;
      surgeons and other members of the clinical team will be blinded to the treatment given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the data from a previous study measuring post-operative pain following colonic surgery;&#xD;
      37 patients are required in each group in to provide a 20% reduction in post-operative in&#xD;
      hospital opiate use with alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8. In order to achieve the required&#xD;
      numbers we aim to enroll all patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy from North Shore,&#xD;
      Auckland and Middlemore Hospitals. Exclusion criteria:Patients under 15 years, acute cases,&#xD;
      stoma formation (preop or intraop decision, decision to change to open surgery preoperatively&#xD;
      (intraop conversions will be included as intention to treat), rectal lesions defined as less&#xD;
      than 15cm from anal verge on imaging and/or sigmoidoscopy / colonoscopy, steroid dependence,&#xD;
      inability to consent or answer SRS questions due to cognitive impairment or language barrier,&#xD;
      ASA &gt;= 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reduction in postoperative morphine use forms the primary outcome of this study. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include postoperative pain, fatigue, intraoperative heat loss and postoperative&#xD;
      inflammatory response as measured by plasma and peritoneal pro-inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      concentration. Other outcomes that will be measured include nausea and vomiting, antiemetic&#xD;
      use, and return of bowel function; with a reduction in these variables contributing to an&#xD;
      endpoint of earlier return to normal activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphine equivalent analgesia usage will be documented in PACU, day of operation, day 1, day&#xD;
      2, and day 3. Visual analog scale measures of pain at rest will be obtained preoperatively,&#xD;
      then at 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours, and days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60 postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative temperature will be measured at 15min intervals using an naso-pharyngeal&#xD;
      probe. A drain will be placed in the peritoneal cavity at the conclusion of surgery. On the&#xD;
      morning following the operation, fluid from this drain as well as a simultaneous sample of&#xD;
      blood will be collected, centrifuged and stored. Antioxidant levels will measures, and&#xD;
      cytokine assays will be carried out by multiplexed cytometric bead immunoassays using the&#xD;
      LINCOplex system (LINCO Research, St Charles, MO, USA). Drain fluid will be assayed for&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1a, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 concentrations. Data will be&#xD;
      acquired using a Luminex cytofluorimeter and analyzed using Luminex 100 IS software version&#xD;
      2.3 running a 4-parameter curve fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SRS score will be used to measure surgical recovery, and will be administered&#xD;
      preoperatively and also at days 1, 3, 7, 30, and 60. Anti-emetic use as well as time of&#xD;
      return of normal bowel function (ability to eat and drink one complete hospital meal,&#xD;
      passages of flatus or bowel motion and absence of nausea and vomiting) will also be recorded.&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted on discharge to ascertain time to return of normal preoperative&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
