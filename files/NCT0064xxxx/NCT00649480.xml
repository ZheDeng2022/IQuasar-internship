      The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Mylan balsalazide&#xD;
      disodium 750 mg capsules to Salix Colazal® 750 mg capsules following a single, oral 2250 mg&#xD;
      (3 x 750 mg) dose administration under fed conditions.&#xD;

      This open-label, single dose, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, crossover&#xD;
      study was conducted to investigate the bioequivalence of two formulations of balsalazide&#xD;
      disodium 750 mg capsules under non-fasting conditions. The study was conducted with 60 (60&#xD;
      completing) healthy adults in accordance with Protocol No. BALS-06128 (Version 22 December&#xD;
      2006). In each study period, a single, oral 2250 mg dose (3 x 750 mg capsules) was&#xD;
      administered to all subjects following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The test&#xD;
      formulation was Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Balsalazide Disodium Capsules, 750 mg and the&#xD;
      reference formulation was Colazal® 750 mg capsules (manufactured for Salix Pharmaceuticals,&#xD;
      Inc.). The subjects received the test product in one study period and the reference product&#xD;
      in the other study period. Drug administration occurred according to the dosing randomization&#xD;
      schedule (see Appendix 16.1.7). There was a 7-day washout interval between treatments.&#xD;
