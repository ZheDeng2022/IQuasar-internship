  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence, with respect to&#xD;
      risperidone and its active moiety, of a single oral dose of risperidone given as a 4 mg&#xD;
      orally-disintegrating tablet and as a 4 mg conventional RISPERDAL tablet. In addition, their&#xD;
      tolerability and safety will be documented.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open, randomized, 2-way crossover bioequivalence study in 40&#xD;
      subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The study will consist of 2&#xD;
      treatment periods, 5 days per period. The subjects will receive a single 4 mg RISPERDAL&#xD;
      conventional tablet in period 1 and a single 4 mg orally-disintegrating tablet in period 2;&#xD;
      or the orally disintegrating tablet in period 1 and conventional tablet in period 2. A&#xD;
      washout period of at least 10 days between Day 1 of Period 1 and Day 1 of Period 2 will&#xD;
      separate the 2 treatments. In both treatment periods plasma concentrations of the drug will&#xD;
      be measured. Serial blood collections will be made beginning at 0 hour (immediately before&#xD;
      study drug administration) and continuing up to 96 hours after study drug administration in&#xD;
      each period. Safety will be evaluated throughout the study using physical examinations,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram recordings (ECG), clinical laboratory testing (hematology, serum chemistry,&#xD;
      urinalysis), vital signs measurements, pregnancy testing, drug screening, and monitoring of&#xD;
      adverse events. The study will be approximately 6 weeks long (including the screening&#xD;
      period). Subjects will enter the study facility 3 days before the first administration of&#xD;
      study medication on Day 1 of the first period. They will remain at the facility until all&#xD;
      study-related procedures are completed on Day 5 of the second study period, a period of&#xD;
      approximately 18 days. 4 mg risperidone (either conventional tablet or orally-disintegrating&#xD;
      tablet), single dose, oral intake&#xD;
