    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if combining busulfan with clofarabine&#xD;
      and fludarabine can help control the disease better than the previous standard method (using&#xD;
      busulfan and fludarabine alone) in patients with AML or MDS. The safety of this combination&#xD;
      therapy will also be studied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Busulfan is designed to kill cancer cells by binding to DNA (the genetic material of cells),&#xD;
      which may cause cancer cells to die. Busulfan is commonly used in stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clofarabine is designed to interfere with the growth and development of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludarabine is designed to interfere with the DNA of cancer cells, which may cause the cancer&#xD;
      cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will receive busulfan, fludarabine, and clofarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will receive busulfan and fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have a stem cell transplant. The stem cells will be given by vein. The cells&#xD;
      will travel to your bone marrow where they are designed to make healthy, new blood cells&#xD;
      after several weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a stem cell transplant, the days before you receive your stem cells are called minus&#xD;
      days. The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0. The days after you receive the stem&#xD;
      cells are called plus days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive a &quot;test&quot; dose of busulfan by vein over about 45 minutes to 1 hour.&#xD;
      This low-level test dose of busulfan is to check how fast busulfan is processed by your body&#xD;
      and cleared from your blood. This information will determine the amount of busulfan you will&#xD;
      receive. You may receive the busulfan test dose as an outpatient during the week before you&#xD;
      are admitted to the hospital or as an inpatient 8 days before your stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 11 samples of blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points&#xD;
      and will also help determine your dose of busulfan. These blood samples will be drawn at&#xD;
      various times before you receive busulfan and over the next 11 hours. These blood draws will&#xD;
      be repeated again on the first day of high-dose busulfan treatment (Day -6, which is 6 days&#xD;
      before the transplant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A heparin lock line will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed&#xD;
      for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for technical or&#xD;
      scheduling reasons, you will receive the standard fixed dose of busulfan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days -6 through -3, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour, then clofarabine (if&#xD;
      you are in Group 1) by vein over 1 hour, then busulfan by vein over 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the transplant, you will receive tacrolimus, methotrexate, or other immunosuppressive&#xD;
      (lowering the immune system) drugs in the standard manner to lower the risk of graft-vs-host&#xD;
      disease (GvHD), a reaction of the donor's immune cells against the recipient's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are going to be receiving a transplant from an HLA-nonidentical or unrelated donor,&#xD;
      you will also receive antithymocyte globulin (ATG) by vein over 4 hours on the 3 days before&#xD;
      the transplant. This drug is designed to further weaken your immune system to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of rejecting of the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day, starting 1 week&#xD;
      after the transplant, until your blood cell levels return to normal. Filgrastim is designed&#xD;
      to help with the growth of white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While you are in the hospital, you will be checked for any side effects as part of your&#xD;
      standard of care. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn every day to check for side&#xD;
      effects, for routine tests, to check your blood counts, kidney and liver function, and to&#xD;
      check for infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of standard care, you will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after&#xD;
      transplant. After you are released from the hospital, you must remain in the Houston area to&#xD;
      be monitored for infections and other transplant side effects until about 3 months after&#xD;
      transplant. During this time, you will return to the clinic at least 1 time each week. The&#xD;
      following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be&#xD;
           having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 14-30 days after the transplant (when the transplant &quot;engrafts&quot;, or &quot;takes&quot;), you will&#xD;
      have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around Day 30, and about 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be&#xD;
           having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to see how well the transplant has taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. To collect a&#xD;
           bone marrow aspiration, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and&#xD;
           a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off study 5 years after the end of treatment. You may be taken off study&#xD;
      early if the disease gets worse, if you have any intolerable side effects, of if you are&#xD;
      unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should talk to the study doctor if you want to leave the study early. If you are taken&#xD;
      off study early, you still may need to return for routine post-transplant follow-up visits,&#xD;
      if your transplant doctor decides it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have begun to receive the study drugs&#xD;
      but before you receive the stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Busulfan and fludarabine are both FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of AML and MDS. Clofarabine is FDA approved for&#xD;
      treating other types of cancer, but is being used in AML and MDS for research only. The use&#xD;
      of these study drugs together at the dose level used in this study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 250 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
