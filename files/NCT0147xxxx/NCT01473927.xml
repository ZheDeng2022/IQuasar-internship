      Background Determining disease activity in IBD is sometimes difficult and, to be accurate,&#xD;
      requires endoscopy. The serum marker CRP has not proven sufficiently valuable as a marker for&#xD;
      IBD specific inflammation. As an alternative, so far fecal calprotectin appears to be more&#xD;
      reliable and has shown a certain value as predictive marker. Our preliminary data now show,&#xD;
      that the serum concentrations of ficolin-2 are significantly higher in CD patients with a HBI&#xD;
      &gt;3. Ficolin-2 is a lectin and acute phase protein produced in the liver and, like MBL, can&#xD;
      activate the lectin pathway of complement. Unlike MBL, deficiency for ficolin-2 was not&#xD;
      detected in our patient cohort, nor could we find functional deficiencies for ficolin-2&#xD;
      (paper submitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims The study is aimed to substantiate the data from our pilot study which shows that&#xD;
      ficolin-2 is significantly increased in CD patients during inflammation. Therefore, the study&#xD;
      will measure ficolin-2 concentrations in a sufficiently large patient group to obtain enough&#xD;
      statistical power and to compare these results with the endoscopic disease score (SES-CD) and&#xD;
      CRP and calprotectin values. Statistical analysis of the data will show us if ficolin-2 is a&#xD;
      reliable and easy to obtain new marker for active inflammation in CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Based on a power analysis 112 CD patients and 112 UC patients need to be&#xD;
      analyzed. They will be recruited from Bern, Basel and Lausanne. Only patients with routine&#xD;
      endoscopy will be included in the study and will be scored by SES-CD. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected at the day of endoscopy. Stool sample will be collected within the same week of&#xD;
      endoscopy. Calprotectin and CRP concentrations will be determined by routine diagnostics,&#xD;
      ficolin-2 concentrations will be determined by ELISA in our laboratory. Finally, all data&#xD;
      will be statistically analyzed.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Like mannan-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins are important soluble receptors for&#xD;
      microbial associated molecular patterns leading to the activation of the lectin pathway&#xD;
      complement. Ficolins are structurally related to MBL, but due to their different carbohydrate&#xD;
      recognition domain represent an own family of lectins (1). The single polypeptide chains of&#xD;
      ficolins form trimers and the trimers finally form higher order structures (tetramers up to&#xD;
      hexamers) which constitute the functional protein. Humans have three ficolins: Ficolin-1&#xD;
      (M-ficolin), -2 (L-ficolin) and -3 (H-ficolin), whereas ficolin-2 and -3 are present in the&#xD;
      serum, ficolin-1 is found on the surface of monocytes. Both, ficolin-2 and -3 are produced in&#xD;
      the liver with an additional source for ficolin-3 in the lung. Like MBL, ficolins have to&#xD;
      assemble with the MBL-associated serin proteases (MASPs) in order to activate the complement&#xD;
      pathway (1). In our study on a possible role for the influence of the complement system in&#xD;
      the development of CD-associated anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCAs), we noticed&#xD;
      that chronic inflammatory bowel disease (CIBD) patients, specifically Crohn's disease (CD)&#xD;
      patients, exhibited high serum ficolin 2 concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research group is interested in the interaction of the innate immune system with&#xD;
      microorganisms of the intestinal flora, focusing on possible defects in innate immune&#xD;
      mechanisms. We have more than ten years experience in the field, with a special focus on ASCA&#xD;
      and MBL. We have been able to continuously publish our work about these theories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our earlier and present studies on the role of MBL and the lectin pathway of complement in CD&#xD;
      led to the finding of increased ficolin-2 concentration in the sera of CD patients. Moreover,&#xD;
      we found that CD patients with a Harvey-Bradshaw index &gt;3 had significantly higher ficolin 2&#xD;
      concentrations than those with a Harvey-Bradshaw index of ≤ 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses are to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ficolin 2 concentration is higher in Crohn's patients with active disease than in CD&#xD;
           patients in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ficolin 2 correlates with endoscopic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ficolin 2 correlates with calprotectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from the first part of the study are to be confirmed in a prospective and more&#xD;
      detailed study with a larger patient cohort, testing our (new) working hypothesis that&#xD;
      ficolin 2 represents a serum marker for disease activity in CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it is currently difficult to reliably determine disease activity in CD patients using&#xD;
      serum and stool markers without simultaneous endoscopic examination, another specific and&#xD;
      easy to obtain disease marker which correlates well with disease activity would be highly&#xD;
      welcome. Particularly because the current standard marker, to monitor disease activity&#xD;
      (faecal calprotectin), is much less accepted than testing for parameters in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the study aims at answering the question of whether ficolin 2 is present in&#xD;
      greater concentrations in the blood of Crohn's patients with active inflammation compared to&#xD;
      CD patients in remission or to ulcerative colitis (UC) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of the study, the endoscopic activity index will be recorded using the&#xD;
      SES-CD (simplified endoscopic score for CD) for Crohn's patients and the Mayo score for&#xD;
      colitis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 5 ml blood will be taken to prepare serum. (5.5 ml or 4.9 ml S Monovette or 4.7&#xD;
      ml or 4.9 ml serum gel Monovette).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second test tube of blood will be taken for CRP determination. In order to measure&#xD;
      calprotectin, the patient will be asked to provide a stool sample shortly before or shortly&#xD;
      after the endoscopic examination (within one week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum ficolin values are measured by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) in the&#xD;
      laboratory at the Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern; all other values are&#xD;
      determined in routine diagnostic laboratories.&#xD;
