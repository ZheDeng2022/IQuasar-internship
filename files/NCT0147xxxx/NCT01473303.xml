      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      ganitumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing&#xD;
      substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving more than one drug (combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy) is more effective with or without ganitumab in treating patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the best dose of combination chemotherapy and&#xD;
      ganitumab and how well combination chemotherapy with or without ganitumab works in treating&#xD;
      patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of modified&#xD;
           FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) and ganitumab in patients with previously untreated, metastatic&#xD;
           pancreatic adenocarcinoma. (phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare overall survival of patients with previously untreated, metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma who receive mFOLFIRINOX plus ganitumab versus mFOLFIRINOX plus placebo.&#xD;
           (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the convergent validity of each selected PRO-CTCAE item by comparing each item&#xD;
           at baseline between patients with ECOG performance status (PS) 0 vs 1. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare objective response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival&#xD;
           of patients with previously untreated, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who receive&#xD;
           mFOLFIRINOX plus ganitumab versus mFOLFIRINOX plus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare treatment-related toxicity in patients with previously untreated, metastatic&#xD;
           pancreatic adenocarcinoma who receive mFOLFIRINOX plus ganitumab versus mFOLFIRINOX plus&#xD;
           placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the responsiveness (sensitivity to change) of Patient-Reported Outcomes&#xD;
           (PRO)-CTCAE by comparing change scores within groups of patients as defined by changes&#xD;
           in ECOG PS at post-baseline administrations. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the maximum post-baseline score for each PRO-CTCAE item per patient between&#xD;
           arms in the randomized phase II component of the study. (exploratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, phase IB study followed by a randomized phase II study.&#xD;
      Patients in the phase II study are stratified according to ECOG performance status of 0&#xD;
      versus 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase IB: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over&#xD;
           90 minutes, and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 48&#xD;
           hours beginning on day 2 (mFOLFIRINOX). After cohort 0, subsequent patients also receive&#xD;
           ganitumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of&#xD;
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I: Patients receive mFOLFIRINOX as in Phase IB and ganitumab IV over 30-60&#xD;
                minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II: Patients receive mFOLFIRINOX as in Phase IB and placebo IV over 30-60&#xD;
                minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized in the phase II component of the study may complete 16 Patient-Reported&#xD;
      Outcomes (PRO)-CTCAE items (measuring 8 symptoms) on paper on day 1 of all odd-numbered&#xD;
      courses (i.e., courses 1, 3, 5, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue and blood samples may be collected for correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.&#xD;
