      This international multicenter, randomized, open trial will evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), instituted early after the diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) not evolving favorably after 3-6 hours under optimal&#xD;
      ventilatory management and maximum medical treatment, on the morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      associated with this disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is generally a severe pulmonary&#xD;
      disease, whose associated mortality remains high. The most severe forms of ARDS, during which&#xD;
      the hypoxemia induced by the lung involvement is the most profound, have an even more dismal&#xD;
      prognosis, with a mortality rate exceeding 60%, despite resorting to exceptional adjunctive&#xD;
      therapies, like NO inhalation, prone positioning of the patients, almitrine infusion or high&#xD;
      frequency oscillation (HFO)-type ventilation. In these situations, certain teams propose&#xD;
      establishing an extracorporeal circuit, combining a centrifuge pump and an oxygenator&#xD;
      membrane, to assure total pulmonary assistance (oxygenation and CO2 removal from the blood),&#xD;
      or Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). The aim of ECMO is to minimize the trauma&#xD;
      induced by mechanical ventilation and to allow the lungs to rest. Unfortunately, trials&#xD;
      evaluating ECMO for this indication over the past few decades were failures because of the&#xD;
      interval between the onset of the disease and the installation of assistance, the poor&#xD;
      oxygenation and CO2-removal capacities of the devices used, and the high rate of&#xD;
      complications linked to the apparatus (massive hemorrhages resulting from intense&#xD;
      anticoagulation and the poor 'biocompatibility' of the circuits). However, over the past few&#xD;
      years, decisive progress has been made in the conception and construction of ECMO circuits,&#xD;
      rendering them more 'biocompatible', better performing and more resistant. Finally, the&#xD;
      results of the therapeutic trial (CESAR, UK) that used the latest generation ECMO are&#xD;
      promising. Thus, the investigators now have strong clinical and pathophysiological rationales&#xD;
      to evaluate, through a clinical trial with sufficient statistical power, the impact of early&#xD;
      ECMO installation for the most severe forms of ARDS. This project integrates into a network&#xD;
      (REVA or Network for Mechanical Ventilation) program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: ECMO, instituted early after the diagnosis of ARDS not evolving favorably&#xD;
      after 3-6 hours under optimal ventilatory management and maximum medical treatment, would&#xD;
      lower the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A multicenter, randomized, open trial. Twenty-three centers will participate in this&#xD;
      project to be conducted within the REVA network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental treatment arm: ECMO will be initiated as rapidly as possible by venovenous&#xD;
      access. The material to be used consists of pre-heparinized cannulae and tubing, a centrifuge&#xD;
      pump and a heparinized membrane oxygenator (Quadrox®, Jostra®, Maquet®). To minimize the&#xD;
      trauma induced by mechanical ventilation, the following ventilator settings will be used:&#xD;
      volume-assist control mode, FiO2 30-60%, PEEP ≥ 10 cm H2O, VT lowered to obtain a plateau&#xD;
      pressure &lt; 25 cm H2O, respiration rate (RR) 10-30/minute or APRV mode with high pressure&#xD;
      level &lt; 25 cm H2O and low pressure level ≥10 cm H2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm treatment: Standard management of ARDS, according to the modalities applied by&#xD;
      the 'maximal pulmonary recruitment' group in the EXPRESS trial (1): assist-controlled&#xD;
      ventilatory mode, VT set at 6 ml/kg of ideal body weight and PEEP set so as not to exceed a&#xD;
      plateau pressure of 28-30 cm H2O. In the case of refractory hypoxemia, the usual adjunctive&#xD;
      therapeutics can be used: NO, prone position, HFO ventilation, almitrine infusion. A&#xD;
      cross-over option to ECMO will be possible in the case of refractory hypoxemia defined as&#xD;
      blood arterial saturation SaO2 &lt; 80% for &gt; 6 hours, despite mandatory use of recruitment&#xD;
      maneuvers, and inhaled NO/prostacyclin and if technically possible a test of prone position,&#xD;
      and only if the patient has no irreversible multiple organ failure and if the physician in&#xD;
      charge of the patient believes that this could actually change the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and judgement criteria: The primary endpoint is to achieve, with ECMO,&#xD;
      significantly lower mortality on day (D) 60 (D1 is the day of randomization). Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to show: a benefit in terms of lower ICU and hospital mortality rates at D30&#xD;
      and D90; lower pneumothorax frequency; shortened duration of mechanical ventilation; less&#xD;
      need for hemodynamic support with catecholamines; shorter ICU and hospital stays; and more&#xD;
      days, between inclusion and D60, without mechanical ventilation, without organ failure and&#xD;
      without hemodynamic support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: The high mortality rate of severe ARDS (≥ 60%) justifies combining all&#xD;
      efforts to reach a rapid conclusion and thus resorting to a sequential analytical plan, with&#xD;
      stopping rules based on the triangular test. Thus, with 80% power and a 5% α-risk for the&#xD;
      hypothesis of ECMO achieving a 20% absolute mortality reduction, the characteristics of the&#xD;
      study, calculated with a triangle test, are the following: a maximum of 331 subjects to be&#xD;
      included and a 90% probability of stopping the study before 220 subjects have been included.&#xD;
