      Purpose: This study is to determine the effect of T89(Dantonic®)on P450 enzymes. This study&#xD;
      will help determine which types of drugs may interact with T89.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      T89 is a modernized and industrialized version of a traditional Chinese herbal medicine. T89&#xD;
      was approved for marketing as a drug, for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris due&#xD;
      to coronary heart disease, by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of China in 1993.&#xD;
      There were more than 2 billion doses have been prescribed or used, in about 10,000,000&#xD;
      subjects, in short or long-term administration worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product is also marketed, as a drug, in Russia, South Korea, Mongolia, Singapore,&#xD;
      Vietnam, and South Africa. The current study is to determine the anti-angina effect and dose&#xD;
      response of T89 in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T89 consists of Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae, RSM) and Sanqi (Radix Notoginseng, RN)&#xD;
      as active constitutes, and using Borneol as transporting enhancer.&#xD;
