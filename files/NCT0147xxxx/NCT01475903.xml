      Bariatric surgery is now recognized as a procedure of choice for the treatment of morbid&#xD;
      obesity, resulting in long-term effectiveness on weight loss and comorbidities. The two types&#xD;
      of procedures, most often performed in Europe, are adjustable gastric banding (AGB), a purely&#xD;
      restrictive reversible procedure, and gastric bypass (GBP), an irreversible procedure, which&#xD;
      associates restriction and mild malabsorption. Longitudinal sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is&#xD;
      another bariatric procedure which tends to develop quickly. More recent, this technique is&#xD;
      recognized in France by the High Authority of Health since 2008, consisting of fundus and&#xD;
      greater curvature resection, removing 75 % the gastric volume, leaving a narrow gastric tube&#xD;
      or &quot;sleeve&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although malabsorption does not occur in most bariatric procedures, micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies are possible. GBP is known to induce nutritional and vitamin deficiencies&#xD;
      concerning iron, calcium, vitamins B12, B9, D and proteins. Restrictive procedures have minor&#xD;
      effects on normal physiological digestive processes but could lead to vitamin deficiency&#xD;
      secondary to decreased nutrient intake and a tendency towards avoidance of certain types of&#xD;
      food due to intolerance. Studies of nutritional complications of bariatric surgery concern&#xD;
      essentially AGB, GBP and vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) which is no longer performed in&#xD;
      France. The nutritional impact of LSG remains to be evaluated. To date, data concerning&#xD;
      evaluation of nutritional status from patients who underwent LSG are almost non-existent.&#xD;

&#xD;
      In view of the increasing popularity of this surgical technique, assessment of the&#xD;
      nutritional consequences of longitudinal sleeve gastrectomy seems to be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess during a 2-year prospective follow-up, the&#xD;
      prevalence of nutrient deficiencies in patients undergoing a longitudinal sleeve gastrectomy&#xD;
      for morbid obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity, defined by a body mass index (BMI) higher than 30 kg/m2, is a chronic metabolic&#xD;
      disease the prevalence of which reaches epidemic proportions. Obesity increases the risk of&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, all risk factors for the leading cause of death&#xD;
      worldwide-cardiovascular disease. Moreover, obesity can lead to obstructive sleep apnea,&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cancer, etcâ€¦(Fried 2007). It represents&#xD;
      one of society's major public health problems in (WHO 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of obesity is primarily a medical matter. A multidisciplinary approach is&#xD;
      recommended with nutritional, dietary and psychological follow-up. It requires a modification&#xD;
      of life-style and long-term support. However, the long-term results of conventional medical&#xD;
      therapy are disappointing, especially for morbid obesity. Bariatric surgery is now recognized&#xD;
      as a procedure of choice for the treatment of morbid obesity. It's role in the therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy is justified by long-term effectiveness on weight loss and comorbidities associated&#xD;
      with high body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two types of bariatric procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Restrictive procedures, consisting of a reduction of the stomach volume : vertical&#xD;
           banded gastroplasty (VBG), adjustable gastric banding (AGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  And combined procedures (restrictive and malabsorptive) : gastric by-pass and&#xD;
           biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) with or without duodenal switch (DS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two types of procedures most often performed in Europe are AGB et GBP (Coupe 2009). VBG&#xD;
      is tending to disappear in France, and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), with or without&#xD;
      duodenal switch (DS) is a complex procedure that is reserved for only very specific&#xD;
      situations (Ziegler 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleeve gastrectomy is a relatively new bariatric procedure. It was initially introduced as&#xD;
      either the restrictive component of BPD-DS or the first step of a staged approach for weight&#xD;
      loss. In the latter, super-obese patients with increased operative risks undergo SG to&#xD;
      initiate enough weight loss to allow for a second stage gastric bypass or BPD-DS. It has been&#xD;
      recently used as a definitive bariatric surgery procedure following reports of significant&#xD;
      reduction in BMI and comorbidities. It is recognized in France by the High Authority of&#xD;
      Health since 2008. SG is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure, in which the fundus and the&#xD;
      greater curvature of the stomach are removed, leaving a narrow gastric tube or &quot;sleeve&quot;&#xD;
      (Hakea 2009). Because of this partial gastrectomy, SG also affects ghrelin secretion which is&#xD;
      an orexigenic hormone. These changes in the concentration of gut peptides induce a loss of&#xD;
      appetite. The acceleration of the gastric emptying could also participate in weight loss&#xD;
      (Ankar 2008). The advantages of sleeve gastrectomy reside in a lower rate of complications&#xD;
      compared with BPG due in particular to the absence of implanted devices, the conservation of&#xD;
      digestive continuity and the absence of malabsorption (Gums 2007). In terms of weight loss,&#xD;
      the gastric by-pass appeared the most effective, followed by the sleeve gastrectomy, then the&#xD;
      adjustable gastric ring. According to a recent meta-analysis, the loss of weight expressed in&#xD;
      percentage of reduced excess weight was 61,6 % for the BPG and 47,5 % for the GB within 2&#xD;
      years of the procedure (Buchwald 2004). Concerning the sleeve gastrectomy, a review of the&#xD;
      literature comprising 15 studies and including 646 patients, shows evidence of a reduction of&#xD;
      excess weight of 49 % and 56 % after 6 months and 1 year respectively with a resolution of&#xD;
      co-morbidity such as arterial high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, from 60 to 100 % (Gums&#xD;
      : 2007). The data on long-term follow-up is less well documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of nutritional deficiencies depends on the percentage of weight loss and the type of&#xD;
      surgical procedure performed The nutritional deficits observed after gastric surgery can be&#xD;
      explained by various mechanisms according to the technique used. T BPG, which is both&#xD;
      restrictive and malabsorptive surgery, is frequently at the origin of nutritional and vitamin&#xD;
      deficiencies essentially concerning proteins, iron, calcium, vitamins B12, B9 and D. In&#xD;
      contrast, in the absence of malabsorption, the nutritional deficits induced by AGB are less&#xD;
      pronounced and particularly linked to contribution deficiencies due to vomiting, food&#xD;
      aversions and modification of food supply .Studies evaluating the nutritional status of&#xD;
      patients before and after surgery are scarce and prevalency of the reported deficits varies&#xD;
      greatly according to the population studied, the type of surgery used, the systematic&#xD;
      prescription or not of vitamin complements, and the duration of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most frequent deficit is the deficiency in vitamin B12, found in 1/3 of the one year&#xD;
      follow up BPG patients (Malone 2008). Folate deficiency (vitamin B9) is also frequent,&#xD;
      arising in 20 % of cases (Pournaras 2009). Both are at the origin of macrocytic anaemia,&#xD;
      leucopenia, thrombopenia and glossitis. Sometimes irreversible neurological affections can&#xD;
      also arise in the case of B12 deficiency. The effects of bariatric surgery on vitamin D and&#xD;
      calcium are rarely specified in the long term, but it is important to note that it is not&#xD;
      rare to observe vitamin D deficiencies pre-existent to surgery affecting between 21 and 57 %&#xD;
      of obese subjects according to certain studies, (Toh 2009, Hamoui 2004), responsible for an&#xD;
      increase in osseous fragility and secondary hyper-parathyroidism. The patients most at risk&#xD;
      of osteomalacia would be the ones whose BMI is over 50, menopause women, patients having&#xD;
      undergone a massive loss of weight after surgery and patients deficient in vitamin D prior to&#xD;
      surgery (Malone 2008). Bariatric sideropenic anaemia is also frequent after surgery whether&#xD;
      restrictive or malabsorptive, affecting 5 to 10 % of the subjects in most of the studies and&#xD;
      as many as 74 % according to one study (Sadoul 2007). It is linked to contribution deficiency&#xD;
      due to decreased consumption of meat, in the case of malabsorption (BPG) but also due to lack&#xD;
      of production of gastric hydrochloric acid which allows the conversion of the ferrous iron&#xD;
      foodstuffs to ferric iron, which is the absorbable form. Other vitamin deficiencies were&#xD;
      reported, in particular the deficit in vitamin B1 (or thiamine) , essentially due to vomiting&#xD;
      because of the gastric limitation, and which can be revealed by an intravenous drip of&#xD;
      thiamine-free glucose. Vitamin B1 deficiency, although rather rare, is potentially serious&#xD;
      because of neurological damage such as the sometimes irreversible Gayet-Wernicke's syndrome,&#xD;
      (Poitou 2008; Morel 2008). Deficits in liposoluble vitamins A, E and K are exceptional except&#xD;
      in the case of serious malabsorption induced by bilic-pancreatic diversion and duodenal&#xD;
      switch. Zinc, magnesium and selenium deficiencies are also described but remain rare and&#xD;
      originate mostly through exoskeleton or cutaneous disorders but cases of cardiomyopathy by&#xD;
      selenium deficiency was also reported .&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, recommendations on the optimal vitamin supplementation to be prescribed according to&#xD;
      the method of surgery used are not clearly defined. According to recent recommendations of&#xD;
      the HAS for the surgical care of adult obesity, &quot; the medical and surgical follow-up must&#xD;
      emphasize the prevention of, and the detection of, vitamin or nutritional deficiency&#xD;
      including the identification of clinical (in particular neurological) and biological symptoms&#xD;
      of undernutrition or vitamin deficiency. A systematic multivitamin supplementation must be&#xD;
      established after malabsorptive surgery (multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium, iron and vitamin&#xD;
      B12). &quot; However, certain authors report deficiencies in spite of systematic prescription of&#xD;
      multivitamin supplements after by-pass surgery .Data on the prescribed doses, controls, or&#xD;
      even the preliminary nutritional state before surgery remains badly specified. On one hand,&#xD;
      the rarity of prospective studies evaluating these parameters explains the difficulty in&#xD;
      estimating these nutritional complications. On the other hand, the various studies listed&#xD;
      refer essentially to gastric by-pass, the adjustable gastric ring, and the calibrated&#xD;
      vertical gastroplasty which is tending to disappear. The impact of the sleeve gastrectomy on&#xD;
      the nutritional state of the patients remains to be specified. To date, data concerning the&#xD;
      vitamin and nutritional evaluation of patients operated by sleeve gastrectomy is almost&#xD;
      non-existent. A recent review of the literature did not reveal any nutritional&#xD;
      recommendations specifically for sleeve gastrectomy mostly due to the very small number of&#xD;
      studies available. An American team studied the evolution of the nutritional assessment in&#xD;
      the case of sleeve gastrectomy but the parameters studied were limited to albumin,&#xD;
      haemoglobin and calcium. A decrease of the haemoglobinaemia was objectivized to 5 of 36&#xD;
      patients followed during 1 year .An Australian team also retrospectively estimated prevalency&#xD;
      of nutritional deficiencies after bariatric surgery, but the data concerning sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy is not significant considering the large number of patients lost sight of in 1&#xD;
      year (&gt; 80 %) (Toh 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growing interest in LSG as a surgical procedure for managing morbid obesity requires&#xD;
      further investigation of it's metabolic consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the increasing popularity of this surgical technique the evaluation of the&#xD;
      nutritional repercussions of sleeve gastrectomy appears indispensable. If the investigators&#xD;
      consider the surgical aspect of this procedure, the investigators would expect to observe a&#xD;
      deficiency in vitamin B12 and iron. Indeed, defined as a purely restrictive procedure, the&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy consists of the resection of the gastric fundus, the seat of production of&#xD;
      the intrinsic factor, itself necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Moreover, the&#xD;
      decrease in production of hydrochloric acid and the potential vomiting caused by the vast&#xD;
      gastric resection can potentially have an effect on the absorption of iron. The study&#xD;
      proposed here aims to make a prospective follow-up of the nutritional and vitamin assessment&#xD;
      of obese patients operated by sleeve gastrectomy at the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Clermont-Ferrand. Every patient will receive a clinical and biological assessment including&#xD;
      the dosages of vitamins and trace elements prior to surgery then after 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
      months. The effect of sleeve gastrectomy on the nutritional status of the operated patients&#xD;
      will thus be evaluated with a view to answering the question: Is sleeve gastrectomy a purely&#xD;
      restrictive surgical technique ?&#xD;
