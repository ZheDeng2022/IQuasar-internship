    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to develop and test the effectiveness of culturally&#xD;
      appropriate asthma videos and other educational materials based on knowledge from this study&#xD;
      and the investigators' previous studies. By culturally appropriate materials the&#xD;
      investigators mean to develop health information (in the format of video and written&#xD;
      materials) in the community own language and applied the most appealing cultural beliefs and&#xD;
      practices in the Chinese and Punjabi communities. The investigators also aim to recommend a&#xD;
      practical framework and to develop a measure of asthma knowledge and health literacy among&#xD;
      immigrants from the Punjabi and Chinese communities in BC. The investigators' definition of&#xD;
      health literacy in this study is the capability of a person to navigate and access to&#xD;
      asthma-related information, as well as to understand, evaluate, and communicate the obtained&#xD;
      information to improve his/her health status. The investigators' hypothesis is that&#xD;
      audio-visual based asthma information in a subject's native language would improve a&#xD;
      patient's knowledge and self-management of asthma in comparison to printed information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is compelling evidence indicating that newcomers to Canada with limited English&#xD;
      proficiency and low health literacy are facing systemic, linguistic and cultural barriers in&#xD;
      accessing health information and treatment services pertaining to Asthma. The intent of this&#xD;
      study is to develop and test the effectiveness of culturally appropriate asthma videos and&#xD;
      other educational materials based on knowledge from this study and the investigators'&#xD;
      previous elicitation studies, to recommend a practical framework and to develop a measure of&#xD;
      asthma knowledge and health literacy among immigrants from the Punjabi and Chinese&#xD;
      communities in the Greater Vancouver Area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the proposed research are: &quot;1.&quot; to assess the knowledge, attitudes,&#xD;
      beliefs, and practices related to asthma and relevant issues in selected individuals within&#xD;
      the target communities; &quot;2.&quot; to investigate access and utilization patterns of asthma-related&#xD;
      services among participant communities; &quot;3.&quot; to assess the effectiveness of culturally&#xD;
      competent and participatory developed videos and written educational materials on&#xD;
      individuals' knowledge and health literacy skills related to asthma; &quot;4.&quot; to examine&#xD;
      relationships between health literacy, culture, language and access to and utilization of&#xD;
      asthma services among targeted newcomer individuals; &quot;5.&quot; to build research capacity and&#xD;
      community-university-service provider alliances, and contribute to the development of an&#xD;
      integrated research-service agenda on newcomers' asthma self-management among target&#xD;
      communities; and &quot;6.&quot; to disseminate information to decision makers and knowledge-users , so&#xD;
      the results of this study can be efficiently used in developing relevant services that meet&#xD;
      newcomers' needs. The proposed research will use quantitative and qualitative methods&#xD;
      including a full participatory approach that builds on the investigators' previous work with&#xD;
      vulnerable ethno-cultural communities in BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of the project will include the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;1.&quot; Conduct environmental scan and needs assessment study (literature review and&#xD;
      interviews); &quot;2&quot; Develop video clips, written materials, and relevant measurement tools; &quot;3&quot;&#xD;
      Apply the video clips and written materials to test their effectiveness among individuals&#xD;
      from the target communities in terms of asthma self-management; &quot;4&quot; Conduct quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative data analysis; and &quot;5&quot; Disseminate the findings to larger audiences,&#xD;
      key-informants, knowledge users and policy makers across BC. This research will make&#xD;
      theoretical, methodological and applied research contributions. It will establish strong&#xD;
      community - academic connections for the development of the proposed framework. Community&#xD;
      participation will be applied throughout the development of this study and educational&#xD;
      materials, enhancing the potential of acquiring new knowledge about cultural and traditional&#xD;
      practices of the sample population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' approach will allow health care workers and policy makers to design&#xD;
      appropriate health promotion initiatives targeted to diverse newcomer groups in relation to&#xD;
      asthma. The investigators foresee findings that provide not only better ways to measure&#xD;
      health literacy pertaining to asthma in the investigators' target groups, but that will also&#xD;
      help develop materials and measures that can be applied to diverse cultural populations in BC&#xD;
      and the rest of Canada. The investigators expect that the participatory approach used in this&#xD;
      study will contribute to capacity building, improving newcomers' ability to access and use&#xD;
      relevant asthma information (in terms of prevention, control and management) and to transfer&#xD;
      and share the information learned with other members of the target communities. The proposed&#xD;
      community consultation will also help the investigators to identify culturally appropriate&#xD;
      communication mode(s) to deliver health promotion messages and determine practical adult&#xD;
      learning approaches applicable to diverse communities in Canada.&#xD;
