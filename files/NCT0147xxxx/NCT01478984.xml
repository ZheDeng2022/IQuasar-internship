    <textblock>
      Patients with NSTEMI and multivessel disease will be scheduled to undergo early invasive&#xD;
      strategy (PCI within 72 hours) of de novo native coronary artery lesions were considered for&#xD;
      recruitment into the study. Inclusion criteria are the following: diagnosis of NSTEMI&#xD;
      according to current guidelines presenting with multivessel disease. We will exclude patients&#xD;
      with cardiogenic shock at presentation (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg despite drug&#xD;
      therapy), left main coronary disease (&gt;50% diameter stenosis), previous coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, patients with Syntax Score &gt;32 and candidated to by-pass&#xD;
      surgery (10), severe valvular heart disease and unsuccessful procedures. Procedure success&#xD;
      was defined as the achievement of an angiographic residual stenosis of less than 30% and a&#xD;
      thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade III after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to One-Stage group were completely revascularizated in one time PCI,&#xD;
      whereas patients randomized to Multi-Staged group were completely revascularizated in more&#xD;
      time PCI, during the same hospitalization. Patients received a clopidogrel loading dose of&#xD;
      600 mg before the PCI (for loading dose administered more than 6 h prior to procedure).&#xD;
      Post-procedural antiplatelet regimen consisted of aspirin at 100 mg/day indefinitely and&#xD;
      clopidogrel 75 mg/day for at least one month.&#xD;
