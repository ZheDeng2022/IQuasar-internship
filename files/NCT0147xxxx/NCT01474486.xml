  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to conduct a preliminary test of the feasibility of a&#xD;
      multi-micronutrient intervention to improve micronutrient status, cardiac function and&#xD;
      quality of life in Veterans with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with stable CHF resulting from ischemic cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction and&#xD;
      an ejection fraction â‰¤45% and who fit the criteria of stage B, C and D 2 heart failure will&#xD;
      be recruited. This is a one group study with Veterans serving as their own control. They will&#xD;
      receive 50 mg thiamin, vitamin B50 and 220 mg Zn as Zn sulfate daily for 6 months.&#xD;
      Additionally, they will receive 50,000 IU Vitamin D as ergocalciferol each week for 8 weeks&#xD;
      then every other week for 16 weeks. Pre (baseline) and post (6 months) cardiac function will&#xD;
      be tested with echocardiogram and cardiac MR (when applicable), biochemical measures of&#xD;
      thiamine, pyridoxine, zinc and Vitamin D will be measured at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and&#xD;
      one year. Quality of life will be measured using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure&#xD;
      questionnaire baseline, month 3,6,and one year. Nutritional assessment including a nutrition&#xD;
      focused physical examination and three days food records will also be measured at baseline,&#xD;
      month 3, 6 and one year.&#xD;

    <description>The &quot;Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire&quot; was used to assess quality of life (QOL). This scale has 21 questions and each question has a possible score of 0 -5, where 0 is no or not applicable, 1 is very little and 5 is very much. The score for each question measures how much heart failure is affecting QOL. The higher the score the more heart failure is affecting QOL. Possible range of total scores is 0 - 105. The change from baseline QOL to quality of life at 3 months was calculated by subtracting the 3 month score from the baseline score. A lower score at 3 months indicates better QOL and a high score at 3 months indicates a worse QOL.</description>

    <measure>Nutritional Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in nutritional status at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nutritional Injury (NI) stage was used to assign nutritional status. Nutritional injury describes the interaction between agent, host and environmental factors as 6 progressive stages of altered nutritional status leading to nutritional disease. The 6 stages are seen as progressive beginning with (1) adaptation and diminishing or exceeding reserves, (2) reserves exhausted/ exceeded, (3) physiologic and metabolic alterations related to under/over nutrition, (4) non-specific signs and symptoms of under/over nutrition, (5) illness / specific signs and symptoms of under/over nutrition and (6) permanent damage/damage unresponsive to treatment. The following were used to determine overall nutritional status: body mass index, diet quality, blood nutrient levels and other biochemical measures, physical signs and symptoms of nutrient deficiencies or excesses. The lower the stage the less nutritional injury. The outcome measure is the difference in NI from baseline at 3 months.</description>

             or memory loss that prevents compliance with the supplement intake, agoraphobia which&#xD;
             may interfere attendance at research visits or fear of needles which would limit their&#xD;
             ability to have the blood tests completed, and any active eating disorders. Cardiac&#xD;
             Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan will not be used to test cardiac function in&#xD;

             subjects with ferro magnetic materials (i.e., penile stimulator), inability to lie&#xD;
             flat for up to one hour, inability to hold their breath for up to 15 seconds or those&#xD;

      <pre_assignment_details>40 participants consented to the study. Twelve were screen failures and six withdrew following consent but prior to their first visit when baseline data collection would have taken place and the intervention would have started. Therefore twenty-two participants received the intervention.&#xD;
The participants served as their own control, so there is only one arm of the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire</title>
          <description>Total score on the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. The scale is used to determine how much heart failure has affected life during the past month. There are 21 questions, each with 5 possible answers 0-5 where 0 is No or not applicable, and 1 is Very Little and 5 is Very Much. The lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 105. A low score indicates heart failure has little affect on quality of life and a high score indicates heart failure is negatively affecting quality of life.&#xD;

        <title>Change in Quality of Life</title>
        <description>The &quot;Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire&quot; was used to assess quality of life (QOL). This scale has 21 questions and each question has a possible score of 0 -5, where 0 is no or not applicable, 1 is very little and 5 is very much. The score for each question measures how much heart failure is affecting QOL. The higher the score the more heart failure is affecting QOL. Possible range of total scores is 0 - 105. The change from baseline QOL to quality of life at 3 months was calculated by subtracting the 3 month score from the baseline score. A lower score at 3 months indicates better QOL and a high score at 3 months indicates a worse QOL.</description>

        <title>Nutritional Status</title>
        <description>Nutritional Injury (NI) stage was used to assign nutritional status. Nutritional injury describes the interaction between agent, host and environmental factors as 6 progressive stages of altered nutritional status leading to nutritional disease. The 6 stages are seen as progressive beginning with (1) adaptation and diminishing or exceeding reserves, (2) reserves exhausted/ exceeded, (3) physiologic and metabolic alterations related to under/over nutrition, (4) non-specific signs and symptoms of under/over nutrition, (5) illness / specific signs and symptoms of under/over nutrition and (6) permanent damage/damage unresponsive to treatment. The following were used to determine overall nutritional status: body mass index, diet quality, blood nutrient levels and other biochemical measures, physical signs and symptoms of nutrient deficiencies or excesses. The lower the stage the less nutritional injury. The outcome measure is the difference in NI from baseline at 3 months.</description>

          <title>Nutritional Status</title>
          <description>Nutritional Injury (NI) stage was used to assign nutritional status. Nutritional injury describes the interaction between agent, host and environmental factors as 6 progressive stages of altered nutritional status leading to nutritional disease. The 6 stages are seen as progressive beginning with (1) adaptation and diminishing or exceeding reserves, (2) reserves exhausted/ exceeded, (3) physiologic and metabolic alterations related to under/over nutrition, (4) non-specific signs and symptoms of under/over nutrition, (5) illness / specific signs and symptoms of under/over nutrition and (6) permanent damage/damage unresponsive to treatment. The following were used to determine overall nutritional status: body mass index, diet quality, blood nutrient levels and other biochemical measures, physical signs and symptoms of nutrient deficiencies or excesses. The lower the stage the less nutritional injury. The outcome measure is the difference in NI from baseline at 3 months.</description>

        <description>The &quot;Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire&quot; was used to assess quality of life (QOL). This scale has 21 questions and each question has a possible score of 0 - 5, where 0 is no or not applicable, 1 is very little and 5 is very much. The score for each question measures how much heart failure is affecting QOL. The higher the score the more heart failure is affecting QOL. Possible range of total scores is 0 - 105. The change from baseline QOL to quality of life at 6 months was calculated by subtracting the 6 month score from the baseline score. A lower score at 6 months indicates better QOL and a higher score at 6 months indicates a worse QOL.</description>
