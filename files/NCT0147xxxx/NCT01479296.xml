      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response to the Vaccine Research Center&#xD;
      (VRC) rAd5 HIV vaccine when the vaccine components are administered in three different ways,&#xD;
      in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VRC rAd5 HIV vaccine contains four different components. In this study, researchers will&#xD;
      examine how the immune system responds to the vaccine when the four components are&#xD;
      administered in three different ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The vaccine dose containing all four components is given as a single injection in one&#xD;
           arm, and placebo injections are given in the other arm and both legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The vaccine dose containing all four components is divided into fourths, and one-fourth&#xD;
           of the full dose is given in each arm and leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The four vaccine components are separated, and a different component is given in each&#xD;
           arm and leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of three groups. Group 1 will receive the entire dose of vaccine in their right arm&#xD;
      and placebo vaccine in the other arm and both legs. Group 2 will receive all four different&#xD;
      components of the vaccine, given separately as a different component per each arm and leg.&#xD;
      Group 3 will receive the entire vaccine dose divided into fourths, with one fourth of the&#xD;
      full dose given in each arm and leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a baseline study visit, participants will undergo a physical examination and a medical and&#xD;
      medication history review. Female participants will also take a pregnancy test. Participants&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires and receive counseling on HIV risk reduction and pregnancy&#xD;
      prevention. All participants will then receive vaccine given as four injections-one each in&#xD;
      their right arm, left arm, right thigh, and left thigh (except for Group 1, placebo&#xD;
      injections are given in left arm and both legs). After receiving the vaccine, participants&#xD;
      will remain in the clinic for at least 30 minutes for observation and monitoring of side&#xD;
      effects. For 7 days after the vaccination, participants will record any side effects in a&#xD;
      symptom log; for the first 3 days after the vaccination, study staff will call participants&#xD;
      to ensure they are completing the symptom log. Follow-up visits will occur at Months 1, 4,&#xD;
      and 7. These visits will include the baseline study procedures and a blood collection.&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by study researchers once a year for 5 years for follow-up&#xD;
      health monitoring. Blood collected during study visits will be saved for future testing.&#xD;
