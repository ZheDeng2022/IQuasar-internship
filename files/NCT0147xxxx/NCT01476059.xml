      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      General:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the compliance degree to the treatment of asthmatic children, according to the&#xD;
      attention received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study asthmatic compliance to the treatment proposed, aiming at an association with&#xD;
           other factors, such as: parents' instruction, hospitalizations, personal and family&#xD;
           history of atopy, co-morbidities, severity of the disease and use of other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study asthmatic compliance to the treatment proposed, associating it with the impact&#xD;
           in quality of life, though the application of a specific questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome, compliance, is being measured by the number of doses used of the drug&#xD;
      salmeterol combined with fluticasone (Seretide Diskus) divided by the number of doses&#xD;
      foreseen for the time considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be considered as secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease control, evaluated by information in the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular medical attention sought, evaluated by information in the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional resources in the event of attacks, increase in the weekly number of nocturnal&#xD;
           awakening or the number of awakenings per night, increase in the use of rescue drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Casuistic and Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthmatic children aged 6 to 14 years old from both sexes, with persistent mild, moderate or&#xD;
      sever asthma classified according to the criteria from the III - Brazilian Consensus on&#xD;
      Asthma Management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I - Asthmatic children being treated, who will be given medical guidance and&#xD;
      therapeutic guidance through telephone calls at every fifteen days to the parents or&#xD;
      guardians, performed by trained professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II - Asthmatic children being treated, who will be given medical guidance without&#xD;
      telephone follow-up calls to parents or guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, controlled, randomized, parallel-group study, with the inclusion of&#xD;
      472 children presenting persistent moderate or severe asthma. Our researchers developed the&#xD;
      study, and it will be performed only in Brazil, solely by our Clinical Research Center. The&#xD;
      drug to be used is in accordance with the main International Consensus on Asthma Treatment&#xD;
      and with the III - Brazilian Consensus on Asthma Management, being marketed for some years in&#xD;
      Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During patient recruitment and screening, their parents or guardians will fill out the free&#xD;
      informed consent form. At this time, they will also be given the drug (Seretide Diskus®&#xD;
      50/250) with doses enough for a 90-day treatment, twice a day, in addition to instructions on&#xD;
      the use of the device to apply the drug and guidance from his/her physician on how to act in&#xD;
      the event of an attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study inclusion, the study will receive a number which will randomly include him/her in&#xD;
      group 1 or 2 of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in group 1 will receive two types of telephone calls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Investigation telephone call - TI: that will be made by a trained health professional from&#xD;
      the Centro de Pesquisa Clínica e Medicina Avançada, aiming at: presentation, data collection&#xD;
      on asthma, including demographics and relevant clinical history (details on asthma, previous&#xD;
      exacerbations, drugs used, etc), submission of a standardized checking questionnaire&#xD;
      (questionnaire 1 - attachment 1) and quality of life questionnaire (questionnaire 2 -&#xD;
      attachment 2). By 90 days, the patient's guardian will receive the last investigation&#xD;
      telephone call (TI -2) in order to apply the quality of life questionnaire and standardized&#xD;
      evaluation questionnaire (questionnaire 1 - attachment 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Compliance telephone call - TA: A specifically trained professional will make follow-up&#xD;
      telephone calls at every fifteen days, according to a pre-established guide (Attachment 4),&#xD;
      requesting the patient to answer the questions pursuant to the follow-up questionnaire&#xD;
      (attachment 3) and clarifying probable doubts on the drug application, however, without&#xD;
      interfering with the treatment prescribed by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in group 2 will receive only the Investigation Telephone call (TI) All&#xD;
      telephone contacts will be made for the same person: mother, father or guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the end of week 12, the persons responsible for the patients will return, by mail, the&#xD;
      drug to Centro de Pesquisa Clínica e Medicina Avançada.&#xD;
