  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of Phase 1 of this clinical research study is to test the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      AMG 479 when given with trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Phase 2 of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of AMG 479&#xD;
      and trastuzumab can help to control breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMG 479 is designed to block tumor cells from growing and spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking&#xD;
      proteins inside the cancer cell.&#xD;

      Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. Groups of 3 participants will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      Phase 1 portion of the study. There are 2 dose levels that will be tested in Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase 1 portion, the dose of AMG 479 you receive will depend on&#xD;
      when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the higher dose&#xD;
      level of AMG 479. If there are intolerable side effects, the next group will receive the&#xD;
      lower dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase 2 portion, you will receive AMG 479 at the highest dose that&#xD;
      was tolerated in the Phase 1 portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive AMG 479 by vein over 60-120 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive trastuzumab by vein over 30-90 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are already receiving trastuzumab at the time you join the study, you will continue to&#xD;
      receive the standard dose of trastuzumab. If the last dose of trastuzumab was given more than&#xD;
      1-3 weeks before you joined the study (depending on the dose previously received), then you&#xD;
      will receive a higher &quot;loading&quot; dose of trastuzumab followed by the standard dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every visit, you will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your vital signs will be checked before, during, and after each infusion of AMG 479.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Phase 1, blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) testing 2 times (before and after the study drug dose) on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2. PK&#xD;
      testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status and any updates to your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, you will have CT or MRI scans to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for blood sugar tests. You will need to fast&#xD;
           for 8 hours before these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status and any updates to your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a PET-CT scan at Week 3 if you had a PET-CT scan at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8 of Cycles 1-3, blood (about 1Â½ teaspoons) will be drawn to check your blood clotting&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months, you will have either an ECHO or MUGA scan to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In certain cases with your doctor's permission, the study visits may occur 1 day earlier or&#xD;
      later than described above. If you are having side effects, extra clinic visits may be&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after the last study drug dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects and about any drugs you may be&#xD;
           taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any updates to your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a hearing test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have not had one in the last 30 days or after your last treatment, you will have&#xD;
           an ECHO or MUGA scan to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have CT or MRI scans to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Phase 1, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for PK testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Trastuzumab is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of breast cancer. AMG-479 is not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      AMG-479 is currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 35 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
