  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical patients are high risk for post operative infections. These post operative&#xD;
      infections contribute to increased length of hospital stay, hospital costs and delay overall&#xD;
      recovery time thus decreasing the quality of life. Studies have reported post operative&#xD;
      complications ranging from 37% to 74%.1 The most costly complications include infectious&#xD;
      complications after major Gastrointestinal (GI) surgery including wound infections, abdominal&#xD;
      abscess, pneumonia, sepsis and anastomic leaks.2 Several studies have been conducted that&#xD;
      show a significant reduction in infectious complications and average length of stay when&#xD;
      treated with immunonutrition supplements.2-3 A review of similarly designed studies in a&#xD;
      different patient population indicate that post-operative infections can be reduced by an&#xD;
      average of 71% with immunonutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to investigate the effect of Impact Advanced Recovery ® in improving&#xD;
      surgical outcomes in patients receiving major gastrointestinal surgeries compared to a&#xD;
      standard supplement at James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital. Providing Impact Advanced Recovery&#xD;
      ® may decrease post-operative infectious complications, length of stay, and recovery time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients receiving elective gastrointestinal surgery (esophageal, gastric, pancreatic&#xD;
           or colon resections) there will be a significant decrease of at least 60% in&#xD;
           post-operative infections as listed below for patients who consume 15 servings of Impact&#xD;
           Advanced Recovery® pre-operatively compared to patients who consume 15 servings of a&#xD;
           standard supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Complications to be considered: anastomatic leak, post-op wound development, post-op&#xD;
           abdominal abscess, sepsis, pneumonia, post-op ileus, intestinal fistula, obstruction,&#xD;
           urinary tract infections, peritonitis or bowel necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In patients receiving elective gastrointestinal surgery (esophageal, gastric, pancreatic&#xD;
           or colon resections) there will be a significant decrease in hospital and NPO days for&#xD;
           patients who consume 15 servings of Impact Advanced Recovery ® pre-operatively.&#xD;
