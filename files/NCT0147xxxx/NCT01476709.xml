      Rationale: evaluate the potential of the photonic needle (photonic needle technology) to&#xD;
      discriminate tissues that are relevant to recognize during intraforaminal (transforaminal)&#xD;
      epidural injection on lumbar level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to investigate the potential of the&#xD;
      photonic needle to discriminate between correct and incorrect placement of the needle tip in&#xD;
      the target area of the procedure (M4 - tissue), as confirmed by contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      fluoroscopy. The secondary objectives are to investigate the differences in the optical&#xD;
      signals obtained with the photonic needle at a set of different pre-defined positions (M1, M2&#xD;
      and M3) encountered along the needle trajectory during above-mentioned procedures, and to&#xD;
      detect potential intravascular positioning of the needle-tip at the target point (M4 -&#xD;
      blood), Study design: this is a single blind observational study. Study population: Patients&#xD;
      who have radicular pain on lumbar level, for example caused by disc herniation, and/or&#xD;
      lateral recessus stenosis and/or radiculopathy eci.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters are: 1) successfully acquired&#xD;
      diffuse reflectance spectra obtained at measurement point M4: midforaminal, halfway the&#xD;
      foramen (the target treatment location) as encountered during image-guided intraforaminal&#xD;
      injections on lumbar level, 2) confirmation of target area with fluoroscopy and injection of&#xD;
      contrast fluid (gold standard), 3) &quot;Certainty score&quot; on a 3-point scale (1 = uncertain, 2 =&#xD;
      certain, 3 = very certain) will be provided by the physician. The type of tissue present at&#xD;
      the needle tip will be based on the information available from imaging .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary study parameters are: 1) successfully acquired diffuse reflectance spectra&#xD;
      obtained at measurement points M1-M3: M1 in muscle, M2 extra-foraminal, M3 foraminal at a&#xD;
      distance 1/3 of the diameter of the foramen from the entrance of the foramen, as encountered&#xD;
      during image-guided intraforaminal injections on lumbar level, 2) successfully acquired&#xD;
      diffuse reflectance spectra obtained at measurement point M4, in case of a vascular puncture&#xD;
      (M4-blood), 3) confirmation images by ultrasound imaging at location M1 as described above,&#xD;
      4) confirmation images by fluoroscopy at locations M2 and M3, 5) digital subtraction&#xD;
      angiography images after contrast injection at location M4, confirming vascular penetration&#xD;
      (gold standard for vessel puncture), 6) &quot;Certainty score&quot; on a 3-point scale (1 = uncertain,&#xD;
      2 = certain, 3 = very certain) provided by the physician for assignment of the type of tissue&#xD;
      present at the needle tip, based on the information available from imaging at M1 and at M4.&#xD;
