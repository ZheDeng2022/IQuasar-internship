    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for a pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug&#xD;
      interaction between INX-08189 and extended release verapamil hydrochloride (verapamil HCL&#xD;
      ER).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-sequence, crossover, drug-drug interaction study&#xD;
      in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the safety of a single dose of INX-08189 (50 mg) alone and combined with&#xD;
      verapamil HCL ER (240 mg) after subjects receive verapamil HCL ER QD for 6 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effect of multiple doses of verapamil HCL ER (240 mg) on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of INX-08189 and the metabolite INX-08032, and the effect of a&#xD;
      single dose of INX-08189 on the PK profile of verapamil and the metabolite norverapamil&#xD;
