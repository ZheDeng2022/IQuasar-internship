      Although the initial treatment of malignant gliomas is well established, the best treatment&#xD;
      for progressive disease remains undefined. Patients with newly diagnosed gliomas are&#xD;
      typically treated with surgery followed by conformal radiation and concomitant chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Even though these tumors are not curable, prolonged survival can be achieved in selected&#xD;
      patients. Despite improved multimodal therapies, almost all of the patients experience&#xD;
      recurrence at the site of the primary tumor where they have already received maximal surgical&#xD;
      resection and radiation therapy. Typically, these patients have a life expectancy of&#xD;
      approximately 6 months, with less than a third of patients alive at one year. Salvage therapy&#xD;
      for these patients usually take the form of various systemic chemotherapeutic agents because&#xD;
      localized therapies such as reirradiation may not be possible in the previously irradiated&#xD;
      site. As progressive disease has very poor response rates to current systemic therapies,&#xD;
      efforts to define the role of novel local therapies, such as MR guided focused ultrasound&#xD;
      (MRgFUS), is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are very few local therapy options for progressive gliomas. Traditionally,&#xD;
      reirradiation and surgery are considered last resort treatments for symptomatic recurrence.&#xD;
      In the initial treatment of gliomas, the tumor and surrounding brain receive near tolerance&#xD;
      doses and usually preclude a second course of radiation therapy. If clinically advisable and&#xD;
      feasible, a second operation may be undertaken but is usually reserved for younger patients&#xD;
      with a good neurological status who are developing neurological symptoms related to the mass&#xD;
      effect of the tumor. The use of MR guided focused ultrasound represents a new, noninvasive&#xD;
      therapeutic option that overcomes some of the limitations of secondary surgery or&#xD;
      reirradiation and provides the patient with an option for local ablative therapy. The&#xD;
      lesioning of the tumor is done accurately under MRI guidance with real-time monitoring of the&#xD;
      ablative ultrasonic hyperthermia. As the cytotoxic affects are due to hyperthermia, there is&#xD;
      no cumulative radiation affect which limits the use of radiotherapy in recurrent disease. The&#xD;
      potential benefits for the patient include local control of the disease/tumor, and prolonging&#xD;
      the time to subsequent salvage therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar situation exists for brain metastases. Historically, the development of brain&#xD;
      metastases was considered a terminal event, however, with better local therapies as well a&#xD;
      systemic therapies, patients are living longer. Initial management of patients with brain&#xD;
      metastases usually involves surgery, whole brain radiation, radiosurgery or a combination of&#xD;
      these modalities depending on the clinical situation. The goal of treating brain metastases&#xD;
      is to prevent the patient from succumbing to CNS disease. As improved systemic therapy has&#xD;
      lengthened the survival of patients with metastatic tumors, more patients are surviving and&#xD;
      developing recurrent or progressive metastatic CNS disease. Progressive disease usually&#xD;
      requires more local therapies as chemotherapeutic agents do not adequately cross the blood&#xD;
      brain barrier to have a large impact on CNS metastases. MRIgFUS could play and important role&#xD;
      in ablating brain metastases in patients who have already been maximally radiated and are&#xD;
      otherwise without options.&#xD;
