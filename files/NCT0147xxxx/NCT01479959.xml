  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate communication is a major part of the quality of life of tracheostomized ventilator&#xD;
      dependent patients. Maintaining speech is therefore major goal in the management of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during ventilation has allowed the&#xD;
      improvement of speech. The best level for speech may vary from one patient to the other The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine individually the most efficient PEEP level in terms of&#xD;
      speech while obtaining the most secure condition and the best possible respiratory tolerance.&#xD;
      In order to improve the latter, the investigators will use a device which allows the patients&#xD;
      to control the activation of PEEP so that they can use it only when needed (i.e. when they&#xD;
      wish to speak). The investigators will compare the effect of different PEEP level to try to&#xD;
      determine the best compromise to improve speech in tracheostomized ventilator-dependent&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Context :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allowing a functional communication is a major issue in order to preserve quality of life in&#xD;
      tracheostomized ventilator-dependent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We showed in a previous study that the use of a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in&#xD;
      neuromuscular tracheostomized ventilator-dependent patients improved speech as it allows the&#xD;
      patient to expire (at least partly) through the upper airways therefore to speak during&#xD;
      expiration. The use of PEEP has been compared to the use of a phonation valve placed on the&#xD;
      ventilator circuit which allows a complete expiration through the upper airways and therefore&#xD;
      speech. Both techniques seem similar in terms of efficiency on speech; PEEP, however, is&#xD;
      better tolerated and seems to be more secure (the system remains open during expiration&#xD;
      decreasing the risk of high pressure, it does not require any handling of the ventilator&#xD;
      circuit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal PEEP level allowing the patient to expire the total expiratory volume through the&#xD;
      upper airways PEEPeff may vary from one patient to the other. We seek to determine individual&#xD;
      PEEPeff and to compare it to 50% of its value (PEEPef50). Indeed, while PEEPeff may&#xD;
      constitute the best level for expiratory speech as it mimics the mechanisms of a phonation&#xD;
      valve without some of its fallbacks, by preventing expiration through the expiratory circuit&#xD;
      of the ventilator, it also may lengthen expiration, delaying inspiration which allows speech,&#xD;
      and facilitate hyperinflation leading to respiratory discomfort as we have previously&#xD;
      observed with some patients using a phonation valve. Optimal PEEP level would be the best&#xD;
      compromise between best possible phonation and best possible respiratory comfort and&#xD;
      therefore could be lower than PEEPeff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve respiratory comfort with higher PEEP level, we developed a prototype&#xD;
      ventilator in which PEEP is activated by a switch under the control of patients who may&#xD;
      activate it only when needed (during speech period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to optimize PEEP use both by determining individually its&#xD;
      most appropriate level and by evaluation its use overtime to allow the best possible speech&#xD;
      with the best respiratory comfort and the most secure condition for tracheostomized&#xD;
      ventilated patients. Different PEEP levels will be evaluated and PEEP activation will be&#xD;
      controlled by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open randomized monocentric cross-over study (the patients are their own control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal PEEP level (PEEPeff), defined as PEEP-level allowing complete expiration through the&#xD;
      upper airways, will be determined for each patient. Speech and respiratory parameters were&#xD;
      studied without PEEP, with PEEPeff and an intermediate PEEP-level(PEEP50). Flow and airway&#xD;
      pressure will be measure and upper airways resistance will be calculated. Microphone speech&#xD;
      recordings were subjected to both quantitative measurements and qualitative assessments of&#xD;
      speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each PEEP level the following protocol will be conducted: 5 minutes of quiet breathing&#xD;
      with PEEP, 10 minutes spontaneous conversation, then speech trial(maximal sustained sound,&#xD;
      glissando, text reading).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective evaluation of speech and respiratory comfort(by the patient) and objective&#xD;
      evaluation of speech improvement according to PEEP level (reading duration, phonation&#xD;
      duration, voice quality, assessments of speech including an intelligibility score, a&#xD;
      perceptual score and an evaluation of prosody analyzed by two experimented speech therapists&#xD;
      blinded to PEEP level). Evaluation of the PEEP control button use by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular adult patients, tracheotomized and on long-term ventilation with a cuffless&#xD;
      tube, on assist-control volumetric ventilation, in stable state at the time of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients, center:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering it is a pilot study, 14 subjects will be included for the study. The subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited in the home ventilation unit of the intensive care department of the R.&#xD;
      Poincare teaching hospital (Garches, France) during their usual follow-up for their chronic&#xD;
      respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: 12 months. Duration of participation for each patient will be 1h30.&#xD;
