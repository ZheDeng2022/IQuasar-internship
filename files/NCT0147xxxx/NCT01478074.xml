    <textblock>
      This is a single-center open-label phase I clinical trial of delivering haploidentical&#xD;
      natural killer (NK) cells matured ex vivo with ALT-801 followed by intravenous infusions of&#xD;
      ALT-801 in patients with relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and MDACC Children's Cancer Hospital in&#xD;
      Houston, Texas.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is an effective treatment for acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). For patients transplanted in first&#xD;
      remission or with low risk MDS, approximately 60% of patients have achieved long-term disease&#xD;
      free survival. Patients with relapsed leukemia have a poorer outcome; the long-term disease&#xD;
      free survival rate for relapsed AML is 5-10% without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (HSCT). With HSCT, survival after relapse approaches 40%, but success depends greatly on&#xD;
      whether patients are in remission at the time of transplant. Many relapsed patients have&#xD;
      refractory chemoresistant disease and never attain remission to be eligible for potentially&#xD;
      curative HSCT, or develop significant complicating comorbidities during the prolonged&#xD;
      intensive reinduction of their disease. Thus, improved strategies for achieving remission in&#xD;
      relapsed patients prior to transplantation are critical to improving the survival of these&#xD;
      patients. Relapsed/refractory AML requires remission prior to allogeneic HSCT for optimal&#xD;
      survival, but responds poorly to chemotherapy. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical,&#xD;
      NK-enriched peripheral blood cell infusions may augment induction chemotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with poor prognosis AML, but there are significant toxicities related to the IL-2 infusions&#xD;
      given for optimal NK cell activity. The purpose of this trial is to estimate the toxicity and&#xD;
      feasibility of treating relapsed/refractory AML with FLAG chemotherapy followed by&#xD;
      haploidentical donor-derived natural killer (NK) cells using ALT-801 for ex vivo and in vivo&#xD;
      NK cell activation as an alternative to interleukin-2 (IL-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALT-801 is a genetically engineered fusion protein, that is, a single protein made by&#xD;
      combining the DNA of two or more different genes. ALT-801 is a combination of IL-2 (an&#xD;
      important protein for stimulating immune cells) and a binding portion that recognizes tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of an infused&#xD;
      allogeneic donor NK cell product and ALT-801 following a FLAG preparative regimen to treat&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia. The primary endpoint for toxicity is the&#xD;
      absence of NK cell Product or ALT-801-related grade 2 toxicity, excluding grade 2 fever,&#xD;
      rigor/chills, fatigue, vomiting/nausea, pruritus/itching, electrolyte imbalance,&#xD;
      hypoalbuminemia or lymphopenia within 21 days of the ALT-801 or NK cell product infusion. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of feasibility is defined as being able to infuse NK-cells at the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated cell dose or the highest dose level on day 0 and complete all 8 planned doses of&#xD;
      ALT-801, with a safety that does not exceed toxicity limits, in greater than or equal to 7 of&#xD;
      10 subjects.&#xD;
