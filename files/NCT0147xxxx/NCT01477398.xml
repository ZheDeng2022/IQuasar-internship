      The proposed study will measure the incidence of adverse events and the decrease in time to&#xD;
      meet discharge criteria from the post anesthesia care unit when hypercapnic and hyperpnoea&#xD;
      are used during emergence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypercapnia has been used in conjunction with hyperpnoea to provide a more rapid return of&#xD;
      responsiveness after inhaled anesthesia. The benefits of accelerating patient recovery in the&#xD;
      operating room may extend to the post anesthesia care unit if the patient is more alert and&#xD;
      easier to care for when they arrive in the unit. Respiratory patterns and gas levels -&#xD;
      including CO2, O2, and anesthetic vapor - will be measured in order to better understand a&#xD;
      patient's respiratory status during recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Feb 2009 we finished our first study (IRB 26111) and submitted a publication. The journal&#xD;
      reviewers identified a serious limitation: we could not report whether the treated patients&#xD;
      recovered from anesthesia faster because the treatment (inspired CO2) caused them to breath&#xD;
      more vigorously or because the treatment caused the anesthetic vapors to be cleared more&#xD;
      rapidly from the brain. Our new application uses essentially the same study protocol as the&#xD;
      former study but adds chest bands to measure the patient's rate of breathing and expired gas&#xD;
      monitoring to measure the rate at which the vapors are removed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  adult ASA class I-III subjects of both genders scheduled to undergo eye surgery at the&#xD;
             Moran Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a history of renal or hepatic disease, chronic alcohol or drug abuse, disabling&#xD;
             neuropsychiatric disorder, hypersensitivity, or unusual response to other halogenated&#xD;
             anesthetics, pulmonary hypertension, increased intracranial pressure, seizure&#xD;
             disorder, or personal/familial history of malignant hyperthermia, and current smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will also be excluded if they are currently being treated with known hepatic&#xD;
             enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenobarbital, dilantin, or isoniazid) or with drugs&#xD;
             known to alter anesthetic requirements (e.g., opiates, clonidine, alpha2 agonists,&#xD;
             alcohol, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines or other&#xD;
             tranquilizers).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will also be excluded if they have intolerance to non-steroidal&#xD;
             anti-inflammatories.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition subjects who have received general anesthesia within the previous 7 days,&#xD;
             received any investigational drug within the previous 28 days, or participated in a&#xD;
             previous isoflurane or desflurane study will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects can be neither pregnant nor breast feeding.&#xD;

          -  Subjects with significant restrictive lung disease will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects passing these criteria will be further evaluated with a medical history&#xD;
             including medications, abbreviated physical examination, clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
             (urine drug test), and a urine or serum human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test&#xD;
             for women with childbearing potential.&#xD;
