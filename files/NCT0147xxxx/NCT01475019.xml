      The first aim of the investigators study, was to investigate the combined effect of&#xD;
      diet,physical exercise and orlistat, for 24 weeks, on serum Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH)&#xD;
      levels in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and in obese controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other aim of the investigators study, was to examine the effect of hypocaloric&#xD;

      The first aim of our study, was to investigate the combined effect of diet,physical exercise&#xD;
      and orlistat, for 24 weeks, on serum Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) levels in obese women with&#xD;
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and in obese controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included sixty one (61) women with PCOS (mean age: 26.11±6.86 and mean body mass&#xD;
      index: 34.83±6.39), matched for age and body mass index (BMI) with twenty (20) obese women&#xD;
      without PCOS (mean age: 26.95±4.77 and mean BMI: 36.79±6.98). Diagnosis of PCOS was based on&#xD;
      the 2003 Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, a moderate daily physical activity and a normal-protein, energy restricted diet were&#xD;
      prescribed based on a calculated individual basal metabolic rate (BMR) of all women (BMR-600&#xD;
      kcal/d), for a period of 24 weeks. In addition, orlistat (Xenical, Roche S.A., Greece; 120&#xD;
      mg, 3 times per day) was administered before each meal, for 24 weeks. At baseline, week 12,&#xD;
      and week 24, at 9:00 AM, after an overnight fast, subjects were weighed. Waist and hip&#xD;
      circumferences were measured in duplicate. Blood samples were collected and the basal serum&#xD;
      levels of AMH, FSH, LH, PRL, T, D4A, DHEAS, 17a-hydroxyprogesterone (17a-OHP), SHBG, glucose,&#xD;
      and insulin were measured. AMH concentrations were measured with an enzymatically amplified&#xD;
      two-sided immunoassay [DSL-10-14400 Active Müllerian Inhibiting Substance/AMH enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, DSL Laboratories, Webster, TX]. The theoretical sensitivity&#xD;
      of the method is 0.006 ng/ml, the intra-assay coefficient of variation for high values is&#xD;
      3.3% and the interassay coefficient of variation for high values is 6.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also studied the changes of mean number of follicles (expressed as the mean number of&#xD;
      follicles of both ovaries= follicles of right ovary+ follicles of left ovary/2) and mean&#xD;
      ovarian volume (expressed as the mean volume of both ovaries= volume of right ovary+ volume&#xD;
      of left ovary/2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other aim of our study, was to examine the effect of hypocaloric diet,physical exercise&#xD;
      plus sibutramine on serum AMH levels, body composition, hormonal and metabolic parameters in&#xD;
      overweight and obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatients, premenopausal, nonpregnant, nonlactating, overweight and obese women (body mass&#xD;
      index, BMI &gt;27), 18 years of age and older with PCOS were recruited for this study. The study&#xD;
      included fifty seven (57) women with PCOS (mean age: 26.11±6.86 and mean body mass index:&#xD;
      34.83±6.39) who, besides diet and exercise, received Sibutramine treatment, matched for age&#xD;
      and body mass index (BMI) with nineteen (19) obese women with PCOS (mean age: 26.95±4.77 and&#xD;
      mean BMI: 36.79±6.98) treated only with diet and exercise. Diagnosis of PCOS was based on the&#xD;
      2003 Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus criteria . Women with no classical&#xD;
      21-hydroxylase deficiency, hyperprolactinemia, adrenal or ovarian tumor and Cushing's disease&#xD;
      were excluded by the appropriate tests. Other exclusion criteria were hypertension, thyroid&#xD;
      dysfunction, overt diabetes mellitus and concomitant treatment, such as antihypertensive&#xD;
      drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or other SNRI drug, oral contraceptive pills or&#xD;
      any other antiandrogen treatment (cyproterone acetate, spirolactone, luteinizing hormone (LH)&#xD;
      release hormone agonist) and insulin-sensitizing agents (metformin, pioglitazone,&#xD;
      rosiglitazone) that may interact with insulin sensitivity and lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, all patients were placed in a hypocaloric diet plus sibutramine (10mg per day) for&#xD;
      the first month and then on a hypocaloric diet plus sibutramine (10mg per day) or hypocaloric&#xD;
      diet only for the subsequent 6 months. A moderate physical activity (3 hours per week) and a&#xD;
      normal-protein, energy restricted diet were prescribed based on a calculated individual basal&#xD;
      metabolic rate (BMR) of all women (BMR-600 kcal/d), for a period of 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, week 12, and week 24, at 9:00 AM, after an overnight fast, subjects were&#xD;
      weighed. Waist and hip circumferences were measured in duplicate. Blood samples were&#xD;
      collected and the basal serum levels of AMH, FSH, LH, PRL, T, D4A, DHEAS,&#xD;
      17a-hydroxyprogesterone (17a-OHP), SHBG, glucose, and insulin were measured. AMH&#xD;
      concentrations were measured with an enzymatically amplified two-sided immunoassay&#xD;
      [DSL-10-14400 Active Müllerian Inhibiting Substance/AMH enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      (ELISA) kit, DSL Laboratories, Webster, TX].&#xD;
