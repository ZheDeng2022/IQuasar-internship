  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) are a common musculoskeletal problem with an&#xD;
      estimated 40-75 percent of the population reporting at least one sign. Up to fifteen percent&#xD;
      of the patients who seek care for one of these conditions, will go on to develop chronic&#xD;
      pain. The two most common TMD conditions include myofascial pain disorder and internal&#xD;
      derangement of the Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ). These two conditions have similar clinical&#xD;
      presentations, making an accurate diagnosis difficult. Currently, there is no accurate exam&#xD;
      or test to differentiate between these two conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal derangement of the TMJ is a condition with disk displacement, pain, and dysfunction,&#xD;
      which may progress to localized osteoarthritis. Fortunately, this condition is self-limiting&#xD;
      for the majority of the patients afflicted, with a small minority progressing to advanced&#xD;
      joint destruction, disability and chronic pain.18 Currently there are no prognostic&#xD;
      indicators to identify these individuals. There are three hypothesis of degenerative TMJ&#xD;
      disease, they include: direct mechanical trauma, hypoxia reperfusion injuries, and neurogenic&#xD;
      inflammation. All involve parafunctional habits such as clenching or grinding by the patient&#xD;
      and a low-grade inflammatory response/synovitis. 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG), a&#xD;
      radioisotope used with positron emission tomography (PET) and paired with a CT scan (PET/CT),&#xD;
      may have a role in imaging inflammation in arthritis as recently demonstrated in several&#xD;
      pilot studies involving osteoarthritis of the knee and shoulder. 18-FDG accumulates in areas&#xD;
      of increased metabolism, particularly activated leukocytes, as measured by increased&#xD;
      standardized uptake value.2 PET/CT offers the unique advantage of showing active disease&#xD;
      before anatomic damage is evident. Our hypothesis is that there is an increased uptake of&#xD;
      18-FDG on PET/CT in synovitis of the TMJ.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, pilot study to evaluate the ability of PET/CT with FDG&#xD;
      to detect synovitis of the temporomandibular joint. Patients presenting to the Department of&#xD;
      Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with&#xD;
      symptomatic internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint requiring arthroscopy will be&#xD;
      compared to control subjects. Key inclusion criteria include any individual found to have a&#xD;
      primary diagnosis of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint requiring&#xD;
      arthroscopy as determined by the treating physician. All patients will have failed a trial&#xD;
      period of &quot;conservative treatment therapy&quot; including occlusal splint therapy, NSAIDs, or&#xD;
      muscle relaxants for a period no less than eight weeks. Exclusion criteria will include&#xD;
      patients not medically stable to undergo arthroscopy under general anesthesia, patients with&#xD;
      overlying infection of the skin, patients with conditions other than internal derangement&#xD;
      causing temporomandibular pain or dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient has been identified as eligible for the study, the treating physician will&#xD;
      contact a member of the study team. Each participating patient will undergo a standardized&#xD;
      exam, the research diagnostic criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD). A member of the research team, from&#xD;
      the department of oral medicine, will administer this exam. This standardized exam has been&#xD;
      previously validated in the literature, and each member of the research team will undergo&#xD;
      training and calibration prior to administering the RDC/TMD. This exam will be performed on&#xD;
      the day of the arthroscopy. In addition, each patient will be given a Wilkes score, based on&#xD;
      the Wilkes classification of internal derangement.36 The patient will then undergo&#xD;
      arthroscopy of the temporomandibular joint as per the treating physician. TMJ arthroscopy&#xD;
      includes: a small incision in front of the ear, introduction of an arthroscope and irrigation&#xD;
      needle into the joint space, irrigation of fluid, and at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician may include the lysis of adhesion and the introduction of medication into the&#xD;
      joint. At the time of the procedure, the synovitis score will be determined based on an&#xD;
      eleven point synovitis scale as described by Murakami, with zero being absence of synovial&#xD;
      inflammation. This scoring is bone by observation, and is typically include in the&#xD;
      arthroscopy procedure for diagnosis. The patient will also be given a binomial score of&#xD;
      presence or absence of synovitis. A representative photograph will be obtained of the&#xD;
      patient's joint during arthroscopy, as is routinely done during this procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the procedure, the patients will have undergone a PET/CT scan to evaluate the TMJ.&#xD;
      This radiographic exam will be limited to the head and neck region in order to minimize&#xD;
      radiation exposure. The radiologists reading the study will be blinded to the results of the&#xD;
      clinical exam and condition. The results of the PET/CT study will be given as a binomial&#xD;
      score of positive or negative and given a continuous score based on uptake relative to the&#xD;
      unaffected joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects will undergo the RDC/TMD standardized exam prior to the radiographic study,&#xD;
      and only have the PET/CT performed, with no subsequent intervention. These patients will be&#xD;
      aged matched to the treatment subjects. This information will then be utilized to determine&#xD;
      the utility of PET/CT in the detection of synovitis of the temporomandibular joint.&#xD;
