    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety of combining two agents (everolimus and BKM120) for the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced cancer arising from solid organ in patients who are no longer&#xD;
      benefiting from or unable to withstand standard treatment of these conditions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the combination of two anticancer drugs, everolimus&#xD;
      (RAD001) and BKM120, in patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard treatment&#xD;
      or patients who are unable to tolerate the standard treatment for their cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators seek to establish the safety of taking these two medications together and to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate doses of the two drugs when given together as well as identify&#xD;
      potential side effects when the drugs are administered together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and side effects of the&#xD;
      combination of RAD001 and BKM120 by looking at the patient's response to the treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators want to find out what effects, good or bad, the drugs have on the patient's&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also look at specific biomarkers in the patient's blood and in the tumor&#xD;
      tissue which are involved in the growth of tumor cells and determine if the levels of these&#xD;
      biomarkers are related to the patient's response to treatment or development of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus, also known by the brand name, Afinitor, is a biologic drug approved by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of kidney cancer. It works by preventing&#xD;
      cancer cell from multiplying and it also renders them easily susceptible to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BKM120 is a new study drug that is being tested for its ability to treat cancer. However, it&#xD;
      has not yet been approved by the FDA for the treatment of any specific cancer type.&#xD;

    <description>BKM120 (20mg to 100mg) will be self-administered (by the patients themselves). The investigator will instruct the patient to take the study drug exactly as specified in the protocol. BKM120 will be administered on a continuous once daily dosing schedule. Patients should be instructed to take the dose of BKM120 daily in the morning, one hour after a light breakfast (morning meal) at approximately the same time each day. BKM120 should be taken with a glass of water and consumed over as short a time as possible. Patients should swallow the capsules as a whole and not chew them. Patients should continue to fast for 2 hours after the administration of each BKM120 dose.</description>

             of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio,&#xD;

             to starting study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical conditions (e.g.,&#xD;
             active or uncontrolled infection) that could cause unacceptable safety risks or&#xD;

&#xD;
         27. Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
