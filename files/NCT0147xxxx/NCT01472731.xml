    <textblock>
      Brain tumors account for only 2% of all cancers but result in a disproportionate share of&#xD;
      cancer morbidity and mortality. The five-year survival rates for the most common histologic&#xD;
      subtypes, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma (glioblastoma multiforme, GBM), are 30% and&#xD;
      10%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs affecting transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) might be of great interest for malignant&#xD;
      glioma treatment. TGF-β is an oncogenic factor in advanced tumors where it induces&#xD;
      proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis as well as suppresses the antitumoral&#xD;
      immune response. In addition TGF-β and its TGF-β receptors, TβRI and TβRII, are overexpressed&#xD;
      in GBMs. TGF-β signaling is involved in multiple steps of GBM development. GC1008 is an&#xD;
      antibody that is capable of neutralizing TGF-β and may therefore offer a new treatment option&#xD;
      for patients with malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For therapeutic success, it may be essential for GC1008 to reach the target site, in this&#xD;
      case located in the brain. We will be able to prove this with 89Zr-GC1008 PET imaging. This&#xD;
      imaging method also allows quantification of the amount of GC1008 reaching the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of 2 parts. In part 1, patients with a suspicion of a malignant glioma&#xD;
      undergo an 89Zr-GC1008 PET scan before standard (surgical)treatment. In part 2, patients with&#xD;
      relapsed malignant glioma will undergo an 89Zr-GC1008 PET scan and will be treated with&#xD;
      GC1008 in a phase II study as there is no standard treatment for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that GC1008 uptake in brain tumors can be visualized and quantified using the&#xD;
      89Zr-GC1008 PET scan and GC1008 might offer a new treatment option for patients with relapsed&#xD;
      malignant gliomas.&#xD;

      Brain tumors account for only 2% of all cancers but result in a disproportionate share of&#xD;
      cancer morbidity and mortality. The five-year survival rates for the most common histologic&#xD;
      subtypes, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma (glioblastoma multiforme, GBM), are 30% and&#xD;
      10%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, the standard treatment of malignant glioma is focused on cell death induction&#xD;
      by DNA damage, neglecting the fact that invasion into surrounding brain tissue is a&#xD;
      fundamental feature of and the major reason for treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs affecting transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) might be of great interest for malignant&#xD;
      glioma treatment. The reason for this is the fact that TGF-β acts as a tumor suppressor in&#xD;
      normal epithelial cells and early-stage tumors but transforms in an oncogenic factor in&#xD;
      advanced tumors where it induces proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis as&#xD;
      well as suppresses the antitumoral immune response. In addition TGF-β expression and its&#xD;
      TGF-β receptors, TβRI and TβRII, are overexpressed in GBMs. TGF-β signaling is involved in&#xD;
      multiple steps of GBM development (Golestaneh, Mishra, 2005) and invasion (Wesolowska et al,&#xD;
      2008). Plasma TGF-β levels are elevated in GBM patients and decrease after surgical tumor&#xD;
      resection (Schneider et al, 2006). Progression-free survival and overall survival are worse&#xD;
      for malignant glioma patients with high TGF-β signaling compared with glioma patients with&#xD;
      low TGF-β signaling activity (Bruna et al, 2007). All these features make TGF-β a promising&#xD;
      target molecule for biological treatment approaches for GBM (Wick et al, 2006). Phase&#xD;
      I/II-studies with the TGF-β2-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide AP12009 in malignant&#xD;
      glioma showed promising results (Hau et al, 2007). Another approach to target TGF-β is with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as GC1008. GC1008 is a fully human IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      capable of neutralizing all mammalian isoforms of TGF-β (i.e., 1, 2, and 3). For therapeutic&#xD;
      success, it may be essential for GC1008 to reach the target site, in this case located in the&#xD;
      brain. Our own data with 89Zr-bevacizumab, which is also an IgG, showed that the VEGF&#xD;
      directed antibody bevacizumab penetrates the brain and is localized in brain metastases. We&#xD;
      therefore expect GC1008 to reach the malignant glioma as well. In order to initiate clinical&#xD;
      trials with TGF-β antibody in these patients it would clearly be of great help to prove that&#xD;
      the drug arrives at the tumor site. 89Zr-GC1008 PET imaging will allow us to prove this. In&#xD;
      addition, PET imaging allows quantification of the amount of GC1008 reaching the malignant&#xD;
      glioma. A phase II study with GC1008 in patients with relapsed malignant gliomas will be&#xD;
      initiated as currently, there is no standard treatment available for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;

      glioma to assess if GC1008 penetrates into the brain tumor and to quantify its uptake.&#xD;
