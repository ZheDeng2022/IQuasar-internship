  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide information on how the practicing of diaphragmatic&#xD;
      breathing retraining (DBR) for 8-week at home may improve the health outcomes and encourage&#xD;
      heart failure patients to engage in health-promoting activities by successfully controlling&#xD;
      their shortness of breath (dyspnea).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In heart failure (HF) patients, dyspnea is a key contributor to and the strongest predictor&#xD;
      for hospital readmission. In addition, dyspnea and fatigue are the primary reasons for&#xD;
      decreased physical activity (PA) which, in turn, leads to activity avoidance, subsequent&#xD;
      muscle de-conditioning, and further increases of dyspnea even at lower levels of activity.&#xD;
      Depression, because of its moderate relationship with dyspnea, can further diminish PA and&#xD;
      increase disability in activities of daily living (ADLs). Strategies to minimize or mitigate&#xD;
      dyspnea and to boost motivation are imperative for improving adherence to PA, and, in turn,&#xD;
      improving fatigue, muscle strength, PA itself, functional status, disability in ADLs&#xD;
      including basic ADLs and instrumental ADLs (IADLs), depression, and quality of life (QOL) in&#xD;
      HF patients. The overall purpose of this pilot/feasibility study is to evaluate an 8-week,&#xD;
      home-based DBR intervention, in HF patients who are experiencing dyspnea at rest or with&#xD;
      daily activities. Using an experimental randomized controlled design, 50 participants over 19&#xD;
      years of age, with diagnosed with chronic HF, who experience dyspnea at rest or with activity&#xD;
      and experience dyspnea that limits their activities, who have a telephone, and who reside in&#xD;
      a rural area, will be recruited at the University of Nebraska Medical Center HF clinic and at&#xD;
      the Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Hospital, Cardiology-Congestive Heart Failure&#xD;
      clinic. Both groups will receive the usual care from a HF specialist. The experimental group&#xD;
      will receive information on a Diaphragmatic Breathing Retraining (DBR) intervention whereas&#xD;
      the health promotion (attention control) group will receive general health information. To&#xD;
      boost adherence to the intervention and to prevent attrition from the study, both groups will&#xD;
      receive telephone calls from a research nurse for a total of 4 sessions (weeks 1, 2, 4 and&#xD;
      6). During follow-ups via phone calls for the attention control group, the research personnel&#xD;
      will discuss health promotion topics (e.g., lipids profile, health eating, cancer screening,&#xD;
      and annual check-ups (e.g., flu shot, eye and/or dental exams) with their primary health care&#xD;
      provider. Data collection using standardized measures, will take place at baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up after completion of the 8-week intervention. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes are: dyspnea and fatigue. The secondary outcomes are: muscle strength, PA,&#xD;
      functional status, depression, disability in ADLs, and quality of life.&#xD;
