  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite a relatively high prevalence of non-atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (NACAD)&#xD;
      among young women, the majority of these abnormalities were misdiagnosed in this population,&#xD;
      and thus treatments were not targeted adequately in this patient population. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      short and long-term cardiovascular outcomes of young women with NACAD have not been&#xD;
      evaluated. Given the importance of NACAD in young women, the challenges of diagnosis and&#xD;
      subsequent treatment, and unknown outcomes with NACAD, we propose a prospective registry to&#xD;
      further evaluate this population. We propose to evaluate young women (age &lt; or equal to 55)&#xD;
      presenting with myocardial infarction (MI) prospectively, to diagnose the etiology of MI&#xD;
      differentiating atherosclerotic versus NACAD, to correlate the prevalence of FMD in other&#xD;
      vascular territory, and to evaluate the long-term outcome of young women with NACAD in&#xD;
      comparison to those with atherosclerotic CAD over a 5-year follow-up.&#xD;

      All women aged 55 or younger having a coronary angiogram for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)&#xD;
      will be approached prior to their procedure. A pregnancy test will be performed (standard for&#xD;
      pre-menopausal women due to potential radiation exposure). If the cause of the heart attack&#xD;
      is uncertain (eg no obvious infarct-related narrowing or occlusion), intravascular ultrasound&#xD;
      or optimal coherence tomography will be performed within the context of the angiogram to&#xD;
      better view the artery wall. A picture of the iliac and renal arteries will be accomplished&#xD;
      by aortography (one dye shot down the aorta); in the case that the renal arteries are not&#xD;
      well visualized, selective renal angiography will be performed (catheter at the entry to the&#xD;
      renal artery). In the case of suspected non-atherosclerotic abnormalities, a head CT&#xD;
      angiogram wil be performed. Referral to appropriate specialists for detected abnormality will&#xD;
      occur. If symptoms continue, the subject will be followed by a cardiologist. A research&#xD;
      coordinator will contact the subject at 1, 6 and 12 months and then annually to collect data&#xD;
      on medications, hospitalization and symptoms.&#xD;
