      This study will explore how liver impairment affects blood levels of LY2140023 (a prodrug)&#xD;
      and its active metabolite (LY404039).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included 4 groups, based on the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic impairment as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Participants with normal hepatic function (Control); Group 2: Participants with mild&#xD;
      hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A); Group 3: Participants with moderate hepatic&#xD;
      impairment (Child-Pugh class B); and Group 4: Participants with severe hepatic impairment&#xD;
      (Child-Pugh class C).&#xD;
