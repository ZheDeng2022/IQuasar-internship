  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this phase II study of STA-1 capsule was to make preliminary evaluation on&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and safety of STA-1 capsule in order that based on the dosage and study&#xD;
      structure planned in this project, the dosage and study structure of phase III study can be&#xD;
      confirmed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial was planned to be in double-blind, double-dummy,&#xD;
      active-controlled, parallel, comparative, multicenter design. Two hundred and 40 eligible&#xD;
      subjects were planned to be recruited by 5 study centers. The treatment period planned in the&#xD;
      protocol was 3 months with 5 study visits including Randomization visit (Day 0), three&#xD;
      post-treatment visits (1 and 2 months after Randomization visit and Final visit) and 1&#xD;
      follow-up visit made at 6 month after Randomization visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subjects recruited by this study having read and singed the ICF, they were arranged to&#xD;
      be collected information of demographics, medical history, allergy history, medication&#xD;
      history, and concomitant medication. Laboratory and physical examination including vital&#xD;
      signs were performed, and Hachinski Ischemia Score (HIS), Mini-Mental Status Examination&#xD;
      (MMSE), and Classification of Marrow-Sea deficiency were evaluated to ensure subject's&#xD;
      eligibility to enter this study. After the subjects were confirmed eligible, they were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either STA-1 or Ergoloid Mesylates group. Blessed-Roth Behavior Scale&#xD;
      (BBS) and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale were measured after subjects were&#xD;
      randomized. These subjects were then dispensed study medications for 1-month use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible subjects were requested to bring back unused study medication, if any, to study&#xD;
      centers at 1, 2, and 3 months (Final visit) after the Randomization visit. At these visits,&#xD;
      measurements of MMSE, BBS, ADL scales, and Classification of Marrow-Sea deficiency were&#xD;
      collected. Information concomitant medications and AEs were also recorded. Physical and&#xD;
      laboratory examinations were performed at Final visit. Each subject was dispensed with study&#xD;
      medications for his/her subsequent treatment period at month-1 and -2 visits. Unused study&#xD;
      medications were collected with drug accountability documented. Subjects were dismissed from&#xD;
      the study at the Final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were measured MMSE, BBS, and ADL scales at 6 months after the Randomization visit if&#xD;
      they were available for follow-up evaluations.&#xD;
