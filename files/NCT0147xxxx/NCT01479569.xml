      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pericardiocentesis uses a needle and small tube to drain fluid from space around the heart.&#xD;
      The most common reason to perform this procedure is that the fluid is interfering with heart&#xD;
      function. This procedure is usually guided by X-rays. However, researchers want to try the&#xD;
      procedure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instead of X-rays. MRI guidance may be more&#xD;
      precise than X-rays, which can make the procedure easier and more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test whether MRI guidance can improve pericardiocentesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who need to have pericardiocentesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical exam before the procedure. Blood samples will be&#xD;
           taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pericardiocentesis will be performed using MRI guidance. The procedure may take up&#xD;
           to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If for some reason the MRI guidance is not successful, participants will have the&#xD;
           regular X-ray procedure. The MRI system will be used to take high-quality pictures&#xD;
           afterward to check the results....&#xD;

      Pericardiocentesis is a minimally invasive procedure to drain fluid from the pericardial&#xD;
      space, created by the pericardial sac which cradles the heart. The most common reason to&#xD;
      perform this procedure is that pericardial fluid is interfering with heart function. The next&#xD;
      most common reason is to obtain pericardial fluid for testing to make a clinical diagnosis.&#xD;
      Pericardiocentesis is performed using a long needle that may be guided by various means&#xD;
      including blindly without imaging guidance, using electrocardiography electrodes to determine&#xD;
      when the needle accidentally touches the heart, using echocardiography, using X-ray with- or&#xD;
      without- contrast injections, or using a combination. Each has its advantages and&#xD;
      limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide heart catheterization&#xD;
      with tissue visualization but without X-ray radiation. When used to guide needle access to&#xD;
      the pericardial space or from there even into heart cavities, MRI provides superb imaging&#xD;
      guidance. What is especially valuable about MRI is that it provides the entire thoracic&#xD;
      context of needle access, allowing the operator to avoid critical structures including the&#xD;
      liver, lung, pleural space, and heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide heart catheterization&#xD;
      in patients with tissue visualization but without X-ray radiation. We also have used these&#xD;
      developments to guide needle access to the heart and pericardium in animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol we test the safety and feasibility of pericardiocentesis in adult patients,&#xD;
      using commercially available MRI-compatible (passive) needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this will enable more advanced minimally invasive procedures in adults and&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients, age greater than or equal to 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing medically necessary diagnostic or therapeutic pericardiocentesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiogenic shock (sustained systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 80 mm Hg&#xD;
             despite volume repletion on physical examination or requiring catecholamine support)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to undergo magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiac pacemaker or implantable defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cerebral aneurysm clip&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Neural stimulator (e.g. TENS-Unit)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any type of ear implant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metal shrapnel or bullet.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any implanted device (e.g. insulin pump, drug infusion device), unless it is&#xD;
                  labeled safe for MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST AGENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal excretory dysfunction, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73M(2)&#xD;
             body surface area according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Glomerular filtration rate will be estimated using the MDRD 2005 revised study&#xD;
             formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
             --eGFR (mL/min/1.73M(2))=175x(standardized s(cr)) (-1.154) x (age) (-0.203) x 0.742&#xD;
             (if the subject is female) or x1.212 (if the subject is black)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects meeting this exclusion criterion may still be included in the study but may&#xD;
             not be exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        RATIONALE FOR SELECTION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This is a technical development study with the prospect of direct benefit to&#xD;
             individual research subjects. The selection criteria are designed to minimize risk&#xD;
             while attaining the scientific objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult subjects are sought from among patients already undergoing medically necessary&#xD;
             pericardiocentesis. Children are excluded from this first proof-of-concept experience&#xD;
             to maximize safety; we anticipate a follow-on protocol that includes children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are excluded if they are not suitable for rapid entry into an interventional&#xD;
             MRI environment, so mechanical ventilation and cardiogenic shock are exclusion&#xD;
             criteria in this early experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with renal excretory dysfunction might be injured by gadolinium exposure and&#xD;
             are not exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents. Pregnant subjects are excluded&#xD;
             because of unknown risk and no benefit to a fetus. Magnetic resonance imaging will be&#xD;
             used to guide pericardiocentesis, so subjects must be eligible to undergo magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging safely.&#xD;
