      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether computerised working memory training&#xD;
      improves cognitive performance, ADHD symptoms, psychosocial functioning and quality of life&#xD;
      in adults with ADHD, from psychiatric outpatient clinics (N=100) as well as from a&#xD;
      high-security prison facility (N=50).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary aim is to evaluate whether 5 weeks of computerised working memory training&#xD;
      improves working memory capacity. Secondary aims are to explore whether improvements in&#xD;
      working memory capacity will be transferred to improvements in learning abilities and fluid&#xD;
      intelligence. Also, far transfer effects on executive functioning, ADHD symptoms,&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning and quality of life will be explored. Finally, it will also be&#xD;
      assessed to what extent improvements gained from 5 weeks of working memory training will be&#xD;
      maintained 3 and 6 months post-study, respectively.&#xD;
