    <textblock>
      Teen loss is not uncommon. Depression, emptiness, disbelief, hopelessness, and guilt are&#xD;
      typical responses. How teens with cancer cope with the loss of a loved one or a close friend&#xD;
      has not been well-studied in the bereavement or oncology literature. This study will describe&#xD;
      the impact of loss on teen patients who are on treatment or have recently completed treatment&#xD;
      for malignancy. We will look at baseline personality traits and ask teens to identify losses&#xD;
      in their life. We will ask questions about coping and meaning-making after loss. A parent&#xD;
      will be invited to participate -to measure parental awareness of teen loss and determine if&#xD;
      parental coping affects teen coping. The inventories have been validated by other&#xD;
      researchers.&#xD;

      All participants will asked to complete a bereavement questionnaire quantifying the losses&#xD;
      they have experienced. All participants will be screened for depression/anxiety as well as&#xD;
      life outlook using validated tools. Patients who identify that they have experienced the loss&#xD;
      of someone significant in their life on the bereavement questionnaire will continue with the&#xD;
      study and complete a battery of validated psychological inventories. They will be asked to&#xD;
      identify their most significant loss in regards to completion of the remainder of the&#xD;
      questionnaire. In addition, those who identify losing a friend to cancer will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in a 30-45 minute semi-structured interview (in person or via telephone) during a&#xD;
      second session with the study staff. This interview will be audiotaped, to allow for&#xD;
      transcription and analysis later. Parents will complete demographic information, the&#xD;
      bereavement questionnaire, and complete inventories of family coping / cohesion regardless of&#xD;
      child's responses to bereavement questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, those who identify losing a friend to cancer will be invited to participate in a&#xD;
      30-45 minute semi-structured interview (in person or via telephone) during a second session&#xD;
      with the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the prevalence of loss, with particular interest in the extent of peer loss, in&#xD;
           adolescent oncology patients who have been on therapy ≥ 12 months (≥ 6 months if&#xD;
           progressive or refractory disease) or off therapy for ≤ 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the impact of loss on adolescent oncology patients by focusing on coping&#xD;
           efficacy, psychological distress, meaning-making, and complicated bereavement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe parental knowledge of losses experienced by an adolescent child who has&#xD;
           recently undergone therapy.&#xD;
