  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged wound drainage following total joint replacement surgery has been shown to be a&#xD;
      predictor of postoperative infection. Several factors have been associated with delayed wound&#xD;
      healing and increased risk of infection. Namely hypertension, obesity, diabetes, smoking and&#xD;
      autoimmune disease have been shown to have a detrimental effect on wound healing. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to verify those findings and determine additional pharmacological, surgical&#xD;
      and patient related factors that may result in prolonged wound drainage, prolonged hospital&#xD;
      stay and increased risk of infection&#xD;

      Study type: Prospective cohort study. Inclusion criteria: All patients receiving primary&#xD;
      total hip or knee replacement surgery at Hvidovre Hospital from January 1st 2012 to December&#xD;
      31st 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: none Intervention: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      New hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypertension is associated with prolonged wound drainage and increased risk of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients receiving Statin treatment have decreased postoperative wound drainage and&#xD;
           decreased risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients receiving Bisphosphonate treatment have increased postoperative wound drainage&#xD;
           and increased risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured patient related risk variables: Age, sex, primary OA diagnosis, diabetes, smoking,&#xD;
      BMI, alcohol consumption, autoimmune disease and hypertension will all be recorded upon&#xD;
      admission of the patient to the hospital. Hypertension will be defined when a patient is&#xD;
      diagnosed with HT previously to the surgery, receives medical treatment and have systolic /&#xD;
      diastolic BP above 140/90 mmHg upon admission. Patients with normal BP upon admission&#xD;
      receiving treatment for HT will be classified as having regulated HT. Patients with elevated&#xD;
      BP upon admission without previous HT diagnosis will be classified as having newly diagnosed&#xD;
      HT. &quot;Smoking&quot; will de divided into smokers, non-smokers and former smokers. Further on,&#xD;
      average number of cigarettes pr day during the last month will be recorded for current&#xD;
      smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured pharmacological risk variables: Use of statins, bisphosphonates, anticoagulants,&#xD;
      NSAID's and corticosteroids on time of admission will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured surgical risk variables: Surgery time, pneumatic tourniquet time, peroperative blood&#xD;
      loss, postoperative decrease in hemoglobin levels, surgical complications, antibiotic and&#xD;
      bleeding prophylaxis will be recorded by the surgeon upon completion of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Wound-oozing time, length of hospital stay, wound infections, and surgical&#xD;
      revision. Wound will be defined as actively draining if the gauze covering the wound is wet&#xD;
      to the edges or if fluid is noted to be originating from the surgical site. The nursing staff&#xD;
      will record wound drainage during the hospital stay and the patient will be instructed in&#xD;
      self-assessment upon dismissal using patient-diary. Wound drainage will be recorded twice a&#xD;
      day: before- and afternoon. All patients are seen in outpatient clinic for staple removal and&#xD;
      control of the self -assessment drainage-diary 3 weeks after surgery. Time when the wound&#xD;
      appeared dry will be noted. Presence or absence of clinical infection will be noted according&#xD;
      to ASEPSIS criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Multiple linear regression analysis will be performed to model the&#xD;
      effects of the measured risk variables on the time to a dry wound, length of hospital stay&#xD;
      and risk of wound infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: All data collection will be anonymous. Patient consent is not required since&#xD;
      the study involves evaluation of existing data and records and individual subjects can not be&#xD;
      identified either directly or through identifiers linked to the subject. The data collection&#xD;
      will be reported to &quot;Datatilsynet&quot;.&#xD;
