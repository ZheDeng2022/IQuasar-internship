      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of multiple dose omeprazole on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of boceprevir and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the safety of steady state boceprevir combined with multiple dose omeprazole&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that some drugs can significantly influence the bioavailability of other drugs.&#xD;
      For example the proton pump inhibitors decrease the absorption of some protease inhibitors&#xD;
      used in HIV treatment or of some oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors used in oncology. Proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitors increase the pH in the stomach and might therefore decrease the solubility of&#xD;
      other drugs with decreased absorption as a consequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boceprevir (BOC) is an Hepatitis C (HCV) NS3 serine protease inhibitor that has recently&#xD;
      received FDA approval for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. The drug substance is&#xD;
      slightly soluble in water and administration with food increases the oral bioavailability of&#xD;
      BOC relative to the fasted state, by 40% to 60% based on AUC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omeprazole (OME) is the most frequently used proton pump inhibitor. It is the second most&#xD;
      prescribed drug in The Netherlands, with 5 million prescriptions a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OME is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and is known to induce CYP1A2 and inhibit CYP2C19.&#xD;
      BOC is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 and is not metabolised by CYP1A2 or CYP2C19. No&#xD;
      interaction on metabolism of BOC is expected. However, an increase of OME levels may be&#xD;
      expected due to the inhibition of CYP3A4 by BOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As proton pump inhibitors are widely used it is relevant to know if a drug-drug interaction&#xD;
      between proton pump inhibitors and BOC exists which might influence the bioavailability of&#xD;
      BOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine the effect of multiple dose omeprazole on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of boceprevir and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the safety of steady state boceprevir combined with multiple dose omeprazole&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;
