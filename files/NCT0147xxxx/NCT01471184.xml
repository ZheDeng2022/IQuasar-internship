      The primary objective of this study is to assess the relative efficacy of Ectoin® Allergy Eye&#xD;
      Drops and Ectoine® Allergy Nasal Spray compared to placebo, by evaluating Total Nasal Symptom&#xD;
      Score (TNSS) and Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the relative efficacy of Ectoin® Allergy Eye Drops and Ectoin® Allergy Nasal&#xD;
           Spray compared to placebo by evaluating Total Non Nasal Symptom Score (TNNSS),&#xD;
           congestion symptom scores, red eye symptom scores, watery eye symptom scores, itchy eye&#xD;
           symptom scores, and by evaluating the mean cross-sectional area (MCA) using acoustic&#xD;
           rhinometry (AcR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the change from baseline (post-EEC from pre-EEC) in inflammatory parameters of&#xD;
           nasal secretions, comparing Ectoin® Allergy Eye Drops and Ectoin® Allergy Nasal Spray to&#xD;
           placebo at each post-treatment visit.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a clinical history of SAR with seasonal onset and offset of nasal&#xD;
             and ocular allergy symptoms at least during each of the last two ragweed allergy&#xD;
             seasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adults (males and females) aged 18 to 65, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have documentation of a positive skin test within 12 months of screening&#xD;
             to ragweed or a positive skin prick and/or intradermal test for ragweed allergen at&#xD;
             Visit 1. A positive response is defined as a wheal diameter of at least 3 mm larger&#xD;
             than the negative control for the skin prick test or at least 7 mm larger than the&#xD;
             negative control for the intradermal test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Non-pregnant, non-lactating women not of childbearing potential who are&#xD;
             post-menopausal [defined as at least 6 months natural spontaneous amenorrhea], or are&#xD;
             surgically sterile (hysterectomy; bilateral oophorectomy; bilateral tubal ligation&#xD;
             with surgery at least 6 weeks prior to study initiation). Surgical sterility should be&#xD;
             supported with clinical documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Females must have a confirmed absence of pregnancy according to a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test or urine pregnancy test at the times described in Section 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female subjects of child bearing potential must agree to use a reliable and highly&#xD;
             effective method of birth control with a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year)&#xD;
             when used consistently and correctly (e.g. implants, injectables, combined oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence or vasectomised partners) during the&#xD;
             trial, as judged by the investigator. For subjects using a hormonal contraceptive&#xD;
             method, information regarding the product under evaluation and its potential effect on&#xD;
             the contraceptive should be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In generally good health on the basis of medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willingness to attend all study visits.&#xD;

             year is defined as 20 cigarettes/day for 1 year. Smoking must have been stopped more&#xD;
             than 6 months ago&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of lower or upper airway infection in the last four weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinically significant physical findings of nasal anatomical deformities causing&#xD;
             greater than 50% obstruction based on the clinical estimate of the investigator,&#xD;
             including nasal polyps, septal defects or other clinically significant respiratory&#xD;
             tract malformations, nasal piercing, recent nasal biopsy, nasal trauma, or surgery and&#xD;
             atrophic rhinitis or rhinitis medicamentosa within 60 days prior to the Screening&#xD;
             Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or plans to become pregnant or donate gametes (ova or&#xD;
             sperm) for in vitro fertilization during the study period, or for 30 days following&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Use of any of the prohibited medications within the identified exclusion periods (see&#xD;
             Section 3.2.4)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any acute or chronic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect&#xD;
             the study objectives or subject safety (e.g., Diabetes mellitus type I, malignant&#xD;
             neoplasia, chronic renal failure, inflammatory diseases of liver or kidneys,&#xD;
             emphysema, bronchiectasis).&#xD;
&#xD;
