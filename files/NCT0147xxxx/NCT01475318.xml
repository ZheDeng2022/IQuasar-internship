    <textblock>
      By using the combination of mifepristone (anti-progestin), misoprostol (progstanglandin which&#xD;
      stimulates uterine contraction), and letrozole (aromatise inhibitor which reduces estrogen&#xD;
      production), the abortion process will be more effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After mifepristone was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2000,&#xD;
      the combination of mifepristone 200 mg and vaginal use of misoprostol 800 mcg became almost a&#xD;
      standard of care in early medical abortion up to 63 days of gestation. Misoprostol, a&#xD;
      synthetic analogue of naturally occurring prostaglandin E1, has uterotonic effect and it can&#xD;
      stimulate myometrial contraction and cause cervical ripening and dilatation. Progesterone&#xD;
      maintains the uterus in a quiescent state by inducing hyperpolarization of the membrane of&#xD;
      the myometrial cells and a greater change in electric potential is necessary before&#xD;
      contractions can occur. Mifepristone is the anti-progestin that binds to the progesterone&#xD;
      receptors and prevents endogenous progesterone from exerting is effects. It can also increase&#xD;
      the sensitivity of the uterus to prostaglandins. The complete abortion rate achieved with&#xD;
      this sequential regimen has been found to be up to 93-95%, which is higher than the rate&#xD;
      achieved with either mifepristone or misoprostol alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from progesterone, estrogen is another important hormone for the maintenance of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Albrecht et al showed that 50% of the baboons miscarried when maternal estrogen&#xD;
      synthesis was suppressed using aromatase inhibitors whereas all maintained their pregnancy&#xD;
      when concomitant estradiol was given. Letrozole is a third-generation aromatase inhibitor&#xD;
      which leads to reduced production of estrogen and has specific actions at clinical doses with&#xD;
      no effect on basal levels of cortisol and aldosterone. Shi et al found that the combinations&#xD;
      of anti-progestin with aromatase inhibitor act synergistically to induce 100% abortion rate&#xD;
      in rats, with little effect of antiprogestin or aromatase inhibitor when administered alone.&#xD;
      Lee et al conducted the first pilot study of the effect of letrozole on medical abortions of&#xD;
      up to 9 weeks gestation in humans. When 7.5 mg letrozole was combined with 200 mg&#xD;
      mifepristone, the abortion effect was not as great as those observed in animal study, with&#xD;
      clinical complete abortion rate of 71% only. On the other hand, when 7.5 mg letrozole was&#xD;
      given daily for 2 days followed by 800 mcg vaginal misoprostol, this regimen was associated&#xD;
      with a clinical complete abortion rate of 80% and 87.5% with gestation of less than 63 days&#xD;
      and gestation of less than 49 days respectively. Hormonal profiles revealed that letrozole&#xD;
      led to significant reduction in oestradiol level, but progesterone level was not altered. The&#xD;
      complete abortion rate achieved was noted to be higher when the dosage and duration of&#xD;
      letrozole were increased to 10 mg for 3 days. There were no serious complications encountered&#xD;
      in these 200 subjects, implying that these regimens are likely safe to use in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole plays a role in medical termination through its principal effect on oestrodial&#xD;
      synthesis, which is an important factor in the maintenance of early pregnancy. It is&#xD;
      postulated that by combining both letrozole and mifepristone, together with misoprostol, a&#xD;
      synergistic effect will be exerted as the depleted estrogen and progesterone level will be&#xD;
      insufficient to support the pregnancy, and the uterotonic effect of misoprostol will hasten&#xD;
      the abortion process, hence improving the complete abortion rate. The aim of this pilot study&#xD;
      was to determine the complete abortion rate of vaginal misoprostol when given with&#xD;
      mifepristone and letrozole for termination of first trimester pregnancy up to 9 weeks&#xD;
      gestation.&#xD;
