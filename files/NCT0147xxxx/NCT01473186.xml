      Objectives: Given the profound impact of obesity on the genesis of endometrial cancer, this&#xD;
      study proposes to prospectively evaluate the baseline prevalence of menstrual irregularities&#xD;
      and endometrial pathology in morbidly obese women and discover risk stratification markers&#xD;
      that can potentially identify the highest risk women who might benefit from targeted cancer&#xD;
      prevention strategies in a future clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 1: To assess the prevalence of menstrual irregularities and to correlate&#xD;
           gynecologic and menstrual history with the perceived personal risk and severity of&#xD;
           gynecologic cancers in a population of female bariatric surgery candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 2: To determine the prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in&#xD;
           morbidly obese women undergoing bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 3: To obtain adipose, endometrium, and blood samples (before and after)&#xD;
           bariatric surgery to assess baseline hormone levels and adipocyte-derived factors and to&#xD;
           correlate with presence of menstrual irregularities, endometrial hyperplasia or cancer,&#xD;
           and with postsurgical weight changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 1: After informed consent is obtained, a survey and medical history of&#xD;
           prospective bariatric surgery patients will be performed at the University of Virginia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 2: For those women who undergo bariatric surgery, study investigators will&#xD;
           perform endometrial biopsies at the time of bariatric surgery on participants to&#xD;
           determine the status of the endometrial lining and the potential presence of endometrial&#xD;
           cancer and its precursors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 3: At the time of surgery, blood, adipose, and endometrial tissue samples&#xD;
           will collected for evaluation of adipocyte-related factors and correlation with clinical&#xD;
           endpoints. Blood will also be collected at 6 and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results: This study will identify the prevalence and correlation of menstrual&#xD;
      irregularities with endometrial abnormalities and cancer in morbidly obese women as well as&#xD;
      define their perceived risk of developing cancer. Serum biomarkers in obese women with and&#xD;
      without endometrial cancer/precancer would be evaluated for correlation and potential&#xD;
      applicability for endometrial cancer screening in this high-risk population. Most&#xD;
      importantly, this study may provide evidence as to whether screening (via endometrial biopsy&#xD;
      or other serum markers) is warranted in asymptomatic, morbidly obese women and suggest&#xD;
      potential preventive and risk reduction mechanisms.&#xD;

      Obesity is defined qualitatively by the World Health Organization, is &quot;abnormal or excessive&#xD;
      fat accumulation that may impair health. Obesity is now estimated to lead to 280,000 deaths&#xD;
      each year in the U.S., making it the second most common cause of preventable death only&#xD;
      behind tobacco[1]. Obesity leads to an increased risk of several cancers, most notably&#xD;
      endometrial cancer which is the fourth most common U.S. cancer with 40,000 affected women&#xD;
      accounting for 6% of all estimated cancers in 2008 [2]. The recent increase in endometrial&#xD;
      cancer has paralleled the increase in obesity [3]. The relative risk for an obese woman to&#xD;
      develop endometrial cancer increases proportionally with increasing body mass index (BMI -&#xD;
      weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared)[4]. The risk may be 2-3 times&#xD;
      [12,13] or up to 10-times greater for a woman more than 50 pounds overweight [5]. The most&#xD;
      recent cohort study from Norway demonstrated increased adjusted relative risk based on BMI of&#xD;
      4.28 for a BMI of 35-39 and 6.36 for a BMI of 40 or over [6]. Morbidly obese women are also&#xD;
      23 fold more likely to harbor a precancerous endometrial condition compared to normal weight&#xD;
      women [7]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link of obesity with endometrial cancer has been well-established for over 20 years[5,&#xD;
      8]. For the most common histological subtype (endometrioid adenocarcinoma), the development&#xD;
      of endometrial cancer is stimulated by the presence of estrogen. In obese patients, adipose&#xD;
      tissue is responsible for elevating endogenous estrogen levels through its conversion of&#xD;
      androgens to estrogens[9]. This also results in a relative decrease in progesterone, which&#xD;
      normally 'protects' the uterine lining from over-stimulation by estrogen[8]. Obesity impacts&#xD;
      multiple other factors including adiponectin, leptin, insulin, insulin growth factor one&#xD;
      (IGF-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), aromatase, and peroxisome proliferator&#xD;
      activated receptor γ (PPAR) and the potential link of these factors to carcinogenesis has yet&#xD;
      to be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propelled by increasing obesity, there is interest in identifying at risk populations who&#xD;
      might benefit from screening and/or prevention. Viola et al looked at the prevalence of&#xD;
      endometrial cancer and its precursors by biopsying 193 asymptomatic pre- and post-menopausal&#xD;
      obese women (average BMI of 35.5 and 37.6 respectively) and found the prevalence of&#xD;
      endometrial hyperplasia and cancer was 5.8% and 1% in premenopausal women and 12.1% and 3% in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women[10]. These rates may even be higher in symptomatic women. For example,&#xD;
      Schmeler et al evaluated 188 women diagnosed with endometrial cancer before age 50, 61% of&#xD;
      the obese women had reported irregular menses, 14% a history of infertility, and 35% had&#xD;
      diabetes[11]. The advantage to diagnosing endometrial cancer as precursor lesion or an early&#xD;
      stage is due to a dramatic survival benefit; women with stage 1 disease have an excellent 5&#xD;
      year survival rate ranging between 80-95% and survival drops dramatically as stage increases.&#xD;
      Women with earlier-stage disease generally need less-invasive and less-morbid post-operative&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universal screening of all women for endometrial cancer is not currently recommended[12, 13].&#xD;
      However, with the trend of endometrial cancer being found in younger, obese women, there is&#xD;
      an increased likelihood that screening could decrease morbidity and mortality and that&#xD;
      preventative strategies could be implemented in the highest risk women. Kwon and Lu conducted&#xD;
      a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing no screening (standard of care), oral contraceptive&#xD;
      pills as prevention, and endometrial biopsy either yearly or every other year after age 30.&#xD;
      They concluded that the risk of endometrial cancer in a high risk population needed to be 13&#xD;
      times that of the general population to even warrant the use of oral contraceptives as a&#xD;
      preventive measure [13]. Another cost analysis study confirmed that endometrial cancer&#xD;
      screening is not warranted in the general population but that in a high risk population,&#xD;
      annual serum screening might be efficacious and cost effective [12]. To date, there are no&#xD;
      serum screening markers available in endometrial cancer. Prior authors have demonstrated that&#xD;
      low adiponectin levels correlate with an increased rate of endometrial cancer. Adiponectin&#xD;
      activates the AMPK pathway and the PPAR alpha pathway through two different receptors and&#xD;
      functions to increase insulin sensitivity and decrease inflammation. Further prospective&#xD;
      evaluation of adiponectin and other potential biomarkers is warranted in this population and&#xD;
      to correlate with both obesity and weight loss[14-21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that the prevalence of obesity continues to increase while the age at time of diagnosis&#xD;
      of endometrial cancer has also begun to decrease, the early identification of cancer or&#xD;
      pre-cancerous change of the uterus will become an important way to decrease morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in this ever-growing population of obese women[22, 23]. A previous retrospective&#xD;
      study of women undergoing bariatric surgery at UVA demonstrated that endometrial cancer was&#xD;
      one of the most common cancers diagnosed in this morbidly obese population, and that most&#xD;
      women were diagnosed before their bariatric surgery at an average age of 35 and had a BMI of&#xD;
      65 kg/m2 [24]. Yet currently, the pre-operative gynecologic evaluation for bariatric surgery&#xD;
      for weight loss includes only mammogram (to screen for breast cancer) and Pap smear (for&#xD;
      cervical cancer) and compliance with these recommendations has not been well documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the profound impact of obesity on the genesis of endometrial cancer, this study&#xD;
      proposes to prospectively evaluate the baseline prevalence of menstrual irregularities and&#xD;
      endometrial pathology in morbidly obese women presenting for evaluation for bariatric weight&#xD;
      loss surgery. The bariatric surgery population is ideal to define baseline characteristics of&#xD;
      this population, to assess prevalence of endometrial abnormalities and to determine&#xD;
      differences in hormones and adipocyte derived markers in women with and without endometrial&#xD;
      abnormalities and to assess the impact of weight loss on these same markers. Ultimately, this&#xD;
      study may allow the identification risk stratification markers that can potentially identify&#xD;
      women who might benefit from targeted cancer prevention strategies in a future clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
