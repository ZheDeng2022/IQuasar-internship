      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of veliparib that can be&#xD;
      given while a patient is receiving radiation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veliparib is an investigational drug known as a &quot;PARP inhibitor.&quot; Because veliparib affects&#xD;
      the way that cells repair damage, veliparib may be useful in combination with radiation&#xD;
      treatment because it may help make radiation work better. Veliparib is an oral medication&#xD;
      that will be taken twice daily during the 6 weeks a patient is receiving radiation therapy.&#xD;
      The researchers will also be analyzing blood and tissue taken from the skin of patients. The&#xD;
      skin biopsies will help determine which patients are more sensitive to treatment with&#xD;
      radiation combined with the study drug. While the blood sample will allow researchers to see&#xD;
      if the way a person's body processes drugs affects how the patient responds to treatment.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed breast cancer with either a) locoregional recurrence after&#xD;
             previous mastectomy or b) inflammatory breast cancer status post mastectomy for which&#xD;
             radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional nodes is planned as part of treatment.&#xD;
             Patients with Stage IV disease are eligible as long as they meet these criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical resection of disease and willingness to wait at least three weeks after&#xD;
             surgery to begin radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to discontinue any cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             biologic therapy, and targeted therapies (including trastuzumab) at least two weeks&#xD;
             prior to start of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function (assessed within the two weeks prior&#xD;
             to registration and within the month prior to the commencement of protocol treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test (within two weeks prior to registration) if woman has&#xD;
             child-bearing potential (defined as not having undergone surgical methods of&#xD;
             sterilization and having had menses within the past year).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow and retain oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to undergo the three required skin punch biopsies for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy: Prior history of radiation therapy to the chest wall and/or&#xD;
             regional nodes is not allowed (but prior radiation therapy to other sites is&#xD;
             permissible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast reconstruction: Patients who have undergone breast reconstruction procedures&#xD;
             after mastectomy are excluded because of concerns about additional toxicity in this&#xD;
             patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gross residual tumor or positive microscopic margins: Patients with gross residual&#xD;
             tumor or positive microscopic margins will not be eligible because radiation dose in&#xD;
             this study will be limited to 60Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing therapy with other investigational agents: Patients may not be receiving any&#xD;
             other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresolved toxicity from other agents: Patients with unresolved or unstable, CTCAE v4&#xD;
             Grade 3 or greater toxicity from prior administration of another investigational drug&#xD;
             and/or prior anti-cancer treatment are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant comorbidity: Also ineligible are patients with clinically significant and&#xD;
             uncontrolled major cardiac, respiratory, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematologic&#xD;
             or neurological/psychiatric disease or disorder, including but not limited to: active&#xD;
             uncontrolled infection; symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia; any other illness condition(s) that could exacerbate&#xD;
             potential toxicities, confound safety assessments, require excluded therapy for&#xD;
             management, or limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to veliparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant anti-neoplastic treatment is not allowed during protocol treatment and&#xD;
             should be completed at least 2 weeks prior to commencement of protocol treatment, with&#xD;
             resolution of any associated acute toxicities, except that endocrine therapies and&#xD;
             bisphosphonates are permitted without restriction even during protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiation therapy has teratogenic&#xD;
             and abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with veliparib,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued before the patient receives veliparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active seizure disorder or history of seizure, as well as patients with&#xD;
             CNS metastases (unless CNS metastases have been stable after therapy for &gt;3 months and&#xD;
             the patient is not on steroids at the time of study enrollment).&#xD;
