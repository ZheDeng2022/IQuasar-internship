  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation seeks to determine the feasibility of an electronic diary methodology&#xD;
      among pediatric cancer patients and healthy matched controls. Levels of study participation&#xD;
      and compliance will be assessed to assist with determining overall feasibility. Results will&#xD;
      offer insight into the effectiveness of this means of data collection with a pediatric&#xD;
      oncology population, and will examine how psychosocial and contextual factors contribute to&#xD;
      the resiliency that has been demonstrated by children with cancer. Findings will provide data&#xD;
      for the design and implementation of a future, larger-scale study with this pediatric&#xD;
      population that implements an electronic daily diary methodology.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include two phases of participant recruitment and participation. Phase I will&#xD;
      include recruitment of six pediatric patients to pilot an electronic daily diary on an Apple&#xD;
      iPad. These participants will be prompted by the iPad once daily for seven days, and will be&#xD;
      asked to answer multiple choice and yes/no questions related to their daily experiences,&#xD;
      activities and emotions. Following the week of daily diary completion, each participant in&#xD;
      Phase I will engage in a brief feedback interview with a member of the research team to&#xD;
      discuss his/her overall experiences using the electronic diary, including any technological&#xD;
      issues that arise. The purpose of Phase I is to work out any technological and/or logistical&#xD;
      problems associated with completion of the daily iPad diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After any technological problems have been addressed, Phase II of the study will begin. Child&#xD;
      participants in Phase II of the study will complete several paper and pencil questionnaires&#xD;
      on two separate occasions that assess factors including optimism, experience of various&#xD;
      emotions, spirituality, relationships with others, benefit-finding, quality of life, and&#xD;
      resiliency. Children will also complete two weeks of daily electronic diaries that will&#xD;
      prompt them to answer multiple choice and yes/no questions related to their daily&#xD;
      experiences, activities and emotions. One parent or guardian will also be recruited to&#xD;
      participate, and will complete paper and pencil questionnaires on two separate occasions that&#xD;
      ask about optimism, the parent-child relationship, spirituality, psychological functioning,&#xD;
      and their perceptions of their children's behavior and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, following the completion of the first week of daily diaries, a short interview will&#xD;
      be conducted with each child and parent dyad to gather information about the child's&#xD;
      experiences using the electronic diary. They will be asked to provide feedback about any&#xD;
      challenges and technological difficulties that they encountered, as well as their general&#xD;
      thoughts about using the electronic diary. The interview will also include an opportunity to&#xD;
      trouble-shoot difficulties associated with using the electronic daily diary in preparation&#xD;
      for the second week of diary completion. For each participant, we anticipate a participation&#xD;
      timeframe of 10-15 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the usefulness of an electronic daily diary for understanding the&#xD;
           experiences, emotions, and coping strategies of children with cancer and of their&#xD;
           healthy peers.&#xD;

    <description>The proposed investigation is a prospective case-control pilot study. The major goal of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of a daily diary methodology for monitoring the experiences of recently diagnosed pediatric cancer patients and healthy-matched peers. The investigation will also examine the relationships among individual and contextual factors that influence the daily psychosocial functioning of youth with cancer in comparison to youth without cancer.</description>

        All eligible participants will be invited to participate in the research investigation,&#xD;
        including children and parents of both genders and of all races/ethnicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        St. Jude treats pediatric patients from across the country and around the world, which&#xD;
        results in a culturally diverse pediatric population. Based upon enrollment patterns from&#xD;
        previous investigations, it is anticipated that approximately 19% of enrolled pediatric&#xD;
        participants will be racial/ethnic minority children. Because the control group will be&#xD;
        matched to the pediatric group on variables of gender, age, race/ethnicity, and&#xD;
        socioeconomic status, it is anticipated that the gender and race/ethnicity of the control&#xD;
        group will be commensurate with that of the pediatric group.&#xD;
