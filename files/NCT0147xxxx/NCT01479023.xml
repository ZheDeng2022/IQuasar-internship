      2.1 Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the human dosimetry of 64Cu-DOTA-U3-1287 in subjects with advanced solid&#xD;
           tumors (Cohort 1 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To calculate HER3 receptor occupancy (via quantification of the tumor-localized PET&#xD;
           signal produced by 64Cu-DOTA-U3-1287 in the absence and presence of competing unlabeled&#xD;
           U3-1287 in subjects with advanced solid tumors (Cohorts 2 through 5))&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the safety and tolerability of 64Cu-DOTA-U3-1287 (all cohorts)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the relationship between U3-1287 serum concentration and HER3 receptor&#xD;
           occupancy (as measured by PET/CT) in subjects with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the tumor response rate as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
           Tumors (RECIST 1.1) in subjects with advanced solid tumors treated with U3-1287 (Part 2&#xD;
           only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To characterize the PK exposure of U3 1287 when administered intravenously to patients&#xD;
           with advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To measure the rate of anti-U3-1287 human antibody development in subjects with advanced&#xD;
           solid tumors treated with U3 1287 monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess tumor volume changes after U3-1287 treatment by CT or magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging (MRI) (Part 2 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess blood, body fluid/tissue, and tumor specimens for potential biomarkers (e.g.,&#xD;
           proteins and transcripts) that predict response to U3-1287&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To obtain tumor samples for DNA extraction for analysis of potential predictors of&#xD;
           response to U3-1287 and any related genes as suggested by emerging data&#xD;
