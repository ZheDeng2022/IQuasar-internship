  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted as the most common side effect of the HIV drug atazanavir (taken&#xD;
      with ritonavir) is hyperbilirubinaemia. Bilirubin is a normal waste product from the body and&#xD;
      gets broken down in the liver so it can leave the body through the gut. Atazanavir slows the&#xD;
      breakdown of this chemical, which can cause jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and/or scleral&#xD;
      icterus (yellowing of the eyes). This is completely harmless; in fact up to 1 in 10 of the UK&#xD;
      population have an inherited condition that causes the same yellowing. However, some patients&#xD;
      don't like this side effect and it is the commonest reason for switching off the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study in people with Gilberts syndrome (the inherited condition that causes the same&#xD;
      changes in the chemical bilirubin) showed that a mineral supplement (zinc sulphate) reduced&#xD;
      the levels of bilirubin in the blood. The aim of this study is to see if using zinc&#xD;
      supplements can achieve the same effect in patients with high bilirubin due to atazanavir&#xD;
      use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atazanavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) and, like other agents in this class, requires&#xD;
      pharmacological 'boosting' with the cytochrome p450 inhibitor ritonavir. Ritonavir slows the&#xD;
      hepatic clearance of PIs, increasing plasma concentration and allowing the us eof lower, and&#xD;
      less frequent doses. Atazanavir, boosted with ritonavir, is approved for once-daily use, is&#xD;
      an internationally preferred first-line agent (in combination with a backbone of two&#xD;
      nucleosides [NRTI]) and the most commonly prescribed PI in the UK. Once-daily&#xD;
      atazanavir/ritonavir with two NRTI is an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for&#xD;
      people living with HIV infection. The most common adverse event associated with atazanavir&#xD;
      use is unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. This is observed in over 40% of patients and up to&#xD;
      5% of patients discontinue the drug due jaundice and/or scleral icterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Truvada is a fixed dose combination of two NRTI, tenofovir (245mg) and emtricitabine (200mg),&#xD;
      administered as one tablet once daily. Truvada is a preferred NRTI backbone in national and&#xD;
      international guidelines and the first line, therefore most commonly used, NRTI backbone in&#xD;
      our unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of atazanavir/ritonavir compared with alternative agents include once daily dosing,&#xD;
      low pill burden, low rates of gastro-intestinal toxicity and, importantly in a patient&#xD;
      population already at an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, a favourable lipid profile.&#xD;
      If a simple intervention could reduce the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia this could reduce&#xD;
      the risk of treatment discontinuation/switch. The aim of this study is to explore the&#xD;
      benefit, and safety, of adding zinc sulphate in patients on a stable regimen of Truvada,&#xD;
      atazanavir and ritonavir.&#xD;
