    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 81 months for Tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and up to 85 months for Tofacitinib 10 mg BID group that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and all non-serious AEs.</description>

    <description>Remission in participants was defined as a total Mayo score of less than or equals to (&lt;=) 2, with no individual sub score exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding sub score of 0. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis (UC). It consisted of 4 sub scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible sigmoidoscopy and physician global assessment (PGA), each sub score graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicated higher disease severity. These sub scores were summed up to give a total Mayo score range of 0 to 12, where higher score indicated more severe disease.</description>

    <description>IBDQ was a psychometrically validated patient reported outcome (PRO) instrument for measuring the disease-specific quality of life in participants with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis consisted of 32 items scored from 1 (worst response) to 7 (best response). For each domain, higher score indicates better quality of life (QOL). Total IBDQ score was the sum of each item score, and ranged from 32 to 224 with a higher score indicated better QOL.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants enrolled in this Study A3921139: 1) who had completed or had early withdrawal due to treatment failure in Study A3921096 (NCT01458574) 2) or who were non-responders after completing induction studies A3921094 (NCT01465763) or A3921095 (NCT01458951). Eligible participants assigned to either Tofacitinib 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID depending if participant was in remission at baseline of A3921139. Remission=total Mayo score &lt;=2 with no individual sub score &gt;1, rectal bleeding sub score =0.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Treatment failure for Study A3921096 was an increase in Mayo score of &gt;=3 points from baseline value, with an increase in rectal bleeding sub score by &gt;=1 point, and an increase of endoscopic sub score of &gt;=1 point after a minimum of 8 weeks treatment. If endoscopic sub score and baseline endoscopic sub score was 3 (maximum value), then an increase by &gt;=1 point was not needed for treatment failure. But all other components of the treatment failure criteria were needed to be met.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Remission in participants was defined as a total Mayo score of less than or equals to (&lt;=) 2, with no individual sub score exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding sub score of 0. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis (UC). It consisted of 4 sub scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible sigmoidoscopy and physician global assessment (PGA), each sub score graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicated higher disease severity. These sub scores were summed up to give a total Mayo score range of 0 to 12, where higher score indicated more severe disease.</description>

          <description>Remission in participants was defined as a total Mayo score of less than or equals to (&lt;=) 2, with no individual sub score exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding sub score of 0. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis (UC). It consisted of 4 sub scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible sigmoidoscopy and physician global assessment (PGA), each sub score graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicated higher disease severity. These sub scores were summed up to give a total Mayo score range of 0 to 12, where higher score indicated more severe disease.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants in Clinical Remission at Months 2, 12, 24 and 36: Non-responder Imputation- Last Observation Carried Forward (NRI-LOCF)</title>
        <description>Clinical remission in participants was defined as a total Mayo score of &lt;=2 with no individual sub score exceeding 1 point. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 sub scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible sigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicated higher disease severity. These sub scores were summed up to give a total Mayo score range of 0 to 12, where higher score indicated more severe disease.</description>
        <time_frame>Months 2, 12, 24 and 36</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication in this study. NRI method was used for missing data except for visits after a participant advanced to other studies where LOCF method was used.</population>

        <description>PMS was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC without endoscopy. It consisted of 3 sub scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding and PGA, each sub score graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicated higher disease severity. These sub scores were summed up to give a total PMS score range of 0 to 9, where higher score indicated more severe disease. PMS remission was defined as a partial Mayo score &lt;=2 with no individual sub score &gt;1.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication in this study. Here, &quot;Number analyzed&quot; signifies participants evaluable at each specified time point. NRI method was used for missing data at all visits except for visits after a participant advanced to other studies and would reach the visits if the participant stayed in the study where LOCF method was used.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Achieved Mucosal Healing at Months 2, 12, 24 and 36: Observed Cases</title>
        <description>Mucosal healing in participants was defined as Mayo endoscopic sub score of 0 or 1. The Mayo endoscopic sub score consisted of the findings of flexible sigmoidoscopy, graded from 0 to 3 with higher sub scores indicated higher disease severity.</description>
        <time_frame>Months 2, 12, 24 and 36</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication in this study. Here, &quot;Overall Number of Participants Analyzed&quot; signifies number of participants evaluable for this outcome measure and &quot;Number analyzed&quot; signifies participants evaluable at each specified time point.
