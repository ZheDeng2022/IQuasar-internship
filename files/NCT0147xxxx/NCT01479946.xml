  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroporation combined with chemotherapy (ECT) has been shown to be an effective treatment&#xD;
      for breast cancer that has spread to skin. In routine clinical practise, ECT is offered to&#xD;
      patients when all other treatment options have been exhausted. This study tests the&#xD;
      hypothesis that early treatment with ECT may result in improved local control of skin&#xD;
      metastases, improved quality of life and reduced health care costs. Patients are randomised&#xD;
      to either ECT given as early as possible in the course of the disease or delaying ECT for at&#xD;
      least 6 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients &gt; 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological confirmed breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic breast cancer (skin lesions only are considered as metastatic disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior histological confirmation of at least one skin lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Skin lesions must not have a depth greater than 3 cm (measured clinically if possible&#xD;
             otherwise on the basis of CT/ultrasound examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confluent skin metastases where individual lesions are hard to define in their&#xD;
             entirety may not exceed a maximum area of 10 x 10 cm for each area of confluence. If&#xD;
             there are several areas of confluence, the patient may be included in the study&#xD;
             provided that all lesions can be treated within the time constraints of a single ECT&#xD;
             session (20 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not more than ten skin lesions. Each area of confluence is considered as one lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A single skin lesion may not exceed 5 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have received more than one line of systemic treatment (chemotherapy&#xD;
             or endocrine therapy) for metastatic disease following the discovery of skin&#xD;
             metastases. Patients developing skin metastases for the first time during ongoing&#xD;
             systemic therapy may receive one additional line of systemic treatment prior to&#xD;
             inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in the early ECT arm may receive any other cancer treatments at the&#xD;
             discretion of the treating physician starting no earlier than 2 weeks following ECT.&#xD;
             This is to ensure that patients with metastatic disease in other locations will&#xD;
             receive treatment that is considered suitable regardless of their participation in&#xD;
             this trial. (If 2 weeks from ECT to the start of systemic treatment is judged to be&#xD;
             too long by the treating physician, this patient should not be entered into the&#xD;
             trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing age must practice a suitable form of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A life expectancy of at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a ECOG performance status &lt; 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have extensive and rapidly progressive visceral metastases where a delay&#xD;
             in systemic therapy by eventual ECT is judged to not be in the patients' best interest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients, who for medical reasons, cannot be given bleomycin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy who have&#xD;
             progressive disease in the brain two months after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior cumulative dose of bleomycin exceeding 250,000 IU/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 14 days from previous cancer treatment (either local or systemic)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patient has skin lesions that are situated in close proximity to a pacemaker&#xD;
             such that an electrical field from ECT will overlap the pacemaker, the pacemaker must&#xD;
             be moved to another location in order for the patient to be able to participate in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic renal failure (serum creatinine &gt; 150 mol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequate liver function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        ASAT or ALAT &gt; 2.5 x ULN in the absence of liver metastases or &gt; 5 in the presence of liver&#xD;
        metastases or Bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN (except in the case of Gilberts Syndrome) or Albumin &lt; 25&#xD;
        g/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        â€¢ Inadequate bone marrow reserve defined as: White blood cell count &lt; 3 X 109/L or&#xD;
        Neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 X109/L or Platelet count &lt; 100 X 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any severe uncontrolled systemic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable or unwilling to comply with the study protocol&#xD;
