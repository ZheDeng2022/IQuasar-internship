  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RV568 is being developed as a possible treatment of diseases such as smoking related lung&#xD;
      disease (also known as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - COPD) and asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to examine the safety of RV568 in COPD patients. Two dose&#xD;
      strengths of RV568 and a placebo will be tested in this study, which will be given by&#xD;
      inhaling a liquid suspension from a nebuliser once a day for 2 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Severity of Disease: subjects who conform to the current severity classification for&#xD;
             GOLD Stage II/III disease in terms of post-bronchodilator spirometry at screening&#xD;
             (Post-salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of ≤ 0.70 and post-salbutamol FEV1 ≥ 40 % and ≤ 80 %&#xD;
             of predicted normal values calculated using ECCS reference equations)&#xD;
&#xD;
