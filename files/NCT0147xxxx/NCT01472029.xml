      The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of complete pathological responses&#xD;
      (percentage of patients with pCR referring to the total number of enrolled and eligible&#xD;
      patients), as evaluated centrally by a reference pathologist.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of complete pathological responses (percentage of patients with pCR referring to the total number of enrolled and eligible patients), as evaluated centrally by a reference pathologist.</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to surgery after pre-operative treatment (4 cycles = 8 weeks) for 9 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The experimental therapy would be rated as insufficiently active, if the observed pCR rate is 10 % or lower, as this corresponds to the expectations after chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
The experimental therapy would be considered to be a promising candidate for further development (e.g. in a phase III trial), if the true pCR rate amounted to 20% or more.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>R0 resection rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to surgery after pre-operative treatment (4 cycles = 8 weeks) for 9 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The R0 rate is defined as the number of patients with negative surgical margins and no tumor left macroscopically, divided by the total number of recruited eligible patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relapse-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to end of follow up assessed up to 58 months</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse-free survival (RFS) will be defined as the time from enrolment to the time of disease progression or relapse or death, or to the date of last tumor assessment without any such event (censored observation)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to end of follow up assessed up to 58 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall survival (OS) will be determined by measuring the time interval from enrolment to the date of death or last observation, including survival rates after 1, 2 and 3 years.</description>
