  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is safe and feasible to transplant&#xD;
      changed cord blood for patients with leukemia or lymphoma. Researchers also want to learn if&#xD;
      this can help to control the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cord blood will be changed to make use of sugar that is found in small amounts in blood&#xD;
      cells. It plays a role in signaling where in the body the transplanted cells should go to.&#xD;
      Adding more sugars to the cord blood cells in the laboratory is designed to help the cord&#xD;
      blood cells find their way faster to the bone marrow. This may help your blood counts to&#xD;
      recover faster. This process is called fucosylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is a protein that removes immune cells that cause damage to the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clofarabine is designed to interfere with the growth and development of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludarabine is designed to interfere with the DNA (genetic material) of cancer cells, which&#xD;
      may cause the cancer cells to die. This chemotherapy is also designed to block your body's&#xD;
      ability to reject the donor's bone marrow cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melphalan and busulfan are designed to bind to the DNA of cells, which may cause cancer cells&#xD;
      to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus are designed to block the donor cells from growing&#xD;
      and spreading in a way that could cause graft versus host disease (GVHD -- a condition in&#xD;
      which transplanted tissue attacks the recipient's body). This may help to prevent GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab is designed to attach to cancer cells, which may cause them to die.&#xD;

      Central Venous Catheter Placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will first have a central venous catheter (CVC) placed. A CVC is a sterile flexible tube&#xD;
      that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will&#xD;
      explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate&#xD;
      consent form for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy, some of the other drugs in this study, and the cord blood transplant will&#xD;
      be given by vein through your CVC. Blood samples will also be drawn through your CVC. The CVC&#xD;
      will remain in your body for about 2-5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, your doctor will choose one of the following 2 study&#xD;
      plans based on the disease and your age and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludarabine/Clofarabine/Busulfan/Rituximab/Total Body Irradiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are between 1 and 55 years of age and can receive high-dose chemotherapy, or you are&#xD;
      between 55 and 65 years old and your doctor agrees, you will receive fludarabine,&#xD;
      clofarabine, busulfan, ATG, total body irradiation, and possibly rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive a test dose of busulfan by vein over 60 minutes as an outpatient. If the&#xD;
      test dose cannot be given as an outpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -10&#xD;
      for intravenous (IV) fluids and will receive the busulfan test dose on Day -9. This low-level&#xD;
      &quot;test&quot; dose of busulfan is to check how the level of busulfan in your blood changes over&#xD;
      time. This information will be used to decide the next dose needed to reach the target blood&#xD;
      level that matches your body size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 11 samples of blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of busulfan. PK&#xD;
      testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. These blood&#xD;
      samples will be drawn at various timepoints starting before the busulfan infusion and&#xD;
      continuing over about the next 11 hours. The blood samples will be repeated again with the&#xD;
      first day of high-dose busulfan treatment. Each sample will be about 1 teaspoon of blood. A&#xD;
      temporary heparin lock will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks&#xD;
      needed for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for technical&#xD;
      or scheduling reasons, you will receive the standard fixed dose of busulfan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you will receive the test dose as an outpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on&#xD;
      Day -8 and will receive fluids by vein. If appropriate for the disease, you will receive&#xD;
      rituximab by vein over 4-6 hours on Day -8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you will receive the test dose as an inpatient, you will be admitted on Day -10 and will&#xD;
      receive fluids by vein. If appropriate for the disease, you will receive rituximab by vein&#xD;
      over 4-6 hours on Day -10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days -7 through -4, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour, clofarabine by vein&#xD;
      over 1 hour, and busulfan by vein over 3 hours. You will receive ATG on Days -4 and -3. On&#xD;
      Day -3, you will receive a single treatment of low-dose total body irradiation. You will&#xD;
      &quot;rest&quot; (not receive chemotherapy drugs) on Days -2 and -1. Day 0 is the day of the cord blood&#xD;
      transplant, so the negative day numbers are used to label the treatment days before the&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All chemotherapy drugs, fluids, and other drugs that must be given by vein will be infused&#xD;
      through the catheter. Once the back-up cells are collected, all participants will be admitted&#xD;
      to the hospital as indicated by their assigned treatment plan schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludarabine/Melphalan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your doctor chooses fludarabine and melphalan, you will have the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day -6 (6 days before your transplant), you will be admitted to the hospital and will&#xD;
           receive fluids by vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days -5, -4, and -3, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days -4 and -3, you will receive ATG by vein over 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day -2, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 30 minutes and melphalan by vein&#xD;
           over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day -1, you will not receive any drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 0, you will receive your cord blood transplant through the CVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day -3, you will receive mycophenolate mofetil as a tablet by mouth 2 times a&#xD;
      day. If you are not able to take the tablet by mouth, you will receive MMF by vein over 2&#xD;
      hours 2 times a day. If you do not have GVHD at Day 100 after your cord blood transplant, the&#xD;
      dose of MMF will be gradually lowered. If you have GVHD, MMF may be stopped 7 days after the&#xD;
      GVHD is controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day -2, you will receive tacrolimus by vein as a continuous (nonstop) infusion&#xD;
      until you are able to take it by mouth. You will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day&#xD;
      for about 6 months. After that, your tacrolimus dose may be gradually lowered if you do not&#xD;
      have GVHD. Your doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 0, you will receive filgrastim (G-CSF) through a needle under the skin 1 time&#xD;
      a day every day until your white blood count begins to recover. Filgrastim is designed to&#xD;
      help cells in the bone marrow to divide, which helps raise white blood cells counts more&#xD;
      quickly, lower fever, and decrease the risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be checked for possible reactions to the transplant and study drugs, including&#xD;
           GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check for CMV antibodies,&#xD;
           and for genetic tests to learn if the donor's cells have &quot;taken&quot;. The routine blood&#xD;
           tests will be repeated as often as the doctor thinks is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will need to stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks. After you leave the hospital, you&#xD;
      will continue as an outpatient in the hospital area, which means you will have to stay close&#xD;
      enough to be able to come back for any visits for about 100 days after the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for up to 1 year. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if the cord blood is infected and cannot be&#xD;
      transplanted, if you are unable to follow study directions, or if your doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Fucosylation is not an FDA-approved process. It is&#xD;
      currently being used for research purposes only. Fludarabine, busulfan, clofarabine,&#xD;
      melphalan, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and rituximab are FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available to be given to patients with leukemia or lymphoma having a cord blood transplant.&#xD;
      Total body irradiation is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
