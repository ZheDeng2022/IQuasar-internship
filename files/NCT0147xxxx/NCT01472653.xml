    <textblock>
      The therapy of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer will be adjusted to the&#xD;
      grade of skin rush as recorded after the first two cycles of Cetuximab and Cisplatin, i.e.&#xD;
      either with radioimmunotherapy (radiotherapy and Cetuximab) or radiochemotherapy&#xD;
      (radiotherapy and Cisplatin.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: According to literature, the treatment results in irradiated patients who develop&#xD;
      intensive skin reaction after concomitant Cetuximab administration appear improved as&#xD;
      compared to the results of standard combination of radiotherapy and Cisplatin. In other&#xD;
      patients, no beneficial effect of Cetuximab is expected and the therapy with Cisplatin&#xD;
      (concomitantly with irradiation) is more effective in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed single-institution non-randomized phase II study on patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, the therapy will be adjusted to the&#xD;
      grade of skin rush as recorded after the first two cycles of Cetuximab and Cisplatin, i.e.&#xD;
      either with radioimmunotherapy (radiotherapy and Cetuximab) or radiochemotherapy&#xD;
      (radiotherapy and Cisplatin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In the patients with inoperable tumors, induction chemotherapy (Docetaxel 75 mg/m2,&#xD;
      Cisplatin 75 mg/m2, 5-Fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 in continuous infusion days 1-5; repeated every&#xD;
      21 days for 4 cycles) will be administered. In the week before the first fraction of&#xD;
      radiotherapy, all patients will receive a loading dose of Cetuximab (400 mg/m2) and&#xD;
      combination of Cetuximab (250 mg/m2) and Cisplatin (30 mg/m2) during the first week of&#xD;
      irradiation. After multidisciplinary assessment of the grade of skin rush, conducted at the&#xD;
      end of the second week of irradiation, the patients will be grouped as follows: arm A - skin&#xD;
      rush of CTCAE v3.0 grade &lt;2 will proceed with radiochemotherapy with Cisplatin; arm B - skin&#xD;
      rush of CTCAE v3.0 grade &gt;=2 will proceed with radioimmunotherapy with Cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned number of patients included in the study is 120 (arm A - 50, arm B - 70) and&#xD;
      recruitment period is 3 years. The primary objective of the study is to determine&#xD;
      radiologically the complete response rate 12-14 weeks after therapy. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are locoregional control, progression-free survival and overall survival at 2 years after&#xD;
      therapy, acute and late toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The expected complete response rate in patients treated with&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy and those treated with radioimmunotherapy is 50% and 75%, respectively. We&#xD;
      also expect the difference in an absolute survival gain between the groups to be 25%.&#xD;
