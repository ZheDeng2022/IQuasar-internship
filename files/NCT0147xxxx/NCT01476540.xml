    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a challenging, chronic, refractory illness with the highest&#xD;
      mortality rate of any psychiatric condition. Advances in the neuroimaging, genetics and&#xD;
      neurobiology of AN has led to a greater understanding of its underlying pathophysiology,&#xD;
      although few significant advances in treatment have been made in the last half-century. The&#xD;
      central features of AN, which include an intense fear of gaining weight, a refusal to&#xD;
      maintain a normal weight, as well as significant anxiety, anhedonia and dysphoria surrounding&#xD;
      food, have been linked to dysfunction in key brain structures and circuits. Deep Brain&#xD;
      Stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure that involves the insertion of electrodes into&#xD;
      structures believed to drive pathological behavior. The procedure is approved for the&#xD;
      management of movement disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease, and has shown promising early&#xD;
      results in the management of some psychiatric conditions, such as Major Depression. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to explore the safety and initial efficacy of DBS, in patients with&#xD;
      treatment resistant AN.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is a chronic, and debilitating psychiatric disorder associated with the&#xD;
      highest mortality rate of any psychiatric condition. Despite advances in neuroimaging,&#xD;
      genetics, pharmacology and psychosocial interventions in the last half century, little&#xD;
      progress have been made in altering the natural history of the condition or its outcomes. It&#xD;
      has further become increasingly accepted that the thoughts and behaviors at the root of AN&#xD;
      derive from dysfunctional neuroanatomic circuits, whose activity and deviations can be&#xD;
      detected with sophisticated neuroimaging techniques. Much progress has also been made in&#xD;
      mapping the psychology of the illness to underlying neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic&#xD;
      processes that drive and maintain these behaviors, even in the face of severe starvation and&#xD;
      impending death. Dysfunctional reward processing, compulsive hyperactivity, chronic anxiety&#xD;
      and depression, all suggest that AN shares much in common with other conditions, such as OCD,&#xD;
      for which surgical therapy has been tried, and met with success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep Brain Stimulation is a neurosurgical tool that has been widely used for over twenty&#xD;
      years. Most of the experience with DBS comes from the movement disorder literature where&#xD;
      significant success has been had with the management of disabling Parkinson's disease (PD)&#xD;
      and dystonia. The most experience so far has been in Parkinson's disease where well over&#xD;
      50,000 patients globally have received the operation. DBS is believed to work by using small&#xD;
      amounts of electricity to disrupt the activity of brain structures that produce troublesome&#xD;
      symptoms. DBS has also been used in psychiatric patients, both as part of treatment and&#xD;
      research, in cases of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and research, in cases of&#xD;
      Depression. Current research suggests that there are similarities between Anorexia Nervosa&#xD;
      and conditions such as OCD and depression. Given that DBS has shown promise in the treatment&#xD;
      of those conditions, this trial was designed to see if it could be an effective therapy for&#xD;
      Anorexia Nervosa as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would be the first exploration of a surgical therapy for refractory AN. The&#xD;
      rationale stems from clear and robust evidence pointing at a dysfunctional&#xD;
      cortical-subcortical loop driving abnormal behavior, with several important nodes in the loop&#xD;
      being particularly important, and recurring, players. The subgenual cingulate plays a role in&#xD;
      affective decision making, reward processing, as well as subsequent anxiety and dysphoric&#xD;
      mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no brain based, targeted therapies for AN. The scientific significance of&#xD;
      this study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) The first clinical trial exploring deep brain stimulation in an eating disorder population&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) The first demonstration of the influence of deep brain stimulation on dysfunctional&#xD;
      reward processing with co-morbid anxiety/dysphoria&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) The first 'brain-based' treatment for any eating disorder&#xD;
