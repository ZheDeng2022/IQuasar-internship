    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if dasatinib can help prevent breast&#xD;
      cancer from developing in the unaffected breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib is designed to decrease the activity of one or more proteins that are responsible&#xD;
      for the uncontrolled growth of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of leukemia. Its use in breast cancer patients in investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 66 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 60 will be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 3 study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will take dasatinib 40mg once a day by mouth with water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will take dasatinib 80mg once a day by mouth with water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 3, you will not receive dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a study drug diary to complete. In the diary, you will record when you take&#xD;
      the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Month 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be called by a nurse and asked about any drugs you are taking and side effects&#xD;
           you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your drug diary will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Month 2 you will be called by a nurse and asked about any drugs you are taking and side&#xD;
      effects you may be having. You will also be asked to review your drug diary. This call will&#xD;
      take about 20 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Month 3 (or if you leave the study early):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of the breast for biomarker testing.&#xD;
           Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your reaction to the&#xD;
           study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your drug diary will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on study for up to 3 months. You will no longer be able to take the study drug&#xD;
      if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow&#xD;
      study directions.&#xD;

    <description>Change in Ki-67 measured in baseline and month 3 using contralateral breast Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) samples. Samples evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Baseline and follow up Ki-67 values presented in percentage (%) of cell positive, change reflects difference in percentage. Ki-67 is measured as a continuous variable and a one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test comparing the change of Ki-67 of each of the three treated groups with control.</description>
