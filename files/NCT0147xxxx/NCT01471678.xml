      This study aims to determine the relative bioavailability of tamsulosin hydrochloride in a&#xD;
      fixed dose combination capsule of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.5 mg/0.2 mg)&#xD;
      relative to co-administration of dutasteride 0.5 mg capsules and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.2&#xD;
      mg tablets or capsules. Two fixed dose combination capsules will be tested; one will contain&#xD;
      tamsulosin hydrochloride pellets with a 15% enteric coating, and the other tamsulosin&#xD;
      hydrochloride pellets with a 10% enteric coat. In addition, two formulations of tamsulosin&#xD;
      hydrochloride will be tested in the co-administration with dutasteride 0.5 mg; a 0.2 mg oral&#xD;
      disintegrating tablet and a 0.2 mg hard shell capsule. This will be an open-label,&#xD;
      randomized, single dose, four-period crossover in healthy male subjects of North East Asian&#xD;
      ancestry. Subjects will receive single oral doses in four treatment periods, each separated&#xD;
      by a 5-10 day washout period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at&#xD;
      regular intervals after dosing. Safety will be assessed by measurement of blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate and review of adverse events. The study will enrol approximately 30 healthy male&#xD;
      subjects to ensure that 24 complete the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dutasteride (AVODART â„¢) is an approved potent 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor indicated for the&#xD;
      treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate&#xD;
      to improve symptoms, reduce the risk of acute urinary retention and reduce the risk of the&#xD;
      need for BPH-related surgery [AVODART Package Insert, 2009].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, dutasteride is well-tolerated in single doses up to 40mg/day, multiple doses up to&#xD;
      40mg/day administered for 7 days, and 5 mg/day administered for 24 weeks. In single dose&#xD;
      clinical studies, the overall incidence and type of adverse events (AEs) was similar across&#xD;
      the dutasteride, placebo, and finasteride treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tamsulosin (Harnal, Harnal D, Flomax) is an alpha-1-adrenoceptor blocking agent approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Tamsulosin HCl is&#xD;
      extensively metabolized, with less than 10% of the dose excreted in the urine unchanged&#xD;
      [Harnal, 2009; Harnal, 2011; Flomax, 2011]. In human liver microsomes and human&#xD;
      lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP cDNAs in vitro, tamsulosin HCl is metabolized by both&#xD;
      CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 [Matsushima, 1998].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data exist to support that tamsulosin (an alpha-1-adrenoceptor antagonist), when&#xD;
      used in combination with dutasteride (a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor), offers a more effective&#xD;
      treatment for the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia than either drug used alone [GSK&#xD;
      study ARI40005, GlaxoSmithKline document number HM2002/00171/01]. In addition, data from a&#xD;
      large, multi-centre National Institutes of Health-sponsored Medical Therapy of Prostatic&#xD;
      Symptoms (MTOPS) study revealed greater benefits of combination alpha-1-adreoceptor&#xD;
      antagonist and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy compared with either monotherapy in males&#xD;
      with BPH [McConnell, 2002].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical drug interaction studies have shown no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      interactions between dutasteride and tamsulosin. Dutasteride may be administered with or&#xD;
      without food. Tamsulosin should be administered with food. Food effect PK data exists for&#xD;
      co-administration of dutasteride and tamsulosin given in a fixed dose combination (FDC)&#xD;
      capsule formulation relative to the co-administration of the two components, dutasteride and&#xD;
      tamsulosin HCl; GSK studies ARI109882, [GlaxoSmithKline document number ZM2007/00022/00], and&#xD;
      ARI114694, [GlaxoSmithKline document number ZM2010/00028/00]. In the latter study, the dose&#xD;
      of tamsulosin HCl administered was 0.2 mg versus 0.4mg administered in ARI109882. The dose of&#xD;
      dutasteride was the same in both studies (0.5mg). In ARI109882, the GSK combination capsule&#xD;
      was found to be bioequivalent (under both fed and fasted conditions) to the marketed products&#xD;
      administered separately. ARI114694 demonstrated bioequivalence for dutasteride but not for&#xD;
      tamsulosin when administered as an FDC product (of dutasteride 0.5 mg and tamsulosin 0.2 mg)&#xD;
      relative to co-administration of separate commercial formulations of dutasteride (0.5 mg) and&#xD;
      tamsulosin (0.2 mg) in the fed and fasted stage in different North East Asian ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the bioequivalence of tamsulosin only by investigating two&#xD;
      different FDC formulations with 10 % or 15% Enteric Coated Tamsulosin pellets (0.2 mg) and&#xD;
      Dutasteride 0.5 mg relative to co-administration of a commercial formulation of dutasteride&#xD;
      (0.5 mg) and two different commercial formulations of 0.2 mg tamsulosin,Harnal Capsule and&#xD;
      Harnal-D Tablet. Specifically, the study aims to investigate the bioavailability of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FDC (with 10% enteric coated tamsulosin pellets) to a commercial formulation of&#xD;
           dutasteride plus tamsulosin (Harnal-D Tablet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FDC (with 10% enteric coated tamsulosin pellets) to a commercial formulation of&#xD;
           dutasteride plus tamsulosin (Harnal Capsule)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FDC (with 15% enteric coated tamsulosin pellets) to a commercial formulation of&#xD;
           dutasteride plus tamsulosin (Harnal-D Tablet) (also investigated in ARI114694)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FDC (with 15% enteric coated tamsulosin pellets) to a commercial formulation of&#xD;
           dutasteride plus tamsulosin (Harnal Capsule) Both Harnal-D tablets and Harnal capsules&#xD;
           are included as comparators as bioequivalence of the 10 or 15 % FDC formulations to&#xD;
           Harnal Capsules would provide a registration pathway for China, where Harnal Capsules&#xD;
           are commercially available. As Harnal capsules are not available in Korea and Japan,&#xD;
           bioequivalence to Harnal-D tablets would allow the FDC to be registered in China, Korea&#xD;
           and Japan, where Harnal-D tablets are approved.&#xD;
