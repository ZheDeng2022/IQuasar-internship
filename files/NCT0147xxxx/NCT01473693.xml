  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of cancer treatment on the brain.&#xD;
      Some cancer patients report changes in their memory or thinking after treatment. These&#xD;
      changes could be a result of changes in brain structure, such as a change in size or&#xD;
      thickness of different parts of the brain. The investigators will look to see if these&#xD;
      changes in brain structure happen through the results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
      The investigators will do this by looking at the brain structure of lung cancer patients who&#xD;
      have surgery and chemotherapy versus those who have surgery only.&#xD;
