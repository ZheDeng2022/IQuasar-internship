    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and how well giving autologous T cells with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma that is metastatic or&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery. Biological therapies, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy,&#xD;
      may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving autologous&#xD;
      T cells together with cyclophosphamide may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the feasibility, safety and toxicity of treating patients with NY-ESO-1 specific&#xD;
      cellular adoptive immunotherapy in myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) and synovial sarcoma&#xD;
      patients receiving autologous cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ NY-ESO-1 specific T cells&#xD;
      following cyclophosphamide conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the antitumor effect and persistence of adoptively transferred CD8+&#xD;
      antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines following cyclophosphamide conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -3 and -2. Patients receive&#xD;
      NY-ESO-1-specific T cells IV on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 8 weeks.&#xD;

             liposarcoma with metastatic or unresectable disease who have received an alkylating&#xD;
             agent containing regimen (such as doxorubicin plus ifosphamide); this includes&#xD;
             patients who received an alkylating agent as part of adjuvant therapy and then&#xD;

             allowed on the study; &quot;unresectable disease&quot; shall include patients with locally&#xD;
             advanced disease where a surgery could be attempted but where this surgery would be&#xD;
             mutilating, debilitating and would likely fail to result in long-term disease free&#xD;
             survival; in this setting a patient might reasonably choose to undergo salvage/second&#xD;
             line systemic therapy but could also pursue aggressive surgical options as standard of&#xD;

             collected, for whatever reason, will be unable to participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If there is a patient with an NY-ESO-1 expressing sarcoma who would be otherwise&#xD;
             eligible for the trial, where there has been disagreement between pathologists&#xD;
             regarding the histopathologic diagnosis, eligibility will be decided on by the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients must have an echocardiogram (echo) showing ejection fraction (EF) &gt; 50%&#xD;
             and normal troponin and creatine kinase (CK) MB (echo may be done at the time of&#xD;

             metastasis &gt; 1 cm will not be allowed to participate; additionally, patients with five&#xD;
             or more untreated brain metastasis under 1 cm will not be allowed to participate;&#xD;
             treatment may include surgery or stereotactic radiation at the discretion of the&#xD;
             patient's treatment team; patients must be off steroids when starting therapy&#xD;
