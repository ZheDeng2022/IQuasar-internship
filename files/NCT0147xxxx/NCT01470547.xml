  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The portal vein thrombosis (PVT) can complicate medical conditions like liver cirrhosis (LC),&#xD;
      neoplasms, myeloproliferative diseases, thrombophilic genotypes, infections, inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases, trauma and surgery. LC is an important predisposing disease and is responsible for&#xD;
      about 20% of all cases. However, data regarding the PVT in cirrhosis are insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early studies have shown that, in absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the PVT can&#xD;
      occur in approximately 10% of cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of studies are in support of a prevalence between 5 and 20% of patients with LC. A study&#xD;
      in transplant recipients, has documented that in variable etiology cirrhosis, the PVT was&#xD;
      present in 15.7% of patients, a higher percentage was found in patients with liver cancer&#xD;
      (34.8%), while primary biliary cirrhosis (7.9%) and sclerosing cholangitis (3.6%) are less&#xD;
      frequently complicated by PVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PVT development is due to stagnation in the portal circulation, but alterations in the&#xD;
      sense of inherited or acquired pro-coagulant may favor its appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causal association of PVT with bleeding and bowel infarction suggests that the PVT may&#xD;
      reduce survival in cirrhosis, but data are lacking on this issue. It is also not known&#xD;
      whether asymptomatic patients with PVT have a different survival compared to cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients without PVT. Further studies should be conducted to clarify this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, prospective studies are needed to better identify risk factors predisposing to PVT&#xD;
      in LC patients as well as to clarify the relationship between cirrhosis severity and PVT. The&#xD;
      impact of PVT on the natural history of cirrhosis is an issue today still debated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PVT not only favour life-threatening complications (gastrointestinal bleeding and&#xD;
      mesenteric thrombosis) but could also contribute to a deterioration of liver function by&#xD;
      reducing portal flow. Obtaining such information would be of crucial importance considering&#xD;
      that the evidence of increased mortality related to PVT in liver cirrhosis may indicate the&#xD;
      need for randomized controlled trials to clarify the potential effectiveness of anticoagulant&#xD;
      therapy to improve the survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this purpose it's proposed to establish an Italian register of patients with cirrhosis. In&#xD;
      the second phase of the project is planned a 2-years follow-up program in order to assess&#xD;
      whether the PVT be an additional risk factor for mortality or deterioration of the natural&#xD;
      history in patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;

      Study Design: Prospective Longitudinal Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators planned to assess at baseline and at scheduled follow up visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history collection with thrombosis risk factors evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical parameters collection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper abdomen ultrasound and portal district echo color doppler to evaluate the presence&#xD;
           of PVT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood samples collection with plasma and urine storage;&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every follow up visit will be evaluated all relevant clinical events and will be recorded&#xD;
      all treatments received during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: The investigators plan to include in the study n = 1100 patients. The sample&#xD;
      size was calculated assuming an expected prevalence of 18% at time zero, and in order to&#xD;
      obtain a confidence interval 95% to prevail at time zero whose distance from the edge is less&#xD;
      than or equal to 3%.&#xD;
