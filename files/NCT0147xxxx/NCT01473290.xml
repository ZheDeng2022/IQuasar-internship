      RATIONALE: Probiotic therapy may reduce or prevent gastrointestinal complications in patients&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy and pelvic radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well probiotic therapy works in&#xD;
      preventing gastrointestinal complications in patients undergoing chemotherapy and pelvic&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether live freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria probiotic (VSL#3®) is&#xD;
           effective in reducing the acute treatment-related bowel function disturbances, as&#xD;
           measured by the FACIT-D diarrhea subscale score in patients receiving concurrent&#xD;
           chemotherapy and pelvic RT as adjuvant or primary treatment for malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether VSL#3® can reduce chronic treatment-related bowel dysfunction&#xD;
           following completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether VSL#3® appears to have an impact on disease-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To bank blood products for future studies. (exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize changes in the fecal microbiota and examine for correlation with&#xD;
           treatment assignment and symptom scores. (exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are&#xD;
      stratified according to site of primary tumor (rectum/anus vs other), history of anterior&#xD;
      resection of the rectum (yes vs no), total planned cumulative dose (including boost of&#xD;
      external-beam radiotherapy [RT] or brachytherapy) (4,500-5,350 cGy vs &gt; 5,350 cGy), and use&#xD;
      of intensity-modulated RT [IMRT] for pelvic RT (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive live freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria probiotic (VSL#3®) orally&#xD;
           (PO) 3 times a day during RT (5-8 weeks) and for 2 weeks after completion of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo PO 3 times a day during RT (5-8 weeks) and for 2 weeks&#xD;
           after completion of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients self-report symptoms using the FACIT-D, PBFQ, PRO-CTCAE, and Uniscale/fatigue weekly&#xD;
      during RT, for 2 weeks after completion of RT, and at 12 months following the completion of&#xD;
      RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and stool samples may be collected from some patients for correlative studies.&#xD;
