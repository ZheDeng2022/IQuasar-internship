      This is a single-site substudy, &quot;Investigation of the Effect of Cenicriviroc (CVC) plus&#xD;
      Emtricitabine/Tenofovir (FTC/TDF) on Atherosclerosis Risk Factors&quot;, open to all patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the primary study, &quot;A Phase 2b Randomized, Double-Blind, Double-Dummy Trial of&#xD;
      100 or 200 mg Once-Daily Doses of Cenicriviroc (CVC, TBR-652) or Once-Daily EFV, Each With&#xD;
      Open-Label FTC/TDF, in HIV-1-Infected, Antiretroviral Treatment-Naïve, Adult Patients With&#xD;
      Only CCR5-Tropic Virus&quot;, in the San Francisco Bay area to evaluate changes in brachial flow&#xD;
      mediated dilation in patients in one of three treatment groups: 1. Cenicriviroc (CVC) at&#xD;
      100mg (2 tablets, 50mg each) QD + CVC matching placebo (2 tablets) QD + Efavirenz (EFV)&#xD;
      matching placebo (1 capsule) QHS + emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) (1&#xD;
      tablet) QD; 2. CVC at 200mg (4 tablets, 50mg each) QD + EFV matching placebo (1 capsule) QHS&#xD;
      + FTC/TDF (1 tablet) QD; 3. CVC matching placebo (4 tablets) QD + EFV 600 mg (1 capsule) QHS&#xD;
      + FTC/TDF (1 tablet) QD. The substudy will run for the duration of the primary study. 50&#xD;
      patients of the 150 total enrolled in the primary study will be referred to and enrolled in&#xD;
      the cardiovascular substudy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the substudy and substudy protocol staff will be blinded to study&#xD;
      treatment. Data obtained on this substudy will be analyzed in conjunction with laboratory&#xD;
      data for cardiovascular disease risk factors and HIV-1 RNA levels obtained on the primary&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 48-week, comparative study in&#xD;
      approximately 150 HIV-1-infected, treatment-naïve patients with CCR5-tropic virus. Patients&#xD;
      will be stratified by Screening HIV-1 RNA level (≥100,000 copies/mL versus &lt;100,000&#xD;
      copies/mL) and randomized 2:2:1 to one of the three treatment groups. Patients will receive&#xD;
      all medications from the primary study, and thus the primary study site will be responsible&#xD;
      for any adverse outcomes with the drug.&#xD;
