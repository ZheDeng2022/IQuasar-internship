  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the potential for a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction&#xD;
      between INX-08189 and Victrelis, a Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study in thirty-two 18 to 55 year&#xD;
      old, male and female, healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of INX-08189 and INX-08032 when&#xD;
           INX-08189 is dosed alone as compared to when dosed in combination with Victrelis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the PK profile of Victrelis when dosed alone as compared to when dosed&#xD;
           in combination with INX-08189&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the safety of INX-08189 and Victrelis when dosed alone and when dosed in&#xD;
      combination&#xD;
