      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of OCV-501 in patients with AML who&#xD;
      completed the Study 311-10-001 and were judged that there was no relapse by any inspections&#xD;
      in the end of the study.&#xD;

    <description>Bone marrow samples were taken by bone marrow aspiration, and the percentage of bone marrow blasts was calculated. The result was assessed according to the International Working Group Response Evaluation Criteria where a case was designated as relapse if any of the following occurred: reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood or ≥ 5% blasts in the bone marrow after complete response (morphologic relapse).</description>
