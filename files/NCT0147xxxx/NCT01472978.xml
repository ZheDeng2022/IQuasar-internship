  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators found that community acquired C. diff occurs in children undergoing a&#xD;
      colonoscopy. When they were treated their symptoms got better. But, the investigators do not&#xD;
      know if the treatment for the C. diff made them better or another other factor made them feel&#xD;
      better. So, the investigators designed the following study. Children undergoing a colonoscopy&#xD;
      who are found to be C. diff positive at the time of the colonoscopy are randomized to one&#xD;
      group that gets immediate treatment or a second group that gets delayed treatment. Both&#xD;
      groups are closely monitored for symptoms.&#xD;

      Clostridium difficile (CD) is a gram positive, spore forming anaerobic bacillus that is not a&#xD;
      normal commensal of the gastrointestinal tract. It was initially named &quot;difficult&#xD;
      clostridium&quot; because it was difficult to isolate and grow on culture media. CD can exist in&#xD;
      spore and vegetative forms. Outside the colon, it survives in a spore form that is resistant&#xD;
      to heat, acid and antibiotics. In the colon, CD is found in the vegetative, toxin-producing&#xD;
      form and is susceptible to antibiotics. CD is widely distributed and infection is acquired&#xD;
      through the fecal-oral route from person to person contact, although the organism can be&#xD;
      cultured from toilets, bedpans, floors, telephones, shoes of hospital personnel and other&#xD;
      items. CD is most often identified as a disease acquired from medical facilities, but&#xD;
      community-acquired CD (CACD) is also described. CD infection is positively associated with&#xD;
      the use of antibiotics and gastric acid suppressing agents. CD infection is described in&#xD;
      patients who have inflammatory bowel disease and is significantly associated with their need&#xD;
      for hospitalization. Those who are hospitalized for inflammatory bowel disease and CD have&#xD;
      higher mortality and longer hospital stays than patients with inflammatory bowel disease but&#xD;
      no CD infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD is a serious problem among adults. Less is known about CD in children. Although CD was&#xD;
      first identified in newborns, it is not considered a pathogen in children less than one year&#xD;
      of age. In older children CD causes a spectrum of disease similar to that seen in adults but&#xD;
      at a lower rate and with less severity. The epidemiology of CD in children has not been&#xD;
      studied extensively or in a systematic manner. However, intestinal colonization occurs in 5%&#xD;
      of all children older than 2 years of age. Recently, the investigators found colonic&#xD;
      aspirates positive for CD toxin from children at the time of their colonoscopies and in whom&#xD;
      CD was not suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our retrospective chart review of children undergoing colonoscopy from 9/1/2006 through&#xD;
      8/30/2008 identified 41 (17%) CD positive colonic aspirates. There was no difference between&#xD;
      CD positive and negative patients except abdominal pain and weight loss together occurred&#xD;
      significantly more often in the CD positive group. Significantly more CD positive patients (p&#xD;
      = 0.01) used an H2RA within one month of colonoscopy. Too few patient charts contained&#xD;
      information on antibiotic use to determine if a relationship existed with CD. Of the CD&#xD;
      positive patients 5 were lost to follow up, 36 were treated and all except 1 patient had&#xD;
      resolution of symptoms. The investigators concluded that CD infection, likely acquired in the&#xD;
      community, is common in children undergoing a colonoscopy and symptoms cannot be used to&#xD;
      discriminate which children will be positive for CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also cultured patient care sites at Women and Children's Hospital and found&#xD;
      no CD contamination of colonoscopes, medical areas, or supplies was identified. Colonic&#xD;
      aspirates were obtained from 73% of colonoscopies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective chart review had several weaknesses. The most important weakness is that&#xD;
      the study design did not allow us to discriminate between intestinal colonization that occurs&#xD;
      in 5% of all children (15) older than 2 years of age or infection. The study did not permit&#xD;
      an assessment of whether treatment had a significant effect on the symptoms for which the&#xD;
      children presented because there was no control group. The investigators address these&#xD;
      weaknesses in this prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Experimental or Study Design: i. Brief: Double blind crossover study with a control arm.&#xD;
      ii. Detailed: Patients undergoing colonoscopy will be screened at time of initial recruitment&#xD;
      for exclusion criteria. At time of endoscopy a stool aspirate culture (routine) will be&#xD;
      collected. At time of endoscopy patients will be subjected to a second round of exclusion&#xD;
      criteria based on visual findings. Patients with CD (+) stool by aspirate will be randomized&#xD;
      into one of two treatment arms (early, delay). In addition, a third arm of CD (-) age match&#xD;
      controls will also be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e. Sample Size i. A power calculation performed by Chang-Xing Ma PhD. based on an improvement&#xD;
      in symptoms of 1 point between groups on pain scale was performed. Recruiting 25 patients to&#xD;
      each sample group and assuming a 30% drop out rate, final group sample sizes of 17 and 17&#xD;
      achieve 80.7% power to detect a difference of 1.0 between two group means with estimated&#xD;
      group standard deviations of 1.0 and 1.0 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05000&#xD;
      using a two-sided two-sample t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Based on the data from the retrospective review the investigators know that there is a&#xD;
      large amount of variability in this population and expect 1-2 patients enrolled per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f. Variables of Interest i. Subjective: nausea, bloating, ii. Objective: pain, stool&#xD;
      frequency, stool consistency, vomiting, weight loss, antibiotic use, use of acid suppression&#xD;
      iii. Biochemical: stool glutamate dehydrogenase, lactoferrin, CD culture, CD toxin&#xD;
&#xD;
      g. Completion i. Recruitment period: 18 months ii. Completion of therapy after recruitment: 1&#xD;
      month iii. Data analysis: 1 month iv. Total anticipated duration: 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Characteristics of the Research Population&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gender: male/female&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age: age greater than 7 less than 21&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Racial and Ethnic Origen: Any&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Any gender ii. Any race iii. Age between 7-21 iv. Greater then 21 kg v. Able to swallow&#xD;
      pills e. Exclusion Criteria (at time of screening): i. marked abdominal tenderness and&#xD;
      distention with minimal diarrhea ii. history of inflammatory bowel disease iii. fever iv.&#xD;
      systemic toxicity v. allergy to metronidazole vi. short bowel syndrome vii. history of bowel&#xD;
      resection viii. history of abdominal surgery (excluding appendectomy or cholecystectomy) ix.&#xD;
      history of hirschsprungs disease x. active pregnancy xi. inability to participate in phone&#xD;
      surveys xii. inability to maintain scheduled clinic follow up xiii. bloody stools at time of&#xD;
      screening f. Exclusion Criteria (at time of colonoscopy) i. Visual evidence of&#xD;
      pseudomembranes ii. Visible ulcerations iii. Mucosal friability iv. Mayo score greater than 4&#xD;
      v. Fissures/fistulas&#xD;
&#xD;
      g. Vulnerable Subjects- The impact of chronic abdominal pain is noted to have a high&#xD;
      prevalence, strong health care use, and considerable restrictions in the daily life of&#xD;
      children and Adolescents (16, 17). As a result of this disease burden it is prudent to study&#xD;
      this vulnerable population to determine if a biological trigger is present, and if present&#xD;
      how can this trigger be monitored and treated. To protect this population in this&#xD;
      investigation all patients participating under the age of 18 will be required to have both a&#xD;
      parental consent and a participant assent. Patients older than 18 years of age will be&#xD;
      required to have a documented consent. Participation in the project is voluntary and&#xD;
      permission to participate may be withdrawn at any time without risk of changing accepted&#xD;
      standard of care. All tests and procedures are non-invasive, and monetary reward for&#xD;
      completion of study is sufficient to compensate for time and travel costs so not to incur a&#xD;
      financial burden on the family, in addition the monies is not so great as to encourage&#xD;
      participation for the sake of monetary gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Methods and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Recruitment and enrollment methods i. Patients will be recruited from the Department of&#xD;
      Pediatrics, Digestive Disease and Nutrition Center. The patient population of interest does&#xD;
      not necessitate recruitment of patients outside of the normal scope of practice ii.&#xD;
      Enrollment will be voluntary. Eligible patients will be screened at time of clinic visit and&#xD;
      offered the potential opportunity to participate in the study pending the results of routine&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Patients who fulfill inclusion/exclusion criteria at the end of initial screening and&#xD;
      have self identified themselves as interested in participation will be given the opportunity&#xD;
      to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Privacy Protection i. See Section C part e and f.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Research Setting i. Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo and allied clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Summary of Research Design i. See Section A part d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e. Randomization i. Group assignment will be assigned at time of colonoscopy ii. Group&#xD;
      assignment will be in place for those patients assigned to a therapeutic intervention iii.&#xD;
      Random group assignment list by patient enrollment number was generated by Chang-Xang Ma, PhD&#xD;
&#xD;
      f. HIPAA i. The patients &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot; (please see section 6 of application) will&#xD;
      be accompanied by a separate document incorporating Health Insurance Portability and&#xD;
      Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant wording by which patients/parents/legal guardian&#xD;
      authorize the use and disclosure of their Protected Health information by the investigator&#xD;
      and by those persons who need that information for the purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Written Informed Consent will explain that for data verification purposes, study&#xD;
      personnel, a regulatory authority, or an IRB may require direct access to parts of the&#xD;
      hospital or practice records relevant to the study, including patients' medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      g. Data Storage and Confidentiality i. All study data will be securely housed at the&#xD;
      Digestive Disease and Nutrition Center located at 219 Bryant Street ii. All electronic data&#xD;
      is securely housed in Cerner Powerchart monitored by Kaleida Health&#xD;
&#xD;
      h. Payments/compensation i. Patients will be compensated $60.00 at the completion of the&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Data Analysis Plan i. Statistical analysis will be performed by a professional&#xD;
      statistician, Chang-Xang Ma, PhD, at the University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY. Comparisons&#xD;
      treatment 1 and treatment 2 groups will be performed by SAS statistical software using chi&#xD;
      square, Fisher's exact tests, t-test and multivariate analysis as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Risks and Potential Benefits of Participation in the Research a. Subject Risk i. The risk&#xD;
      to subjects for the initial colonoscopy is no greater than the standard risk. The potential&#xD;
      risk attributable to home stool collection includes contamination of food, and spread of&#xD;
      fecal oral organisms if appropriate hand washing is not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Subject potential benefit i. The potential benefit to patients is resolution of abdominal&#xD;
      pain symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Informed Consent Process (Consent/Permission/Assent)&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. The principal investigator will ensure that the patient's parent/guardian is given full&#xD;
      and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and&#xD;
      benefit of the study. As all patients will be greater than assent age, assent will be&#xD;
      obtained for all children enrolled in the study. Patients and the patient's parent/guardian&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient/guardian's signed and dated informed consent as well as the patient's assent will&#xD;
      be obtained before conducting any procedure or test specifically for the study.&#xD;
