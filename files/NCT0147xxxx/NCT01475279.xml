  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effect of Dantonic on the steady-state&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic of warfarin in healthy subjects and safety of the&#xD;
      co-administration of Dantonic and warfarin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to a large proportion of patients that could benefit from Dantonic treatment is likely to&#xD;
      take warfarin concomitantly. And there is no systematic experience of warfarin drug-drug&#xD;
      interaction between Dantonic and warfarin on humans. It is highly relevant to investigate the&#xD;
      potential interaction of theses two drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •The change in INR with T89 (Day 25) compared with that without T89 (Day 18)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change in PK variables for R-warfarin and S-warfarin on Day 17 compared with those&#xD;
           on Day 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety assessments across all time points&#xD;
