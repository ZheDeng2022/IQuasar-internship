      Sternal osteomyelitis and poststernotomy mediastinitis is a severe and life-treating&#xD;
      complication after the cardiac surgery. The incidence of sternal osteomyelitis ranges from 1%&#xD;
      to 3% with a high mortality rate from 19% to 29% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most devastating complication of the open sternum is the laceration of the right&#xD;
      ventricle which has a very high mortality. Additionally destabilizations of the thoracic&#xD;
      cage, prolonged immobilization, or substantial surgical trauma are further complications of&#xD;
      the conventional strategy (4). In addition, postoperative infections after sternotomy are&#xD;
      associated with prolonged hospital stay, increased healthcare costs and impaired quality of&#xD;
      patient life, representing an economic and social burden. The emergence of increasing&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistant bacteria augments the importance of postsurgical infections since the&#xD;
      antimicrobial choices are becoming limited. Furthermore, the incidence of infection is an&#xD;
      indicator for the quality of patient care in the international benchmark studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several therapy strategies are nowadays present in clinical practice, there is a&#xD;
      lack of evidence based surgical consensus for treatment of this surgical complication. In&#xD;
      most case the poststernotomy mediastinitis is involving surgical revision with debridement,&#xD;
      open dressing and/or vacuum assisted therapy. After the granulation tissue on open chest&#xD;
      wound was achieved secondary closure and/or reconstruction with vascularized soft tissue&#xD;
      flaps such as omentum or pectoral muscle is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems there is a need for more effective surgical treatment of poststernotomy wound&#xD;
      infections, which may address the prolonged hospitalization and reduce number of surgical&#xD;
      interventions and with this also perioperative morbidity. In light of this we propose a&#xD;
      randomized study comparing new delay primary closure of the sternum to the secondary vacuum&#xD;
      assisted closure.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Problem of surgical site infection after sternotomy Sternal osteomyelitis and&#xD;
           poststernotomy mediastinitis is a severe and life-treating complication after the&#xD;
           cardiac surgery. The incidence of sternal osteomyelitis ranges from 1% to 3% (1, 2) with&#xD;
           a high mortality rate from 19% to 29% (1, 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The most devastating complication of the open sternum is the laceration of the right&#xD;
           ventricle which has a very high mortality. Additionally destabilizations of the thoracic&#xD;
           cage, prolonged immobilization, or substantial surgical trauma are further complications&#xD;
           of the conventional strategy (4). In addition, postoperative infections after sternotomy&#xD;
           are associated with prolonged hospital stay, increased healthcare costs and impaired&#xD;
           quality of patient life, representing an economic and social burden. The emergence of&#xD;
           increasing antimicrobial resistant bacteria augments the importance of postsurgical&#xD;
           infections since the antimicrobial choices are becoming limited. Furthermore, the&#xD;
           incidence of infection is an indicator for the quality of patient care in the&#xD;
           international benchmark studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although several therapy strategies are nowadays there is a lack of evidence based&#xD;
           surgical consensus for treatment of this surgical complication. In most case the&#xD;
           poststernotomy mediastinitis is involving surgical revision with debridement, open&#xD;
           dressing, vacuum assisted therapy or closed irrigation. After the granulation tissue on&#xD;
           open chest wound was achieved secondary closure and/or reconstruction with vascularized&#xD;
           soft tissue flaps such as omentum or pectoral muscle is performed. Both open therapy and&#xD;
           the flap implantations may be used as a single-line therapy or as a combination of&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Etiology of poststernotomy infections Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain&#xD;
           the development of sternal wound infection. These theories include inadequate sternal&#xD;
           fixation leading to instability and dehiscence of the overlying skin incision and&#xD;
           inadequate surgical drainage. Further theories suggest a localized ischemic&#xD;
           osteomyelitis. This theory suggests that sternal wires become loose, leading to sternal&#xD;
           instability, which ultimately leads to skin dehiscence and osteomyelitic infection. The&#xD;
           most commonly cultured organism is Staphylococcus Aureus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several retrospective and prospective studies have identified factors relating to&#xD;
           increasing risk of sternal dehiscence. Patient risk factors include obesity, diabetes&#xD;
           mellitus, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), chronic cough from tobacco abuse,&#xD;
           steroid therapy, hypertension, immunosuppression, and advanced age. Operative risk&#xD;
           factors include single or bilateral internal mammary artery (IMA) harvesting&#xD;
           (significantly decreases blood supply to ipsilateral hemithorax), prolonged operation,&#xD;
           excessive hemorrhage, reoperation, break in sterile technique, and the use of an&#xD;
           intra-aortic balloon pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Study hypothesis The optimal treatment of sternum osteomyelitis has not yet been&#xD;
      defined. The aim of this randomized study is to compare the treatment outcome of the delayed&#xD;
      primary closure with short-term VAC-therapy (48-72 h) with the late secondary closure with&#xD;
      long-term VAC therapy (&gt;14 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the delayed primary closure will have a better outcome than late&#xD;
      secondary closure regarding parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cure rate (&gt;80% versus &lt;60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospitalization (≤6 weeks versus &gt;6 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of surgical interventions (≤4 versus &gt;5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-hospital mortality (5 versus 15%) This combined surgical and active approach has an&#xD;
           economic advantage compared to the conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Aims Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the treatment outcome (hospital stay, morbidity, mortality and surgical&#xD;
           stress load) of the delayed primary closure approach with the late secondary closure&#xD;
           Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate side effects of both treatment approaches, and treatment expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1. Ethical aspects The permission from the local Ethical Committee will be obtained&#xD;
           before beginning the study. This study will be also registered with&#xD;
           www.ClinicalTrials.gov. Patients will be enrolled before randomization 1:1 into each&#xD;
           study arm; in each group we will randomly include 40 patients. The randomization is not&#xD;
           blind and will be performed by one of the principal investigators. In absence of the&#xD;
           principal investigators this may be performed by co-investigators. Surgical procedures&#xD;
           in both arms should be standardized. In this way is essential that all the interventions&#xD;
           will be performed by main investigator and the co-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Arm A) In this group the patients will be treated with the standard surgical treatment.&#xD;
           In details the procedure is described under 4.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Arm B) I s the group the patients are treated according to the new concept of the&#xD;
           delayed primary sternal closure. The procedure id described under 4.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Procedures and methods 4.1. Definition of the sternal infection Median sternotomy wound&#xD;
           complications vary from sterile wound dehiscence to suppurative mediastinitis. Sternal&#xD;
           bone infection, mediastinitis, wound complication, and wound infection have been used&#xD;
           synonymously to denote deep sternal wound infection. For the sake of consistency in&#xD;
           comparing data from various reports, definitions of sternal wound complications are as&#xD;
           follows (8,9,10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad 1) Mediastinal dehiscence: median sternotomy wound breakdown in the absence of clinical or&#xD;
      microbiologic evidence of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad 2) Mediastinal wound infection: clinical or microbiologic evidence of infected presternal&#xD;
      tissue and sternal osteomyelitis, with or without mediastinal sepsis and with or without&#xD;
      unstable sternum. Subtypes include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) superficial wound infection: wound infection confined to the subcutaneous tissue B) deep&#xD;
      wound infection (mediastinitis): wound infection associated with sternal osteomyelitis with&#xD;
      or without infected retrosternal space. Deep sternal wound infections, or mediastinitis, is&#xD;
      classified into four subtypes based on the time of first presentation, the presence or&#xD;
      absence of risk factors, and whether previous attempts at treating the condition have failed&#xD;
      (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sternal wound infection will be considered:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of mediastinitis has been established by the Center for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention in the USA (11). According to these guidelines, diagnosis of mediastinitis&#xD;
      requires at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad 1) an organism isolated from culture of mediastinal tissue or fluid; Ad 2) evidence of&#xD;
      mediastinitis seen during operation; Ad 3) one of the following conditions: chest pain,&#xD;
      sternal instability, or fever (&gt;38 8C), in combination with either purulent discharge from&#xD;
      the mediastinum or an organism isolated from blood culture or culture of mediastinal&#xD;
      drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2. Outline of the surgical procedures Patients with suspected sternal osteomyelitis will be&#xD;
      hospitalized and the following diagnostic procedures will be performed: laboratory blood&#xD;
      tests (leukocytes, CRP, creatinin, AST, ALT, CK), computed tomography (CT) of the sternum,&#xD;
      wound swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the diagnosis is secured the patients will receive an information consent form of the&#xD;
      study. Subsequently they will be randomly included in one of the surgical arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3. Current treatment strategy of poststernotomy infections During the past years,&#xD;
      vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) wound therapy has emerged as a treatment for open septic&#xD;
      wounds. It is a non-invasive system that helps promote wound healing by delivering negative&#xD;
      pressure the application of this subatmospheric form of treatment has, several advantageous&#xD;
      as compared to the conventional treatment. VAC therapy allows open drainage that continuously&#xD;
      absorbs exudate with simultaneous stabilization of the chest and isolation of the wound. This&#xD;
      therapy induces the building of the granulation tissue which in majority is a result of the&#xD;
      reduced oedema and increased blood flow in the adjacent tissue. Furthermore, VAC therapy&#xD;
      approximates the wound edges and provides a mass filling effect with a low degree of surgical&#xD;
      trauma, without establishing a new wound (e.g., abdominal wound in omental flaps) (5,6). In&#xD;
      the recent literature the mean hospitalization of the patients being treated with the VAC&#xD;
      therapy was 25 ± 20 days with overall mortality of 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4. Arm A) Secondary closure with the vacuum-assisted system (VAC) Nowadays after the&#xD;
      diagnosis of the poststernotomy wound infection is established the clinical procedure is&#xD;
      obtained as follows: firstly the empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin is induced. The&#xD;
      lab samples including bacteriology test are obtained. The initial surgical revision is done&#xD;
      within 24 hours. Intraoperatively from the surgical field again tissue samples are sent for&#xD;
      bacteriology investigation to determine the antibiotic pattern resistance. All sternal wires&#xD;
      are removed. Surgical debridement is made until occurrence of tissue bleeding. Careful and&#xD;
      extensive cleaning of the wound is performed using saline solution at 37°C degrees Celsius&#xD;
      and the solution of 50% betadine and saline solution (1:1 Betadine:H20). Finally VAC sponge&#xD;
      is implanted with negative suction pressure of 75 mmHg. Postoperatively chest X-ray is&#xD;
      obtained, in the first 24 hours the lab samples with CRP and whit blood cell count is&#xD;
      performed. The first revision with second look and debridement is usually made in 48 hours.&#xD;
      Subsequently in the following days the wound is stepwise revised during VAC changes (every&#xD;
      48/72 hours) a sharp spoon and necrotic bone is removed when necessary, but extensive&#xD;
      sternectomy is avoided. At each revision tissue samples are obtained for microbiological&#xD;
      investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the patients general situation they are extubated immediately after VAC therapy&#xD;
      initiation and are staying on the intensive care unit for about 24 hours. The patients are&#xD;
      obtained 5 to 7 times to the surgical procedures in time intervals of 48/72 hours.&#xD;
      Subsequently when the last three bacteriology samples are negative a delayed primary closure&#xD;
      by usage of Kryptonite biocompatible adhesive glue (Doctors Research Group Inc, Southbury,&#xD;
      CT)- if needed for sternal stabilization- or rectus abdominal muscle flap may be done. As far&#xD;
      the antibiogram is known, the specific antibiotic therapy is induced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5. Arm B) Surgical procedure by delayed primary closure As compared to the previous therapy&#xD;
      modalities mentioned under 2.2 and 1.3 the new method has an advantage of the surgical wound&#xD;
      healing by delayed primary intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first step, after the diagnosis of the infection was done, and the empiric antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy is induced with vancomycin in the first surgical intervention the sternal wires will&#xD;
      be removed, the mediastinum is explored and extensive surgical debridement is performed until&#xD;
      occurrence of tissue bleeding. Careful and extensive cleaning of the wound was performed&#xD;
      using saline solution at 37°C degrees Celsius and the solution of 50% betadine and saline&#xD;
      solution (1:1 Betadine:H20), at least 3 samples (tissue biopsies) are taken for microbiology.&#xD;
      The patients will receive treatment delivered through the VAC system in the first 48 hours&#xD;
      following the first surgical intervention. Subsequently the wound is closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We begin with dissection and elevation of the pectoralis major muscle and corresponding&#xD;
      subcutaneous flap through diathermy. Dissection is performed from the median line along the&#xD;
      costal grid, up to two thirds of the anterior chest wall, preserving the humeral insertion,&#xD;
      thoracoacromial vascular bundle and pectoralis minor muscle. Note at this area are very&#xD;
      important vascular connections areas between the internal thoracic artery, acromial artery&#xD;
      and the lateral thoracic artery which should be preserved. At inferior plane, the pectoralis&#xD;
      major muscle will be raised - including the anterior rectus fascia - and down up to the&#xD;
      xiphoid process. The upper segment of the anterior rectum will be raised with the pectoralis&#xD;
      major muscle. The intercostal perforating arterial branches will be preserved also. A silicon&#xD;
      drain tube is placed in the retrosternal space if this is possible. In patients with fracture&#xD;
      or asymmetry of the sternum incision, osteosynthesis is performed using the &quot;Robiscek&quot;&#xD;
      technique. Then two suction drains were placed below the muscular plane upon the costal grid&#xD;
      for drainage of the large area of detachment of the musculoaponeurotic layer The suture of&#xD;
      the pectoral fascia should be tension free, continuous suture with resorbable material&#xD;
      (Vicryl 3-0). The subcutaneous tissue is closed over the drainage, with separate subcutaneous&#xD;
      suture. The skin is closed with non-resorbable suture analog to the &quot;Allgöver&quot; suture. These&#xD;
      sutures are removed between the 12 and 14 postoperative days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the results of the bacteriology are known in most cases after the first 48 hours the&#xD;
      specific antibiotic therapy, according to the results of the bacteriology results may be&#xD;
      introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6 General considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraindication for closure of the chest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wounds with active purulence require extensive debridement prior to flap coverage and/or&#xD;
      rigid fixation. Additional contraindications for sternal reconstruction are found in patients&#xD;
      who are unstable for surgery, including those with poor pulmonary function, poor cardiac&#xD;
      reserve, or terminal illness. Hemodynamic stability is required for surgical intervention in&#xD;
      patients with sternal dehiscence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.7. Early perioperative management in the 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfer to the ICU:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each definitive sternal closure the patients will be transferred to the ICU for the&#xD;
      hemodynamical observation in the first 24 hours. Beside the followings are considered as&#xD;
      indications to transfer on ICU.:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative sepsis, intraoperative hemodynamical instability or/and need for catecholamines,&#xD;
      intraoperative need for massive transfusion, rupture of the ventricular cavities (left or&#xD;
      right), need for emergency cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfer to the intermediate car Hemodynamical and pulmonary stable patients will be&#xD;
      extubated in the operating room, and will be transferred to the intermediate care unit of the&#xD;
      department of cardiovascular surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General considerations Independently in both investigation groups Arm A) and Arm B)&#xD;
      postoperatively X-ray of the thorax will be obtained after the transfer. In the first 24&#xD;
      hours, the lab samples will be obtained (CRP, anticoagulation, white blood cell cont,&#xD;
      hemoglobin, hematocrit, ASAT, ALAT, yGT, Creatinine, Urea, and anticoagulation tests PTT,&#xD;
      TP). Respiratory physiotherapy will be obtained 24 hours after the surgical revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open chest patients should not be mobilized out of the bed, however the chest elevation and&#xD;
      mobilization of 45 to 90° is aloud.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After definitive closure of the chest the patient may be fully mobilized after the first 48&#xD;
      hours, or after the transfer to the ward.&#xD;
