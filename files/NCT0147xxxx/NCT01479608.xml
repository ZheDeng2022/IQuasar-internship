  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal liver metastases (CLM) are currently considered an absolute contraindication for&#xD;
      liver transplantation (Lt) although Lt for other primary and secondary liver malignancies&#xD;
      show excellent outcome in selected patients. Before 1995, several Lts for CLM were performed,&#xD;
      but the outcome was poor (18% 5-year survival) and Lt for CLM was stopped. Since then,&#xD;
      several advances have been achieved and survival following Lt has improved by almost 30%.&#xD;
      Thus, a 5-year survival of about 50% following Lt for CLM could be anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously included 21 patients in a pilot study. All patients had&#xD;
      advanced CLM at the time of Lt. Long term overall survival (OS) exceeds by far previously&#xD;
      reported outcome for this patient group and is comparable or better than survival following&#xD;
      repeat Lt for non-malignant diagnoses. Development of robust selection criteria may further&#xD;
      improve the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to explore whether liver&#xD;
      transplantation in selected patients with liver metastases from CRC can obtain significant&#xD;
      life extension and better health related quality of life compared to patients receiving&#xD;
      surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also explore if patient selection according to nomo-grams for outcome&#xD;
      of colorectal cancer can define a subgroup of patients with a 5 year survival of at least 50%&#xD;
      or even cure from the disease.&#xD;
