  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information from VISN 19 Denver VA mental health&#xD;
      professionals regarding their perspectives of necessary resources to provide best practice&#xD;
      mental health service to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/ Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)&#xD;
      Veterans. Specifically, this study aims to describe provider perspectives regarding the&#xD;
      following: a) clinical needs of OIF/OEF Veterans; b) collaboration and referral processes; c)&#xD;
      barriers to providing optimal treatment to this cohort d) provider needs and resources that&#xD;
      may improve service delivery to this cohort; e) provider perspectives regarding psychiatric&#xD;
      outcomes in this cohort; and f) professional satisfaction. Support for this study is provided&#xD;
      by previous research evaluating Veteran's Administration (VA) needs to provide service to&#xD;
      OIF/OEF Veterans (Sayer, et al. 2009; Friedmann-Sanchez, et al. 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above information will be obtained using semi-structured interview. Hypotheses are not&#xD;
      provided as this is an exploratory qualitative study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No hypotheses are associated with this study as this is a qualitative study wherein subjects&#xD;
      will participate in a semi-structured interview developed specifically for this study, which&#xD;
      serves as the outcome measure. Up to 30 providers will be interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Interviews will be transcribed in their entirety and de-identified. Dr.&#xD;
      Signoracci and 4 additional MRIECC researchers will independently code each interview for&#xD;
      themes. Finally, group meetings with Dr. Signoracci and MIRECC researchers will be held in&#xD;
      order to achieve larger consensus regarding such unique and universal themes (Rubin &amp; Rubin,&#xD;
      1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any reporting of information regarding: a) length of time employed at Denver VA; b) length of&#xD;
      time employed within VA system; c) provider professional title; d) provider degree; f)&#xD;
      professional licenses held; g) clinic/service in which provide services will be done in the&#xD;
      aggregate, across clinics. No individual data will be reported with respect to these items.&#xD;
      Also, any selected quotes that are reported will remain de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analyses will not be conducted because no hypothesis quantitative testing is being&#xD;
      done, and therefore there are no parameters to estimate. With qualitative designs one&#xD;
      conducts interviews until reaching the saturation point. In other words, subsequent&#xD;
      interviews do not yield any new information (Rubin &amp; Rubin, 1995). Previous experience&#xD;
      (Brenner et al., 2008) suggests that 25 completed interviews should provide a wide enough&#xD;
      range of responses for important themes to emerge.&#xD;
