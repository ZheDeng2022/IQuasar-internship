    <textblock>
      This study is a phase IV clinical trial with the objective of evaluating whether pain relief&#xD;
      associated with pregabalin for at-level non-evoked and evoked neuropathic pain is more&#xD;
      efficient during the early rather than late subacute phase of spinal cord injury.&#xD;
