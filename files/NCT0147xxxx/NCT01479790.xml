  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a common condition that affects vision and quality of life in patients. Dry eye&#xD;
      clinical research is limited to follow up of disease progression. Currently, most research&#xD;
      outcomes are based on subjective patient complaints rather than objective assessment of the&#xD;
      condition. Only few objective measurements for dry eye are available today and this is mainly&#xD;
      the result of poor repeatability and inaccuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study aims to evaluate 2 new non-invasive imaging techniques suitable for dry&#xD;
      eye assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is an imaging device that has the&#xD;
      ability to image the tear meniscus of the eye in a safe and non-invasive manner. Image&#xD;
      analysis can then indirectly determine the tear film volume. Improvements in the image&#xD;
      resolution of these devices require a study that compares the repeatability and agreement of&#xD;
      an older (Visante AS-OCT) and a newer instrument (Cirrus AS-OCT) which the current study aims&#xD;
      to address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another method of evaluating dry eye disease is a novel technique that uses functional&#xD;
      infrared thermography to measure tear evaporation rate. This study will also establish&#xD;
      repeatability of measurements of the ocular surface temperature which are used to calculate&#xD;
      tear evaporation rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should these methods are found to be repeatable, they can be used in future clinical trials&#xD;
      as an additional tool to investigate dry eye treatments.&#xD;

      Study Objectives and Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A - AS-OCT repeatability and agreement&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary purpose of Part A is to compare the repeatability of the Cirrus with the&#xD;
           Visante AS-OCT imaging system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second objective is to identify the level of agreement in the tear meniscus&#xD;
           measurements taken by the Cirrus and Visante AS-OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - Tear evaporimetry with functional infra-red thermography&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the repeatability of Infrared thermography for ocular surface temperature&#xD;
           measurements that are used for calculation of tear evaporation rates. If this is found&#xD;
           to be acceptable, it will be correlated to tear meniscus parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether this method is able to detect temperature changes of the ocular&#xD;
           surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A. Cross sectional study. Part B. Prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A - AS-OCT repeatability and agreement Repeatability is an important issue in the&#xD;
      objective assessment of dry eye. While previous studies have compared various methods of&#xD;
      measuring the tear meniscus, including the use of Visante AS-OCT, current literature lacks&#xD;
      studies that investigated the Cirrus AS-OCT for assessment of dry eye. With a higher&#xD;
      resolution, the Cirrus is potentially useful as a non-invasive procedure for objective&#xD;
      measurements of the tear meniscus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - Tear evaporimetry with functional infra-red thermography Current available methods&#xD;
      to measure of tear evaporation rate have major limitations. This new method, however, is&#xD;
      non-invasive, has no need for special eye drops or chambers and takes temperature&#xD;
      measurements very quickly. This method is therefore extremely practical and provides many&#xD;
      exciting possibilities for future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and target sample size 40 volunteers from Singapore Eye Research Institute will&#xD;
      be recruited for this study. Each volunteer will be given a study serial number to ensure&#xD;
      anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 will participate in the AS-OCT study. 20 will participate in the tear evaporimetry study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A - AS-OCT repeatability and agreement Two AS-OCT imaging systems, namely Cirrus and the&#xD;
      Visante, will be tested. All participants undergo acquisition of 2 images by the Visante&#xD;
      AS-OCT, then 2 images by the Cirrus AS-OCT. Both images will be acquired by the same&#xD;
      technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - Tear evaporimetry with functional infra-red thermography In total, four pairs of&#xD;
      thermographic sequences on the ocluar surface temperature from volunteers will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The volunteer will be seated in front of the thermographic camera and on each eye on&#xD;
           thermographic sequence will be captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After 20 minutes, a second pair of thermographic sequences will be captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An eye mask with a temperature of not more than 40 deg C (confirmed by thermometer) will&#xD;
           be worn by the volunteer for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A third pair of thermographic sequences will be captured immediately after mask removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A fourth pair of thermographic sequences will be captured 1 hour after mask removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between sequence acquisitions, the volunteer is allowed to move freely in the room. The&#xD;
      temperature and humidity of the room will be kept constant during measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit schedules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one examination per ASOCT instrument for Part A is required. For Part B, all&#xD;
      thermography will be performed on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants agree to have both ASOCT and tear evaporimetry done, then they will undergo&#xD;
      Parts A and B. If not, they will be recruited for either Part A or Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: 1 day&#xD;
