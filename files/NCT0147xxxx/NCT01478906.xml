      The current study is designed to investigate the difference of plasma orexin A levels between&#xD;
      elderly and young patients at emergence from sevoflurane-fentanyl anesthesia who will undergo&#xD;
      elective lumbar surgery.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:A specific group of neurons in the brain produces hypocretin, also called orexin,&#xD;
      a peptide which has been established as an important regulator of anesthesia and emergence in&#xD;
      the latest few years. In the animal experiment,we found that the level of orexin A in aged&#xD;
      rats was higher when compared with that of the young ones. Whereas the numbers of both the&#xD;
      orexin receptor 1 and 2 in aged rats decreased. We wonder if there is a similar phenomenon in&#xD;
      human beings which might account for the difference between the intervals of elderly and&#xD;
      young patients recovering from anesthesia. This study aims to investigate difference of&#xD;
      plasma orexin A levels between elderly patients and young at emergence from&#xD;
      sevoflurane-fentanyl anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGNING:Forty patients with ASA physical status I or II scheduled for elective lumbar&#xD;
      surgery under general anesthesia (lasting for 2h to 4h)were enrolled. Anesthesia was induced&#xD;
      with propofol 1-1.5mg/kg and fentanyl 2-3μg/kg. Following muscle relaxation with iv&#xD;
      rocuronium bromide 1mg/kg endotracheal intubation was performed. Anesthesia was maintained&#xD;
      with sevoflurane(inhalational concentration: 0.8-1.5 MAC) fentanyl (total 6μg/kg) and target&#xD;
      controlled infusion remifentanil (targeted concentration:2-7ng/ml ) along with an oxygen/air&#xD;
      mixture (FiO2 = 0.5). Muscle relaxation was maintained with intermittent rocuronium.&#xD;
      Inhalational concentration of sevoflurane and injected target concentration were titrated to&#xD;
      maintain the bispectral index (BIS) between 45 and 65 during anesthesia. The end-tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide level was maintained between 30 and 40mmHg by controlled mechanical ventilation. When&#xD;
      the surgery was complicated we adjust the concentration sevoflurane to 0.8MAC of the patient&#xD;
      and targeted concentration of remifentanil to 2ng/ml and then stop all anesthetics . Record&#xD;
      time from stopping anesthetics to emergence. Arterial blood (2ml) was collected at the&#xD;
      following time, such as before and 1h after induction of anesthesia, at emergence (1min after&#xD;
      tracheal extubation) and half an hour after tracheal extubation. This was centrifuged at 3000&#xD;
      rpm for 15min at -4 ◦C in order to separate plasma then stored at -80 ◦C until assay for&#xD;
      orexin A concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS:The plasma orexin A of group elderly will be higher with the emergence time&#xD;
      longer than youth patients.&#xD;
