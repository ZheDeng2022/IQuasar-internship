  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to implement and evaluate a&#xD;
      family-focused behavioral teamwork intervention aimed at overcoming barriers to sustained&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We hypothesize&#xD;
      that CGM implemented with a family-focused, behavioral teamwork intervention will result in&#xD;
      sustained CGM use and greater improvement in A1c compared to routine implementation of CGM.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consistent CGM use in youth with T1D has been difficult to sustain historically. Youth with&#xD;
      T1D and their families have routinely felt burden related to the introduction of this&#xD;
      technology into their care management. Additionally, there can be difficulties with&#xD;
      calibration, skin irritation, frequent skips, excessive or nuisance alarms and inaccurate&#xD;
      readings which often lead to diminished use or discontinuation entirely. The purpose of this&#xD;
      protocol is to implement and evaluate a family-focused behavioral teamwork intervention aimed&#xD;
      at overcoming barriers to sustained CGM use in youth with T1D. In this 2-year RCT, we will&#xD;
      assess the long-term acceptability and durability of CGM use and its associated glycemic and&#xD;
      psychological outcomes in youth with T1D and their families. We will randomize 120 families&#xD;
      to one of two groups: (1) CGM implemented according to usual care (CGM-Usual Care, CGM-UC) or&#xD;
      (2) CGM implemented with a family teamwork intervention (CGM-Teamwork, CGM-TW). This&#xD;
      intervention will allow participants and families to overcome barriers to sustained CGM use&#xD;
      and achieve glycemic benefits that have been afforded to adults using CGM as demonstrated in&#xD;
      other research. In year 1, all CGM supplies will be provided and covered by study resources.&#xD;
      In year 2, study participants will be asked to cover the costs associated with sensor use and&#xD;
      any costs associated with replacement of CGM components in a manner consistent with routine&#xD;
      clinical care as the investigators believe that it is important to assess durability of CGM&#xD;
      use in clinical practice.&#xD;
