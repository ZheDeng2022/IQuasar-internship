      Study design: Randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel, multicentre multinational&#xD;
      clinical trial, to show superiority of an active therapy as compared to a control therapy on&#xD;
      intermittent or persistent Allergic Rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To show that a topical microemulsion is superior to a sterilized saline solution to&#xD;
           prevent deterioration in the health related quality of life, in patients with&#xD;
           intermittent or persistent allergic rhinitis due to sensitization to birch, olive tree&#xD;
           or grass pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the effect of a topical microemulsion, as compared to a sterilized saline&#xD;
           solution, for the prevention of nasal and ocular symptoms in patients with intermittent&#xD;
           or persistent allergic rhinitis due to sensitization to birch, olive tree or grass&#xD;
           pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the effect of a topical microemulsion, as compared to a sterilized saline&#xD;
           solution, in the utilization of symptomatic medications, in patients with intermittent&#xD;
           or persistent allergic rhinitis due to sensitization to birch, olive tree or grass&#xD;
           pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the patient's satisfaction with a topical microemulsion treatment, as compared&#xD;
           to a sterilized saline solution, in patients with intermittent or persistent allergic&#xD;
           rhinitis due to sensitization to birch, olive tree or grass pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the safety of a topical microemulsion, as compared to a sterilized saline&#xD;
           solution, administered to patients with intermittent or persistent allergic rhinitis due&#xD;
           to sensitization to birch, olive tree or grass pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical investigation study of a Class 1 medical device product. This is a&#xD;
      prospective study of an active medical device versus a control medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was considered feasible to recruit 10 patients patients per center, and therefore the&#xD;
      study should be conducted in 10 centers. To get treatment balance within each center, a total&#xD;
      of 100 patients should be recruited.&#xD;

      Data from the drugs/interventions to be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical investigation study of a Class 1 medical device product. This is a&#xD;
      prospective study of an active medical device versus a control medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and total number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was considered feasible to recruit 10 patients patients per center, and therefore the&#xD;
      study should be conducted in 10 centers. To get treatment balance within each center, a total&#xD;
      of 100 patients should be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to participate in the study, eligible candidates must fulfill all the following&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients of either gender, aged 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. With previous diagnostic of allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis due to&#xD;
           sensitization to birch, grass or olive tree pollens. Patients sensitized to other&#xD;
           inhaled allergens might be included provided that these other sensitizations are not&#xD;
           relevant to the patient's clinical symptoms or they are not exposed to these other&#xD;
           allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Having suffered from allergic rhinitis symptoms (severe enough to require symptomatic&#xD;
           medication usually prescribed for this condition) in previous years, but otherwise free&#xD;
           of symptoms at inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Residing during the months from March to July of 2011 in a geographical area in which&#xD;
           the exposure to birch, grass or olive tree pollens is relevant (average pollination&#xD;
           peaks of 100 grains/m3 of air during the previous specific pollen season).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Providing written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Known asthma of any origin (intrinsic or extrinsic, the latter due to any kind of&#xD;
           allergenic trigger).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis whose symptoms are exclusively due to the&#xD;
           sensitization to other inhaled allergens different from those referred in the inclusion&#xD;
           criteria, sensitization to pollens that may interfere with the patient's allergic status&#xD;
           during the study period (e.g., plane tree pollen).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis of allergic characteristics presenting in the spring&#xD;
           season but with negative allergy study (skin prick tests (SPT)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Asymptomatic sensitization to birch, grass or olive tree pollens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sensitization to birch, grass or olive tree pollens, but having had mild symptoms during&#xD;
           the spring of 2010, not requiring the use of symptomatic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sensitization to birch, grass or olive tree pollens but only presenting with asthma&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Concurrent participation in another clinical trial at the time of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Co-morbid conditions that, in the investigator's judgment, preclude them from&#xD;
           participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Continuous treatment with antihistamines, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or any&#xD;
           other drug that may alter the occurrence and/or severity of allergic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Individuals that, even if they meet the inclusion criteria, are concurrently under&#xD;
           treatment with allergen-specific immunotherapy or have received this treatment within&#xD;
           the last 36 months.&#xD;

    <description>The primary analysis will be conducted on the global score of the mini-RQLQ at visit 2 (adjusting for the baseline value). It will be conducted on all randomized patients and will be considered as confirmatory. When visit 2 assessments are lacking, then no change from baseline will be assumed and baseline values will be carried forward to visit 2. As Normality and homcedasticity may be assumed, the analysis will consist of an ANCOVA model with a fixed treatment effect and baseline values as covariates.</description>
