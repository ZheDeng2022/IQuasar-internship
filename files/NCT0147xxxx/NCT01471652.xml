  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is poorly understood and no effective&#xD;
      therapy has been developed. Recent studies suggest that a preceding viral infection causes&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction of the brain and skeletal muscle of genetically susceptible&#xD;
      individuals. There is no specific laboratory test to identify patients with CFS. However,&#xD;
      certain clinical manifestations are similar to those seen in mitochondrial disorders. Both&#xD;
      patients with mitochondrial disorders and CFS manifest elevated serum lactate levels after&#xD;
      exercise, and demonstrate elevated brain cerebrospinal fluid levels and decreased brain&#xD;
      glutathione levels on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy consisting of daily conditioning exercise, dietary recommendations, and nutraceutical&#xD;
      supplements (ENT) has been show to be beneficial in treating patients with mitochondrial&#xD;
      disorders. Similar therapy has been instituted in individual patients with CFS and has been&#xD;
      shown to also improve their clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo-controlled trial will be undertaken in 24 CFS patients aged 25-55. Patients&#xD;
      fulfilling the CDC criteria for CFS will participate in this 6 month study. Other medical&#xD;
      causes for fatigue will be excluded. Half the patients will receive treatment consisting of&#xD;
      daily conditioning exercise plus nutraceutical supplements (ENT), that has been shown to be&#xD;
      beneficial for patients with mitochondrial dysfunction, while the other half will receive&#xD;
      daily conditioning exercise and placebo tablets. Response to ENT will be evaluated by maximum&#xD;
      oxygen consumption (VO2max) and circulating lactate levels during &amp; after treadmill exercise,&#xD;
      a 6-minute walk test, and a fatigue questionnaire. In addition, whether ENT corrects the&#xD;
      elevated brain cerebrospinal fluid levels and decreased brain glutathione levels will be&#xD;
      measured. To ensure compliance to therapy patients will be monitored frequently. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of ENT and whether ENT leads to&#xD;
      sustained improvement of CFS patients compared to their baseline status, and compared to an&#xD;
      exercised group of patients not receiving supplements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalitis (ME), is clinically&#xD;
      characterized as a multisystem illness exhibiting debilitating fatigue, musculoskeletal pain,&#xD;
      disturbed sleep, and impaired memory and concentration. Its diagnosis is non-specific and&#xD;
      symptom based, with no real biomarkers yet identified. The etiology and pathophysiology of&#xD;
      CFS remain obscure. There is a long-standing hypothesis that individuals with CFS have normal&#xD;
      metabolism and their fatigue is psychological, with energy being wasted through the processes&#xD;
      of anxiety, stress, and depression. The more CFS is investigated, however, the clearer it&#xD;
      becomes that this is incorrect, and that it is probably a metabolic dysfunction resulting in&#xD;
      insufficient energy production. A number of studies have suggested that there may be a&#xD;
      genetic contribution to CFS. In addition, a severe viral illness frequently predisposes the&#xD;
      onset of CFS, while a number of pathogens have been linked to CFS (2, 3, 6). Although some&#xD;
      patients develop CFS after an acute infection such as mononucleosis, some investigators&#xD;
      believe it arises from the reactivation of a latent virus in the host, both resulting in a&#xD;
      chronic low-level activation of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As more data are acquired, we and others believe that CFS is actually a metabolic&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in insufficient energy production. Mounting evidence&#xD;
      indicates that viral infections in genetically susceptible individuals can cause changes in&#xD;
      mitochondrial function. Many features observed in CFS are similar to those seen in genetic&#xD;
      mitochondrial disorders. Firstly, some muscle biopsies in patients with CFS have shown both&#xD;
      abnormal mitochondrial degeneration and severe deletions of mitochondrial DNA genes.&#xD;
      Mitochondrial dysfunction increases the production of free radicals and reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species (ROS), which cause oxidative damage, believed to contribute to CFS pathogenesis.&#xD;
      Carnitine is required for metabolic reactions including mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. A&#xD;
      deficiency of serum acylcarnitine has been observed in CFS patients, suggesting that there is&#xD;
      increased utilization of carnitine in CFS, thereby decreasing energy production. In&#xD;
      mitochondrial disorders, utilization of pyruvate is decreased, resulting in higher&#xD;
      circulating and muscle levels of lactate, as well as decreased oxidative phosphorylation and&#xD;
      energy production. Brain ventricular cerebrospinal lactate is elevated, and brain glutathione&#xD;
      is decreased, in both mitochondrial disorders and CFS. In CFS patients cerebrospinal lactate&#xD;
      is increased by approximately 300% compared to that found in generalized anxiety disorder and&#xD;
      healthy individuals. Using brain NMR spectroscopy, the distinction between CFS and&#xD;
      psychological disorders can be demonstrated.&#xD;
