  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major risk factor of chronic heart failure (CHF). Glycemic control&#xD;
      in patients with the combination of T2D and CHF is complicated and the currently available&#xD;
      treatments have proven to be inadequate in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To investigate the effect of Liraglutide compared to placebo on left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF) in CHF patients with and without T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter, randomized, double blind study of 240 patients with documented systolic CHF (50%&#xD;
      with T2DM) will be randomised. The effect of Liraglutide on left ventricular systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic function will be evaluated by advanced echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome parameter is change in LVEF from visit 1 to week 24.&#xD;

      Background The number of patients with diabetes in Denmark has doubled in the preceding&#xD;
      10-years period and has now increased to 271.000 individuals (5% of the population). T2D is a&#xD;
      major risk factor of CHF and CHF per se is associated with insulin resistance, thus T2D and&#xD;
      CHF often co-exists, and is associated with markedly impaired prognosis. Glycemic control in&#xD;
      patients with the combination of T2D and CHF is complicated and the currently available&#xD;
      treatments have proven to be inadequate in clinical trials. Therefore, new treatment&#xD;
      modalities of hyperglycaemia in CHF are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a naturally existing hormone, which is secreted from the&#xD;
      incretine system. A beneficial effect of GLP-1 on cardiac function has recently been&#xD;
      suggested in small clinical studies, demonstrating improved left ventricular ejection&#xD;
      fraction (LVEF) in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Liraglutide (Victoza®) is a&#xD;
      GLP-1-analogue developed for the treatment of T2D. However, the impact of Liraglutide on&#xD;
      cardiac function is currently under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary objective: To investigate the effect of Liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily&#xD;
      compared to placebo on LVEF in CHF patients with and without T2D after 24 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To investigate the effect of Liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily compared to&#xD;
      placebo on left ventricular diastolic function, on plasma levels of NT-proBNP, on symptoms of&#xD;
      heart failure and quality of life over 24 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Multicenter, randomized, double blind study evaluating the impact of 24 weeks&#xD;
      treatment of Liraglutide versus placebo on cardiac function in CHF patients with and without&#xD;
      T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population A total of 240 patients with documented systolic CHF (50% with T2DM) will be&#xD;
      randomised. The effect of Liraglutide on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function&#xD;
      will be evaluated by advanced echocardiography using 2D, 3D, and tissue Doppler imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome parameter is change in LVEF from visit 1 to week 24&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives Irrespective of the outcome, the study will contribute with essential&#xD;
      information regarding treatment of CHF. Potentially Liraglutide can improve heart function&#xD;
      substantially, thus changing the prognosis of CHF-patients worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed statistical analyses plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Primary objective To investigate the effect of liraglutide uptitrated to a maximum&#xD;
      of 1.8 mg once daily compared with placebo for 24 weeks on the difference in left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline to follow-up in chronic heart failure patients (CHF)&#xD;
      patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives To investigate the effect of liraglutide compared with placebo in terms&#xD;
      of change from baseline to follow-up of&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Left ventricular contractile function measured by I. Global longitudinal strain by&#xD;
           speckle tracking II. Mitral plane systolic annular max velocity by TDI (s', average of&#xD;
           six points)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) and end-diastolic volume (LVEDV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Grade of diastolic function&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Functional capacity measured by a 6-minute walk test (6MWT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Plasma NT-proBNP levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Quality of life evaluated by the MLHF questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Hospitalisations due to cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. All-cause mortality (will be confirmed by the Central Personal Register)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators who were blinded to liraglutide versus placebo assessed all the outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will analyse data as treatment group A and B, and only when all primary&#xD;
      analyses have been performed and approved then data can be unblinded. The managing committee&#xD;
      has contributed to the preparation of the analysis plan and did also approve it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Primary objective The primary outcome parameter is change in LVEF from visit 1 to&#xD;
      week 24. A total of 241 patients were randomised to allow for approximately 20% of the&#xD;
      randomised patients with major protocol deviations or withdrawal. With 90% power and with a&#xD;
      two-sided significance level of 0.05, the sample size analysis estimated the study to detect&#xD;
      a difference of 2.5% in LVEF in absolute values. The power analysis was based on a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 6% in delta EF (absolute units). An absolute difference of 2.5% in change from&#xD;
      baseline between the two treatment groups was based on clinical relevance as determined from&#xD;
      studies of the impact of ACE inhibitors and betablockers on LVEF. These key outcome&#xD;
      ACE-inhibitor and key betablocker trials showed a relative risk reduction in outcome of&#xD;
      approximately 25 - 30% during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification The randomisations were performed using two stratification variables: Gender&#xD;
      (female/male) and diabetes (yes/no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management Data were collected real time in a custom-made web based electronic case&#xD;
      record form (eCRF) hosted by an external data management unit at Aarhus University. In&#xD;
      compliance with GCP, a study manual on collection of endpoints and procedures were developed,&#xD;
      and quality assurance of relevant instruments collected in sponsors trial master file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on other adverse events assessed by the investigator as clinically significant,&#xD;
      including abnormal laboratory values, were collected and recorded on standardised forms at&#xD;
      each contact. These data were reported to the relevant authorities in accordance with current&#xD;
      legislation and ICH-GCP guidelines. An unblinded data monitoring committee, consisting of&#xD;
      independent cardiologists and endocrinologists, were established to evaluate events during&#xD;
      study conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
      Sites were encouraged to obtain a final measure of the primary endpoint as soon as possible&#xD;
      after a patient terminated study medication prematurely. Multiple imputation methods will be&#xD;
      applied to handle missing data on the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A per protocol analysis will also be performed. The per protocol population will consist of&#xD;
      all patients who completed the study with a documented valid baseline, 24 week assessment of&#xD;
      the primary objective and no major protocol deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed as the difference from baseline to follow-up. Normally distributed&#xD;
      variables will be presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), whereas non-normally&#xD;
      distributed variables will be presented as median [range]. Comparisons between groups will be&#xD;
      performed by an unpaired Student's t-test or ANOVA when data are normally distributed.&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis will be used for non-normally&#xD;
      distributed data. Subgroup analyses will be made with respect to: presence of diabetes, cause&#xD;
      of heart failure (ischemic/non-ischemic), body mass index, NYHA-class, LVEF above/below mean,&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. Linear regression will be used to study correlation between outcome&#xD;
      parameters and baseline patient characteristics. Categorical variables are presented as&#xD;
      number and percentage; Chi-square-test is used to compare groups of categorical variables.&#xD;
      P-values &lt;0.05 are considered statistically significant. All calculations will be performed&#xD;
      using a commercially available program (SPSS for Windows and Mac, version 22.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and handling of missing data Most statistical methods fail to handle any case that&#xD;
      has a missing value, which may introduce bias or affect the representativeness of the&#xD;
      results. Imputation preserves all cases by replacing missing data with a probable value based&#xD;
      on other available information in the data set. Once all missing values have been imputed,&#xD;
      the data set can then be analysed using standard techniques for complete data. Imputation&#xD;
      methods will be applied to handle missing data on the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of patients at baseline A description of baseline characteristics by&#xD;
      intervention group will be presented. Discrete variables will be summarised by frequencies&#xD;
      and percentages. Percentages will be calculated according to the total number of patients in&#xD;
      the particular group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be summarised using standard measures of central tendency and&#xD;
      dispersion using either mean ± SD for data with normal distribution or median and&#xD;
      interquartile range for non-normally distributed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline of figures and tables The first figure will be a consort flow chart of respectively&#xD;
      GLP-1 versus placebo. The first tables will describe the baseline characteristics. Follow-up&#xD;
      data will be described in tables.&#xD;
