      The primary aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the effect of antipsychotics on&#xD;
      infant development especially neurobehavioral development which evaluated by the Bayley-III&#xD;
      when mothers are treated with antipsychotics throughout their pregnancy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The neurodevelopmental effect of antipsychotics on fetus has always been a major concern for&#xD;
      women who need antipsychotic treatments and are in their reproductive years. The fear of&#xD;
      harmful effects from antipsychotic on fetus and unplanned pregnancy commonly causes&#xD;
      non-adherence to treatments. Even for those who are willing to maintain their antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatments during pregnancy, the fear of potential harmful effects from antipsychotic on&#xD;
      fetus can still exist. It is well known that non-adherence to antipsychotic treatments in&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia can cause most to relapse and poor treatment response. The&#xD;
      consequences of relapse not only increase personal suffering, but also increase family and&#xD;
      societal burden.Clearly, it is important to evaluate the safety of antipsychotics during&#xD;
      pregnancy. However, up to now, most information about antipsychotics on reproductive safety&#xD;
      and the effects on infant development come from case reports, case series, and retrospective&#xD;
      studies.So the study was to investigate the developmental effects of antipsychotics on&#xD;
      infants who were exposed to as fetus.&#xD;
