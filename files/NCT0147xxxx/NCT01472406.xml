      This clinical trial is a feasibility study to assess the performance of an Artificial&#xD;
      Pancreas (AP) device using the Artificial Pancreas System (APS©) platform for subjects with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. The device is a closed-loop between a DexCom™ SEVEN® PLUS (DexCom™ Corp, San&#xD;
      Diego, CA) continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and a OneTouch® Ping® Glucose Monitoring System&#xD;
      (Animas Corp, Westchester, PA) subcutaneous insulin delivery pump (CSII). The AP device is&#xD;
      controlled by a zone-Model Predictive Control (zone-MPC) algorithm augmented by a safety&#xD;
      algorithm named the Health Monitoring System (HMS). The clinical study will include 12 to 20&#xD;
      adults subjects aged 21 to 65 years old.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of an evaluation of the Artificial Pancreas device during a 24-hour&#xD;
      closed-loop in a clinic environment (Sansum Diabetes Research Institute, Santa Barbara, CA).&#xD;
      The 24-hour period includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 unannounced meals (evening dinner and breakfast);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 period of 30 minutes of exercise at 50% of the predicted heart rate reserve (HRR)&#xD;
           preceded with a snack and followed by a snack 3 hours later (on Day 2);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete night from 12:00 am to 7:00 am; The subject will arrive at approximately 4:00&#xD;
           pm to the CRC (clinical research center), the closed-loop will be initiated at&#xD;
           approximately 4:30 pm that same day and continued until 4:30 pm the next day. A&#xD;
           physician will be monitoring the patient with the artificial Pancreas (AP) device at all&#xD;
           time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will evaluate the performance of the AP device in predicting the fall and&#xD;
      rise of glucose values and in regulating insulin delivery to mitigate extreme blood glucose&#xD;
      variations during the following challenges:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  following unannounced meals,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  during a nocturnal period, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  during a period of active exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to demonstrate that the AP device is able to maintain the subject blood glucose&#xD;
      within a safe range at all times. One of the objectives of the study will be to measure the&#xD;
      percent of time spent in the following zones:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  [80-140] mg/dL at all times unless described otherwise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  [80-140] mg/dL during the nocturnal period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  [70-180] mg/dL postprandial, for 5 hours following the unannounced meals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  [70-150] mg/dL during and for 3 hours following exercise It is anticipated that&#xD;
           following the planned challenges, glucose value might increase temporarily beyond those&#xD;
           ranges. These excursions will be reviewed and analyzed (value and duration) and the&#xD;
           study will determine how the AP device mitigates those excursions and maintains glucose&#xD;
           levels within a safe and acceptable range. The clinical study will also review any event&#xD;
           that occur during the course of the 24-hour closed-loop: hypoglycemic events,&#xD;
           hyperglycemic events, outside intervention, other Adverse Event, Serious Adverse Events,&#xD;
           Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect, and device complaints for the commercial devices&#xD;
           used. The safety of the patient will remain the primary goal. The goal of the AP device&#xD;
           is to operate without outside intervention even when challenged by meals or exercise&#xD;
           unless the outside intervention is requested by the Health Monitoring System (HMS).&#xD;
