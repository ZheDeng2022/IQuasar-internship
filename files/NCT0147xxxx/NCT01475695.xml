    <textblock>
      Approximately 6 healthy male subjects will be administered a single 1500 mg intravenous dose&#xD;
      of 14C-GSK2251052 under fasted conditions. Blood, urine and fecal samples will be collected&#xD;
      for a minimum of 14 days following study drug administration. Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after study drug&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
