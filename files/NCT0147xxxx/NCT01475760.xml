      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of chitosan chewing gum (K2CG) in&#xD;
      reducing serum phosphorus in subjects with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the public health importance of increased P levels in the general population and&#xD;
      specifically in patients with chronic kidney disease, it is of great importance to evaluate&#xD;
      the ability of a medical food such as K2CG to reduce elevated serum P levels. In patients&#xD;
      with CKD receiving dialysis it has been estimated that sustained control of serum P may&#xD;
      result in an approximate 17% reduction in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have conducted a previous pilot double blind randomized controlled study of&#xD;
      K2CG 20 mg and 40 mg BID for 4 weeks in 90 patients with ESRD. In this initial study the&#xD;
      investigators did not observe a statistically significant reduction in either serum P or&#xD;
      salivary P with active therapy as compared to placebo. However, a clear trend towards a&#xD;
      reduction in serum P was seen in the randomized phase of the study with the active gum&#xD;
      administered twice a day. During the open-label period where the gum was administered&#xD;
      thrice-daily the investigators did see a statistically significant reduction in serum P of&#xD;
      0.3 mg/dL. Moreover, in patients with CKD not on dialysis, the investigators observed a&#xD;
      reduction in mean serum P of approximately 0.2 mg/dL. While not statistically significant,&#xD;
      this trial was not powered to detect this level of change in serum P and was underpowered to&#xD;
      do so.. Differences in this range (0.2-0.4 mg/dL) have been reported in studies utilizing&#xD;
      dietary manipulation (plant protein versus animal protein) and with the use of Niacin and are&#xD;
      felt to be clinically meaningful reductions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously also conducted a cross-sectional observational study&#xD;
      evaluating salivary P levels across a wide spectrum of eGFR. The data indicate that mean&#xD;
      salivary P is uniformly increased (15-25 mg/dL) relative to serum P (2.5- 4.5 mg/dL) being&#xD;
      approximately 5-7X higher as shown below (group 1 = eGFR &gt; 90, group 7= eGFR &lt; 15).&#xD;
      Importantly, salivary P was similar across the entire spectrum of eGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously conducted a clinical trial evaluating several different&#xD;
      formulations of K2CG with varying amounts of chitosan loading into the gum base, variable&#xD;
      weights of gum base and 2 different formulations of gum base. In these trials the&#xD;
      investigators further studied the effects of gum chewing in either the fasted or fed state&#xD;
      and the effects of varying amounts of gum chewing time. Results from this study have&#xD;
      demonstrated that the maximal amount of P loading into the K2CG is seen with the 1g chewing&#xD;
      gum containing 20 mg chitosan and that the maximal effect is seen with 30 minutes of gum&#xD;
      chewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data from this study the investigators have chosen this strength/formulation for the&#xD;
      primary efficacy endpoint assessment in the current protocol. Similar efficacy results with&#xD;
      regard to total P loading per chewing gum were seen with the 2.0 gram, 60 mg chitosan chewing&#xD;
      gum and there was an indication that subjects had a subjective preference for this&#xD;
      formulation. As a result, this protocol will also assess (as a secondary efficacy endpoint)&#xD;
      the reduction in serum P with this strength/formulation during an open label phase only in&#xD;
      those subjects who have responded during the primary efficacy assessment phase. This will&#xD;
      allow a comparison of efficacy between the 2 gum sizes/strengths among known 'responders'&#xD;
      with regard to serum P reduction.&#xD;
