  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrogin-1 and muscle RING finger-1 are skeletal muscle specific genes, with ubiquitin ligase&#xD;
      activities, that are upregulated during muscle atrophy in mice. The Akt/GSK3 and Akt/mTOR&#xD;
      pathways are involved in muscle hypertrophy in mice. Recent studies by the investigators team&#xD;
      and others have demonstrated the implication of these signalling pathways in the control of&#xD;
      muscle mass in humans. However no study has yet investigated the involvement of these systems&#xD;
      in the early stages of spinal cord injury induced human skeletal muscle atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to investigate the level of expression of the different components&#xD;
      of the ubiquitin-proteasome system together with the level of expression and activity of the&#xD;
      Akt/mTOR and Akt/GSK3 signalling pathways after SCI in humans during the first months&#xD;
      following the injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second aim of this project is to assess if a novel apparatus of electrical stimulation&#xD;
      which generate movements by closed-loop electrical muscle stimulation may improve strength&#xD;
      and muscle mass in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited jointly at the Clinique Romande de Réadaptation (CRR) in Sion&#xD;
      and the Swiss paraplegic centre in Nottwil. They will be randomly divided into two groups, a&#xD;
      first group of patients will undergo a conventional treatment of rehabilitation while a&#xD;
      second set of patients will be treated using a brand new system of electro-stimulation called&#xD;
      MotionMaker TM. Biopsies will be obtained in the first weeks after admission; two other&#xD;
      biopsies will be taken respectively 3 and 6 months post-lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our results will provide an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing&#xD;
      to skeletal muscle atrophy during the early stages following SCI and a characterization of&#xD;
      the impact of endurance training in the no more voluntary innervated muscle. Moreover this&#xD;
      study will also investigate the potential improvement in the rehabilitation process by using&#xD;
      a new system of electro-stimulation.&#xD;

      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each group, the muscle biopsies will be divided into 3 samples which will be used for a)&#xD;
      real-time PCR to quantify the gene expression of the different components of the&#xD;
      ubiquitin-proteasome system (Atrogin-1, MuRF1, Nedd4, UBB and Psma) b) Western blotting,&#xD;
      using anti-phospho-site specific antibodies to quantify the activities of the Akt/GSK3 and&#xD;
      Akt/mTOR pathways and of their downstream regulators of protein synthesis, eIF2B, p70S6K and&#xD;
      PHAS-1/4E-BP1and c) fiber type analysis to quantify the variation in MHC expression.&#xD;
