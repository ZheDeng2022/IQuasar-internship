  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Much of community transmission of seasonal and pandemic influenza occurs in younger&#xD;
      individuals, because of their susceptibility and their social interaction&#xD;
      patterns.Universities are places where transmission of influenza is facilitated because of&#xD;
      the age of individuals involved, their close contact with each other, and low vaccination&#xD;
      coverage. Staying home when you are sick (i.e., voluntary sequestration) has been identified&#xD;
      as one of the most efficient ways to reduce influenza transmission, but there are still&#xD;
      insufficient data on the effects of social distancing to be able to make recommendations for&#xD;
      future pandemics or even outbreaks of seasonal influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are conducting a study on the effect of voluntary sequestration during&#xD;
      illness on the transmission of influenza among social networks in University residence&#xD;
      housing units at the University of Michigan. The sequestration interventions will be carried&#xD;
      out during a period of influenza transmission that is defined by surveillance conducted at&#xD;
      the University Health Service. Data will be collected on use of the interventions and the&#xD;
      occurrence of influenza and other illnesses. In all selected residence halls, specimens will&#xD;
      be collected when illness meeting a case definition for influenza-like illness occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study in a university population will evaluate the acceptability and magnitude of effect&#xD;
      that can be expected from such an intervention, and determine the number of days that&#xD;
      sequestration should be practiced.&#xD;
