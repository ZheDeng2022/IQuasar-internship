  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of imatinib (as&#xD;
      mesilate) in healthy subjects exposed inhaled lipopolysaccharide. During the study, eight&#xD;
      oral doses of imatinib, or placebo, will each be taken 12 hours apart, before subjects are&#xD;
      exposed to nebulized lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Four hours after LPS exposure, a&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be undertaken, and BAL fluid (BALF collected. Once study&#xD;
      assessments are completed, a follow-up visit will be conducted approximately 7 days after the&#xD;
      last dose of imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effect of imatinib on LPS-induced&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular dysfunction. The primary endpoints of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in the number of neutrophils in BALF 6 hours after the LPS challenge in subjects&#xD;
           exposed to imatinib compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in concentration of total protein in BALF 6 hours after the LPS challenge in&#xD;
           subjects exposed to imatinib compared with placebo&#xD;
