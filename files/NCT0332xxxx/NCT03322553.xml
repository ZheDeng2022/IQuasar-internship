  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients becoming dependent on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.&#xD;
      Long term use of PPI therapy can be associated with side effects such as osteoporosis, small&#xD;
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth and renal failure. Moreover, some of the patients might be&#xD;
      reluctant to take PPIs for long duration and prefer surgery over pharmacotherapy. Endoscopic&#xD;
      plication (GERD-X) is an alternative and less invasive procedure compared to laparoscopic&#xD;
      fundoplication for the treatment of GERD. In endoscopic plication, transmural sutures are&#xD;
      applied at the gastro-esophageal (GE) junction thereby reconstructing the gastric cardia and&#xD;
      accentuating the valvular mechanism to prevent reflux. Only few trials have evaluated the&#xD;
      efficacy of endoscopic plication technique and reported encouraging results. In this study we&#xD;
      aim to evaluate the efficacy of a similar endoscopic technique but with application of two&#xD;
      transmural sutures in randomized controlled method.&#xD;

      Patients screening and inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over 6-month period. Data of patients presenting with PPI&#xD;
      dependent GERD will be recorded and maintained. At initial screening, GERD health related&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire (GERD HRQL) and requirement of anti-secretory medicines&#xD;
      (detailed drug history) will be assessed along with gastroscopy. All anti-secretory medicines&#xD;
      will be stopped for 7 days and GERD HRQL will be reassessed off drugs. Esophageal high&#xD;
      resolution manometry with 24-h pH impedance monitoring will be done on the 8th day after&#xD;
      stopping medicines. Basal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, esophageal motility&#xD;
      pattern, 24-h esophageal acid exposure, non acidic bolus reflux, number of reflux episodes,&#xD;
      DeMeester score, symptom index and symptom association probability would be assessed. Those&#xD;
      patients with pathologic esophageal acid exposure (esophageal pH &lt;4 for &gt;4.2% of 24-h period)&#xD;
      will be included in the trial. Patients will then be randomly assigned by a computer to&#xD;
      either GERD-X or sham procedure with a target ratio of 1:1. The patient, principle&#xD;
      investigator and the study coordinators would be blinded to the treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients allocated to endoscopic plication, endoscopic full-thickness plication will be&#xD;
      performed using the GERDX® system. All procedures will be performed under general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Savary-guidewire will be placed into the stomach using a gastroscope. The GERDX® system will&#xD;
      be introduced over the guidewire and into the stomach. The subsequent procedure will be&#xD;
      performed as described in previous studies, using a similar device (NDO Plicator). According&#xD;
      to study protocol, at least 2 pretied transmural pledgeted sutures will be deployed to&#xD;
      achieve a tight closure of GE junction around the endoscope. In sham procedure, identical&#xD;
      technique will be followed by positioning the plicator 1cm below the GE junction but sutures&#xD;
      will not be deployed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post intervention monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the intervention, patients would be placed on soft diet and on demand&#xD;
      analgesics for 5 days. Twice daily PPI will be given for all patients and would be stopped&#xD;
      after 7 days. Thereafter, if patient experiences reflux symptoms, sucralfate, H2 blocker and&#xD;
      PPI would be started sequentially in case of no response to the former drug after a period of&#xD;
      7days of therapy on each drug. Requirement and reintroduction of drugs will be enquired over&#xD;
      phone and recorded appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits will be carried out at 3, 6 and 12 months. During each visit, gastroscopy&#xD;
      will be done to assess the gastro-esophageal junction along with evaluation of GERD HRQL and&#xD;
      requirement of PPI. At 3 months post intervention, esophageal manometry and 24-h pH impedance&#xD;
      monitoring would be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement in GERD HRQL by more than 50% from baseline at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement in GERD HRQL at 3, 6 and 12 months Improvement in symptom score and requirement&#xD;
      of PPI at 3, 6 and 12 months Improvement in esophageal acid exposure and lower esophageal&#xD;
      sphincter pressure at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The trial was designed to have a 90% power to detect a difference in&#xD;
      GERD-HRQL post intervention at 5% level of significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of improvement in GERD-HRQL for sham group is 35% and for active group is 70 %. A&#xD;
      sample size of 38 is required for each group to achieve a statistical power of 80% at 5% type&#xD;
      I error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Continuous data will be expressed as median and inter-quartile range&#xD;
      (IQR). Frequency will be expressed as percentage (%). Continuous and categorical data between&#xD;
      active and sham groups will be compared using Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test, with&#xD;
      Yates' correction as applicable, respectively. P values below 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
