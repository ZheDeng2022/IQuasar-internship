      Radical cystectomy (bladder removal) after bladder cancer necessitates surgical&#xD;
      reconstruction to allow urine drainage. Usually, this is achieved by either ileal conduit (a&#xD;
      stoma leads to an external bag) or orthotopic neobladder (the creation of an artificial&#xD;
      internal bladder). These treatments are most successful when tailored to the patient's own&#xD;
      lifestyle needs. The current project will explore patient concerns, and the aspects of their&#xD;
      lifestyles and values, that influence their choice of bladder reconstruction. It will also&#xD;
      examine which of these concerns and values best predict satisfaction and enhanced QoL,&#xD;
      following bladder reconstruction. Participants will be recruited from Health Board databases&#xD;
      of those who have had advanced bladder cancer (grade pT1 and above) and undergone either IC&#xD;
      or NB procedures within the last five years. 40 participants (equal numbers with each&#xD;
      surgical procedure) will be randomly selected from the patient databases. They will be&#xD;
      interviewed by a Researcher and a Clinical Nurse Specialist. A semi-structured interview will&#xD;
      be conducted to ascertain patients' views about the key factors influencing their treatment&#xD;
      decision and their satisfaction with the outcome. Approximately 200 participants (equal&#xD;
      numbers with IC and NB) will be sent three questionnaires to assess their life values, QoL,&#xD;
      and satisfaction with treatment: (1) Bladder Reconstruction Satisfaction Questionnaire&#xD;
      measuring levels of satisfaction with bladder reconstruction; (2) EORTC QLQ-C30 measuring QoL&#xD;
      in areas relevant to cancer patients; and (3) Life Values Inventory measuring values and&#xD;
      lifestyles important to patients. Participants will be asked to complete the questionnaires&#xD;
      and return them using a prepaid envelope. Participants will be provided with the contact&#xD;
      details of a Clinical Nurse Specialist known to them to contact if they require help&#xD;
      completing the questionnaires.&#xD;

      Aims and Objectives. The proposed research aims: firstly, to enhance our understanding of&#xD;
      patient concerns, lifestyles, and values, that influence their choice of bladder&#xD;
      reconstruction and predict their treatment satisfaction and quality of life (QoL); and,&#xD;
      secondly, to initiate the development a novel decision-aid tool to help bladder-cancer&#xD;
      patients, their families, and medical/health professionals to choose the reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery following bladder removal that best suits a patient's needs. To these ends, a&#xD;
      complementary combination of qualitative and quantitative research approaches will be&#xD;
      employed to obtain information from patients about the reasons for their reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery choices, the aspects of their lifestyle that were most important to them in reaching&#xD;
      their decisions, and the degree to which they are satisfied with their reconstruction. These&#xD;
      findings will be used to inform the items to be contained in a pilot joint decision-making&#xD;
      tool to support patients and medical professionals when planning such life-changing surgery.&#xD;
      Such a tool ultimately could support patient choice, enhance QoL, and influence&#xD;
      decision-making practice. Thus, the specific objectives of the research will be to: (1)&#xD;
      identify the factors important for patients when choosing a bladder reconstruction; (2)&#xD;
      establish the degree to which these factors predict satisfaction with the reconstruction;&#xD;
      and, ultimately, (3) start to develop a joint decision-aid tool for patients and medical&#xD;
      staff, to use when deciding on the choice of diversionary procedure, that highlights these&#xD;
      key factors predicting success and better QoL following different forms of bladder&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and Project Plan. Participants Participants will be recruited from Health Board&#xD;
      databases of those who have had advanced bladder cancer (grade pT1 and above) and undergone&#xD;
      either IC or NB procedures within the last five years. Around 40 patients per year are&#xD;
      referred to the ABMU; this is in line with expectations, given the size of the ABMU patient&#xD;
      population (600,000) and rates of bladder cancer, giving a potential sample of 200 patients&#xD;
      over the previous five years. This will provide an adequate population from which to sample&#xD;
      participants. No form of payment will be offered for participation, but participants will be&#xD;
      reimbursed for travel expenses. There will be no other inclusion or exclusion criteria in&#xD;
      order to access a wide range of patients with potentially different values and lifestyles,&#xD;
      and to aid in the recruitment of adequate sample sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Study Forty participants (equal numbers with each surgical procedure) will be&#xD;
      randomly selected from the patient databases and invited for interview. This number is&#xD;
      achievable given the size of the database, and exceeds the usual criteria (12-18; Guest et&#xD;
      al., 2006) for saturation in qualitative research, even with expectation of some&#xD;
      non-participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be interviewed by a Researcher and a Clinical Nurse Specialist in a&#xD;
      quiet room in the Clinical Research Unit of the Hospital. A semi-structured interview format&#xD;
      will be adopted to allow participants latitude in expressing issues that are important to&#xD;
      them, and without forcing particular issues. The same semi-structured interview script will&#xD;
      be used for each participant, ensuring all are asked the same questions. The general themes&#xD;
      to be asked about will be: Who patients consulted and discussed options with; What types of&#xD;
      information, support, and advice were they offered; What were the attributes or aspects of&#xD;
      the NB/IC that influenced their choice; Which aspects of their lifestyle were most important&#xD;
      in making a decision; What factors could have been considered that were not; What types of&#xD;
      help have they been offered since; Could they have been offered other information at the&#xD;
      time; How do they feel their choice influences their life today; Are they satisfied with&#xD;
      their decision. These questions will allow a wide range of patient needs, values, and&#xD;
      experiences to be elicited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcribed interview recordings will be subjected to thematic content analysis, in line with&#xD;
      previous recommendations (Vaughn et al., 1996), and accepted procedures in health contexts&#xD;
      (Osborne et al., 2012a; 2012b; Osborne &amp; Reed, 2008). Transcripts will be examined&#xD;
      independently by two Researchers to identify key themes and ensure reliability. Individual&#xD;
      'units of information' contained within each transcript will be highlighted (a 'unit' is any&#xD;
      piece of text that relates to an identified theme, and that can be interpreted on its own to&#xD;
      provide a meaningful and informative comment). From reading the unitised comments, the&#xD;
      initial themes will be refined, so that all 'units of information' can be categorised&#xD;
      according to those themes. Coding of 'units' into themes will be conducted independently by&#xD;
      two Researchers, and Cohen's Kappa will be used to establish reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Study One hundred participants (equal numbers with IC and NB) will be randomly&#xD;
      selected from the Health Board database, as described above. The numbers in the database&#xD;
      (200) will allow recruitment of these participants, and, assuming a 50% non-return rate, this&#xD;
      will allow sufficient power for subsequent analyses. G-Power calculations suggest that, to&#xD;
      identify a moderate relationship (r = .3) with 85% power, a sample size of 90 will be needed.&#xD;
      If recruitment appears to be low, then other health boards (in particular, Newcastle with&#xD;
      whom Mr. Younis is currently employed) will be approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete three questionnaires and to return them using a&#xD;
      prepaid envelope. Participants will be provided with contact details of a Clinical Nurse&#xD;
      Specialist known to them if they require help completing three questionnaires: Bladder&#xD;
      Reconstruction Satisfaction Questionnaire measures levels of satisfaction with bladder&#xD;
      reconstruction, the relative ease of adapting to the new bladder, and specific aspects&#xD;
      patients are happy or unhappy with regarding their procedure; EORTC QLQ-30 (Aaronson et al.,&#xD;
      1993) assesses QoL aspects relevant to cancer patients concerning: physical functioning; role&#xD;
      functioning; emotional functioning; cognitive functioning; social functioning; and global&#xD;
      health status. This questionnaire is reliable and has been used by a large number of&#xD;
      researchers (Mystakidou et al., 2001); The Life Values Inventory (Crace &amp; Brown, 1996)&#xD;
      measures values across: achievement, belonging, concern for the environment, concern for&#xD;
      others, creativity, financial prosperity, health and activity, humility, independence,&#xD;
      loyalty to family or group, privacy, responsibility, scientific understanding, and&#xD;
      spirituality. The internal reliability is high (Cheng &amp; Fleischmann, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The values identified will be related by regression analyses to QoL and satisfaction in order&#xD;
      to identify whether there are different predictors of outcome for different forms of bladder&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Tool Development Converging themes emerging from the two studies in terms of predicting&#xD;
      satisfaction with IC and NB will be drawn together, and a decision-aid tool will be produced&#xD;
      for future study. The items identified for inclusion in the tool will be sent to a range of&#xD;
      health professionals involved in delivery of surgery and physiotherapy (consultant surgeons,&#xD;
      registrars, clinical nurse specialists, and past patients) to obtain their views on its face&#xD;
      validity. Items that are rated as inappropriate or redundant will be re-assessed and&#xD;
      potentially excluded from the tool, and any missing areas of importance identified by the&#xD;
      expert panel will be re-examined.&#xD;
