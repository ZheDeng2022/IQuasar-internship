      This phase Ib/II trial studies the best dose of glembatumumab vedotin when giving together&#xD;
      with nivolumab and ipilimumab in treating patients with solid tumor that has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body and cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      glembatumumab vedotin, nivolumab, and ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of glembatumumab&#xD;
      vedotin and nivolumab in patients with solid tumors. (Phase Ib) II. To evaluate the antitumor&#xD;
      activity of the combination in 4 expansion cohorts (melanoma, uveal melanoma, GPNMB&#xD;
      overexpressing triple negative breast cancer [TNBC], other GPNMB overexpressing solid tumors)&#xD;
      as measured by overall response by Immune-Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (iRECIST)/Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety and toxicity profile of the combination. II. To evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical benefit rate (no disease progression within 6 months), progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients receiving the combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of glembatumumab vedotin and nivolumab in&#xD;
      combination in serum and in mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) cells in peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Profile differences in the type, number and density of Fc-receptors (FcgammaR) on MPS&#xD;
      cells in blood of patients prior to and after administration of glembatumumab vedotin and&#xD;
      nivolumab as a method to evaluate the factors affecting PK and pharmacodynamics (PD)&#xD;
      variability and mechanisms of drug-drug interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Characterize differences in chemokines (CCL2 and CCL5) and other cytokines in blood of&#xD;
      patients prior to and after administration of glembatumumab vedotin and nivolumab as a method&#xD;
      to evaluate the factors affecting PK and PD variability and mechanisms of drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of the combination in plasma and tissue&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive glembatumumab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and nivolumab IV&#xD;
      over 60 minutes on day 8 of course 1 and on day 1 of subsequent courses. Patients in melanoma&#xD;
      expanded cohort also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with&#xD;
      ipilimumab repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unaccepted toxicity and courses with glembatumumab vedotin and nivolumab repeat every 21 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then at 30 and&#xD;
      70 days.&#xD;

    <description>PD-L1 and other immune biomarkers including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes before and after treatment (after glembatumumab vedotin, and then after the combination) will be described using summary statistics. The change of immune markers will be assessed using linear mixed model for repeated measurement data.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models will be used to evaluate predictive ability of these baseline biomarkers on the response to the combination of glembatumumab vedotin and nivolumab. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be used to explore the optimal cut-off points for each biomarker to differentiate responders versus non-responders. The predictive ability will also be summarized using the area under ROC curves (AUC), and the 95% confidence intervals of AUC will be obtained using bootstrap resampling methods.</description>

             connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's,&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients with a history of toxic epidermal&#xD;
             necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be&#xD;
             excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease; patients with&#xD;
             vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis managed with replacement&#xD;
             hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible; patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with&#xD;
             topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies&#xD;
             (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ&#xD;
             involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents&#xD;
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease; patients are permitted to&#xD;
             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids&#xD;
             (with minimal systemic absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if =&lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief&#xD;
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for&#xD;
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction&#xD;
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal&#xD;
             abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are&#xD;
             known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need&#xD;
             for additional treatment before coming on study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any vaccines against infectious diseases (e.g. influenza, varicella,&#xD;
             pneumococcus) within 4 weeks of initiation of study treatment&#xD;
