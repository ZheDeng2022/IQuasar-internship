  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new inhaler, Bevespi improves lung&#xD;
      function. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using inhaled hyperpolarized 129Xe gas, that can&#xD;
      provide useful images of the functioning of the lung will be used as a new measure to&#xD;
      determine change in function. The investigator anticipate these images will provide more&#xD;
      specific information about lung disease than standard lung function tests in response to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will characterize ventilation and gas transfer distributions in GOLD II and III&#xD;
      COPD patients and assess the potential for these physiological parameters as a novel&#xD;
      phenotyping method using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using inhaled hyperpolarized 129Xe&#xD;
      gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will additionally quantify regional ventilation and gas transfer response to&#xD;
      glycopyrrolate/formoterol in GOLD II and III COPD patients.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Between April 2018 and October 2019, 52 outpatient pulmonary clinic patients were approached about potential participation in the study. Twenty-six participants signed a written informed consent prior to enrollment and the HIPAA-compliant study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Duke University Medical Center (Pro00086693). Six participants were either withdrawn by the PI or voluntarily withdrew prior to starting the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects who were on regular inhalation therapies for COPD underwent a wash-out period of 7-14 days, during which time they stopped all inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta agonist (LABA), and long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA). The subjects were allowed to use inhaled albuterol as needed.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Treatment</title>
          <description>Twenty patients with a pulmonologist's diagnosis of either GOLD II or III COPD and no significant comorbidities were recruited. One patient was excluded from data analysis due to poor image signal-to-noise ratio, and two patients did not have both pre- and post-treatment ventilation images; thus, a total of 17 patients (8M; 9F) were included in the data analysis. The mean age was 64.3 ± 4.9.</description>
