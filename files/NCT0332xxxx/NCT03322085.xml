      This study explored the influence of radiofrequency catheter ablation and cryoballoon&#xD;
      ablation on atrial electrical remodeling in patients with atrial fibrillation,the&#xD;
      relationship between atrial electrical remodeling and structural remodeling,and which&#xD;
      indicators are associated with atrial recurrence after catheter ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From September 2017 to September 2019, the investigators enroll consecutive patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) who were scheduled for an initial catheter ablation,&#xD;
      including paroxysmal and persistent AF.Patients are divided in to three group: paroxysmal AF&#xD;
      in radiofrequency ablation group, persistent AF in radiofrequency ablation group, and&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF in Cryoablation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Paroxysmal AF group: The p-wave duration, P wave dispersion and P wave amplitude are&#xD;
           detected before and 24 hours after procedure.The atrial effective refractory period,&#xD;
           refractory period dispersion, frequency adaptation and atrial conduction time were&#xD;
           tested before and after procedure. Detect atrial electromechanical conduction time in&#xD;
           the tissue doppler before and 1 week after procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Persistent AF group: The p-wave duration, P wave dispersion and P wave amplitude are&#xD;
           detected 24 hours after procedure.The atrial effective refractory period, refractory&#xD;
           period dispersion, frequency adaptation and atrial conduction time were tested after&#xD;
           procedure. Detect atrial electromechanical conduction time in the tissue doppler 1 week&#xD;
           after procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Method of detection of atrial electrical remodeling: 1). the measurement of surface&#xD;
           electrocardiogram: the p-wave amplitude, P wave time duration and the p-wave duration&#xD;
           dispersion (dP =Pmax- Pmin) of the same 12 lead electrocardiogram in the same cardiac&#xD;
           cycle.Two cardiologists measured the value separately.The investigators record the mean&#xD;
           value. 2). Atrial effective refractory period (AERP) measured from the high right&#xD;
           atrium(HRA,the junction of superior vena cava and the right atrium , near the sinus&#xD;
           node), low lateral right atrium(LLRA,the junction of inferior vena cava and the right&#xD;
           atrium,on the right atrium free wall side), coronary sinus electrode (CS)7.8, and CS1.2&#xD;
           at 3 basic drive cycle lengths (CLs) of 600, 500, and 400 ms. Pacing was performed using&#xD;
           a pulse width of 2 ms and a current output of twice the local diastolic threshold. If&#xD;
           the latter was 2.0 milliampere (mA), the catheter was replaced and the threshold&#xD;
           repeated. AERP was measured using an 8-beat drive train and a single extrastimulus&#xD;
           incremented by 10 ms from a starting point of 170 ms. Every AERP was repeated 3 times,&#xD;
           and the mean was taken. 3). At each CL, the dispersion of refractoriness was measured by&#xD;
           subtracting the minimum from the maximum AERP across the 4 sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rate adaption of AERP: With the gradual shortening of the pacing cycle lengths, the&#xD;
           atrial effective refractory should be shortened accordingly. The rate adaption of AERP&#xD;
           was observed in different pacing cycle lengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Atrial conduction time measured at the HRA after 30 seconds of constant pacing at a CL&#xD;
           of 600, 500, and 400 ms. Conduction time is measured from the pacing artifact to the&#xD;
           onset of the first initial sharp deflection recorded to the first A wave at CS1.10 and&#xD;
           CS1.2. Total atrial conduction time=Pace HRA-Acs1.2; Right atrial conduction&#xD;
           time=PaceHRA-Acs9.10; Left atrial conduction time=Acs9.10-Acs1.2.6). Atrial&#xD;
           electromechanical conduction time: three sampling points are taken at lateral mitral&#xD;
           valve(Sa1), septal mitral valve(Sa2), lateral tricuspid valve (Sa3), in the tissue&#xD;
           doppler four-chamber view. Atrial electromechanical conduction time is measured from&#xD;
           electrocardiogram P wave initiation to ultrasound A wave initiation. Total atrial&#xD;
           electromechanical conduction time=T1-T3;Right atrial electromechanical conduction&#xD;
           time=T2-T3; Light atrial electromechanical conduction time=T2-T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients fill the follow-up form before procedure. After catheter ablation therapy, all&#xD;
      patients invited to come back to the outpatient clinic every week in the first month, and&#xD;
      then at 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month to follow up. Patients received electrocardiogram and Holter&#xD;
      monitor examination if with symptoms of palpitations. Those patients with no symptoms&#xD;
      received electrocardiogram every month and Holter monitor examination every 6 months.&#xD;
      Recurrence of atrial fibrillation was defined as atrial fibrillation/flutter or atrial&#xD;
      tachycardia lasting ≥ 30 seconds 3 months after radiofrequency catheter ablation therapy.&#xD;
      Patients who have AF recurrence within three months after therapy will not be considered for&#xD;
      repeated radiofrequency ablation.Blood samples (routine blood, high sensitivity c-reactive&#xD;
      protein,B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), cystatin C,homocysteine,β2-microglobulin) and&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography indexes (left atrial anterior to posterior diameter, left&#xD;
      atrial length-diameter,left atrial transverse-diameter,left atrial volume index, mitral e', E&#xD;
      peak, A peak, E/A,velocity time integral (VTI), left atrial ejection fraction, left atrial&#xD;
      strain, strain rate and atrial electrical - mechanical conduction time) are recorded in all&#xD;
      patients at each follow-up. Patients with AF recurrence must have an electrocardiogram or a&#xD;
      24 hour holter monitor evidence.&#xD;
