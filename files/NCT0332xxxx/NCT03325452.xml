  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incidence of non-hospital cardio-respiratory arrest (ACR) in France is around 40 000 cases&#xD;
      per year, with mortality remaining very high, with 75% of patients dying before arrival in&#xD;
      hospital. The investigators know some validated predictive factors for recovery of&#xD;
      spontaneous cardiac activity (RACS) such as age, no flow (time between ACR and onset of CPR),&#xD;
      type of initial electrical activity (FV, TVSP), or the value of CO2 expired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the use of these prognostic criteria in the conduct of CPR maneuvering is in&#xD;
      practice limited. Lactate is now a well-known prognostic biological marker used in many&#xD;
      pathological conditions such as shock states or the severe traumatized patient. Some data&#xD;
      have also demonstrated the prognostic value of lactate on morbidity and mortality after ACR&#xD;
      after resumption of spontaneous cardiac activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of our study is that the evaluation of the initial lactate in the early&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation could be a prognostic factor of RACS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Incidence of non-hospital cardio-respiratory arrest (ACR) in France is around 40 000 cases&#xD;
      per year, with mortality remaining very high, with 75% of patients dying before arrival in&#xD;
      hospital. This disease is associated with a high morbidity since today the investigator find&#xD;
      less than 5% survival at 1 year with a favorable neurological outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendations of ILCOR 2015 underline in this case the importance of implementing&#xD;
      therapeutic measures in the extra-hospital step. Indeed, the survival of ACR patients will&#xD;
      depend mainly on the alert delay at the UAS center, the immediate implementation of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) maneuvers and the early delivery of external electric&#xD;
      shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators know some validated predictive factors for recovery of spontaneous cardiac&#xD;
      activity (RACS) such as age, no flow (time between ACR and onset of CPR), type of initial&#xD;
      electrical activity (FV, TVSP), or the value of CO2 expired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the use of these prognostic criteria in the conduct of CPR maneuvering is in&#xD;
      practice limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, none of these prognostic factors allow us to adapt the cardiopulmonary resuscitation&#xD;
      maneuvers to the different clinical situations, and it is recognized that a CPR must be&#xD;
      carried out for 30 minutes in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of these data, it seemed important to investigate other predictive factors for&#xD;
      RACS, which would remain simple to implement, and allow case-by-case customization the&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactate is now a well-known prognostic biological marker used in many pathological conditions&#xD;
      such as shock states or the severe traumatized patient. Some data have also demonstrated the&#xD;
      prognostic value of lactate on morbidity and mortality after ACR after resumption of&#xD;
      spontaneous cardiac activity. Unfortunately, all of these studies were carried out&#xD;
      intra-hospital. To date, no prospective study has demonstrated the prognostic value of a&#xD;
      lactate assay as soon as the pre-hospital medical team arrives and during pre-hospital&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experimental study published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine in 1985,&#xD;
      however, suggests that early evaluation of lactate in the course of cardiac arrest may be a&#xD;
      valuable prognostic factor. Indeed, in this study on canine cardiac arrest experimental&#xD;
      model, Donna et al found that the lactate concentration would reliably predict the no-flow&#xD;
      describing an linear increase of lactate as a function of the no-flow duration. If these&#xD;
      results can be extrapolated to humans, lactate measurement from the arrival of the&#xD;
      pre-hospital medical team could provide an estimate of the no-flow period and therefore a&#xD;
      reliable and easily reproducible predictive factor for RACS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, improvements in biomedical equipment allow us to perform lactate assays directly&#xD;
      at the patient's bedside, with reliable results in just 13 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of our study is that the evaluation of the initial lactate in the early&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation could be a prognostic factor of RACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the investigators propose to carry out a prospective, open, multicenter&#xD;
      intervention study in different SMURs in the PACA region, in France.&#xD;
