      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pevonedistat when given together&#xD;
      with irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide in treating patients with solid tumors,&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) tumors, or lymphoma that have come back after a period of&#xD;
      improvement (recurrent) or that do not respond to treatment (refractory). Pevonedistat and&#xD;
      irinotecan may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or&#xD;
      by stopping them from spreading. Giving pevonedistat, irinotecan hydrochloride, and&#xD;
      temozolomide may work better in treating patients with solid tumors, central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) tumors, or lymphoma compared to irinotecan and temozolomide alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      pevonedistat administered as an intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, 10, and 12 of a 28-day&#xD;
      cycle (cycle 1), and on days 1, 3, and 5 of a 21-day cycle (cycle 2 and beyond) in&#xD;
      combination with irinotecan (administered as an intravenous infusion on days 8-12 of cycle 1&#xD;
      and days 1-5 of cycles 2+) and temozolomide (administered orally on days 8-12 in cycle 1 and&#xD;
      days 1-5 of cycles 2+) in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) tumors and lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of pevonedistat administered on this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of pevonedistat in children with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of pevonedistat within the confines of a&#xD;
      phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the biologic activity of pevonedistat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of pevonedistat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pevonedistat intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 10, and 12,&#xD;
      temozolomide orally (PO) daily on days 8-12, and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 8-12&#xD;
      of cycle 1. Beginning cycle 2, patients receive pevonedistat IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 3,&#xD;
      and 5, temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5, and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1-5.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for cycle 1 and 21 days for subsequent cycles for up to 17&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
