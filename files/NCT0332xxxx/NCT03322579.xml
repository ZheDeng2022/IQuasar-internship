  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balloon dilatation Eustachian tuboplasty has recently become a promising procedure for the&#xD;
      treatment of refractory dilatory dysfunction of the Eustachian tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eustachian tube (ET) comprises an osseous intratemporal portion and a cartilaginous&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal portion. It functions in pressure equalization, middle ear protection and&#xD;
      clearance. Eustachian tube function can be adversely affected by viral and bacterial&#xD;
      infections, adenoid disease, craniofacial anomalies, neoplasm, genetic predisposition,&#xD;
      sinonasal disease and gastroesophageal reflux, leading to Eustachian tube dysfunction.&#xD;
      Eustachian tuboplasty by balloon dilation involves the recanalization of the cartilaginous&#xD;
      portion of the ET via the nasopharynx with a balloon catheter. This catheter is inflated to&#xD;
      multiple atmospheres of pressure for a short amount of time and then removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical technique, the optimal balloon diameter, pressure or duration of inflation are&#xD;
      variable in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the current data shows promising results and a potential benefit of this&#xD;
      procedure, further evaluation is still needed in order to establish a higher level of&#xD;
      evidence of efficacy and safety.&#xD;

      Balloon dilatation Eustachian tuboplasty has recently become a promising procedure for the&#xD;
      treatment of refractory dilatory dysfunction of the Eustachian tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eustachian tube (ET) comprises an osseous intratemporal portion and a cartilaginous&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal portion. It functions in pressure equalization, middle ear protection and&#xD;
      clearance. Eustachian tube function can be adversely affected by viral and bacterial&#xD;
      infections, adenoid disease, craniofacial anomalies, neoplasm, genetic predisposition,&#xD;
      sinonasal disease and gastroesophageal reflux, leading to Eustachian tube dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      it is now well known that the site of pathology is usually in the cartilaginous portion and&#xD;
      not within the osseus portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic dilatory dysfunction of the Eustachian tube is estimated to be 1% of the adult&#xD;
      population. Current medical and surgical treatment options for this pathophysiological&#xD;
      disorder is still unsatisfactory, including nasal decongestants, topical and systematic&#xD;
      corticosteroids, antihistamines and multiple insertions of ventilation tubes leading to&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ET dysfunction can lead to impaired quality of life due to persistent sensation of ear&#xD;
      fullness, ear pain and inability to tolerate air travel, diving or other activities. With&#xD;
      time, Eustachian tube dysfunction, if left untreated can lead to complications such as&#xD;
      conductive hearing loss and cholesteatoma formation. Recently, numerous researches have&#xD;
      investigated the role of balloon tuboplasty. This procedure aims to ventilate and drain the&#xD;
      middle ear by improving the physiological function of the eustachian tube and treating&#xD;
      chronic refractory eustachian tube dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eustachian tuboplasty by balloon dilation involves the recanalization of the cartilaginous&#xD;
      portion of the ET via the nasopharynx with a balloon catheter. This catheter is inflated to&#xD;
      multiple atmospheres of pressure for a short amount of time and then removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical technique, the optimal balloon diameter, pressure or duration of inflation are&#xD;
      variable in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both cadaveric and clinical studies where done. Cadaveric studies revealed no evidence of&#xD;
      fractures to the cartilaginous or bony lumen, and no damage to the internal carotid artery.&#xD;
      Several clinical studies and many others that confirm the safety of eustachian tube balloon&#xD;
      dilation and consider it as a potential solution for chronic eustachian tube dysfunction. A&#xD;
      systematic review preformed in 2014 showed no adverse outcomes in 103 patients who had&#xD;
      undergone balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube. Another more recent systematic review in&#xD;
      2016 that included nine prospective studies, describing 713 eustachian tube balloon dilations&#xD;
      in 474 patients confirm the safety of eustachian tube balloon dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In September 2016 the ACCLARENT AERAâ„¢ Eustachian Tube Balloon Dilation System, has been&#xD;
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Eustachian Tube&#xD;
      Dysfunction (ETD) and was permitted for marketing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the current data shows promising results and a potential benefit of this&#xD;
      procedure, further evaluation is still needed in order to establish a higher level of&#xD;
      evidence of efficacy and safety.&#xD;
