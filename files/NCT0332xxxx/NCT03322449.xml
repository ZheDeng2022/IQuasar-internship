  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutrients and chemicals in food are able to regulate expression of genetic elements.&#xD;
      Gene-nutrient interaction in response to unhealthy diets can increase an individual's risk,&#xD;
      shifting the individual from health toward the development of chronic disease. The&#xD;
      apolipoprotein A2 (APOA2) gene may either put individuals at risk for or protect from obesity&#xD;
      in the presence of certain fats in food. The main purpose of this four-week study is to&#xD;
      examine diet induced gene-nutrient interaction, with a focus on gut health, gut microbiota&#xD;
      and inflammation in individuals who have either the CC or the TT form within a specific&#xD;
      variant of the APOA2 Gene. The (2) one-week study diets, one plant based and the other animal&#xD;
      based are separated by a (1) week return to your regular habitual without probiotic or&#xD;
      prebiotic food products.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this application are 1. To use a diet intervention setting to&#xD;
      rigorously evaluate the mechanisms responsible for the previously observed effects, focusing&#xD;
      on gut microbiota and markers of gut health and inflammation and 2. To prove that targeted&#xD;
      dietary intervention based on genes can provide additional, tailored benefit to genetically&#xD;
      vulnerable individuals. The overall hypothesis proposes that significant cross-talk between&#xD;
      the human host genome, the microbiome, and the diet, defines the observed inter-individual&#xD;
      variation in metabolic and physiological responses. Accordingly, the investigators propose&#xD;
      the following specific aims and hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To catalog the response of the plasma metabolome to diets differing in saturated fat&#xD;
      and prebiotics content (animal-based diet versus plant-based diet) in individuals from the&#xD;
      USA carrying CC (n=20) and TT (n=20) genotypes at the common APOA2 -265T&gt;C SNP using a&#xD;
      crossover, randomized dietary intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis states: A significant and biologically relevant proportion of the&#xD;
      individual variation in changes in the plasma metabolome in response to dietary saturated fat&#xD;
      and prebiotic intake will be due to APOA2-265T&gt;C genotypes. Specifically, subjects homozygous&#xD;
      (CC) for the less common C allele will respond to decreases in total dietary saturated fat&#xD;
      and increases in prebiotics (i.e., plant-based diet) with significantly greater improvement&#xD;
      of metabolites related to gut health, inflammation and other cardiometabolic traits than&#xD;
      subjects homozygous (TT) for the common T allele.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To characterize differential impacts of low SFA/high prebiotic (plant-based) diet vs.&#xD;
      high SFA/low prebiotic (animal-based) diets on gut microbiota patterns between CC and TT&#xD;
      persons at APOA2-265T&gt;C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis states: CC subjects have a preference for high-fat and -protein foods&#xD;
      and therefore high levels of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and similar species in the gut are&#xD;
      expected. Moreover, reducing intake of saturated fat and increasing prebiotics will be more&#xD;
      effective in inducing a healthier gut microflora profile in CC subjects than in those with&#xD;
      the TT genotype, with opposite effects observed when the diet is switched to one high in&#xD;
      saturated fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: To integrate the metabolomic and gut microflora taxonomic information generated in&#xD;
      AIM1 and AIM2 in order to elucidate the physiological mechanism(s) by which diet impinges on&#xD;
      metabolic pathways through APOA2 genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis states: A diet low in saturated fat and high in prebiotics induces&#xD;
      beneficial changes in gut microbiota, metabolic processes and inflammation, which are&#xD;
      significantly more pronounced in CC than in TT subjects.&#xD;
