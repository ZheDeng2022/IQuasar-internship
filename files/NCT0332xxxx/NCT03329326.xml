  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and rational:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large number of instruments exists to assess upper limb prosthetic function. However, they&#xD;
      differ substantially in terms of psychometric properties and content. Furthermore, there is&#xD;
      no &quot;gold standard&quot; and nearly every single center uses a unique set of instruments. This fact&#xD;
      prevents the linking of the commonly small (due to the limited number of patients in each&#xD;
      center) data sets of different centers and makes comparisons between different fittings or&#xD;
      treatment protocols difficult. To generate accepted evidence, we need large data sets with&#xD;
      similar outcomes. With remarkable progress made in prosthetic research and rehabilitation in&#xD;
      the recent years, the need to evaluate the impact of this intervention on daily life,&#xD;
      including productivity, self-care and leisure becomes increasingly relevant. Moreover,&#xD;
      self-reported instruments and observation-based instruments exist, but there is a lack of&#xD;
      data if, for example, the self-reported instrument (which is easier and less&#xD;
      health-professional's-time-consuming to perform) could &quot;replace&quot; a performance or&#xD;
      observation-based instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine psychometric properties of the existing&#xD;
      instruments (SHAP, DASH, SF-36 and ACMC) in a large international data set, to explore&#xD;
      possible linkage between self-reported and performance or observation-based instruments and&#xD;
      to develop state-of-the art recommendations/points to consider on how to assess functioning&#xD;
      in prosthetic care.&#xD;

      instruments in a large international data set, to explore possible linkage between&#xD;
      self-reported and performance or observation-based instruments and to develop state-of-the&#xD;
      art recommendations/points to consider on how to assess functioning in prosthetic care.&#xD;
      Projects exploring outcome assessments should have a broad basis and target different patient&#xD;
      populations. To be able to generalize the outcome of the study for the European population,&#xD;
      this study is planned as a multi-centre study. Also, having a sufficient number of subjects&#xD;
      to calculate statistical relationships is otherwise not possible due the limited number of&#xD;
      patients being treated at most centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age: 16-85 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  major uni-lateral amputation of the upper extremity (includes amputation of the hand,&#xD;
           forearm, upper arm and at shoulder level)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  normal hand function of the other side (in case of doubt: SHAP score ≥ 95)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no major neurologic or untreated psychological disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fitted with an active prosthesis (myo, body-powered or hybrid) for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Used Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP): The Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure&#xD;
           (SHAP) is a clinically validated hand function test developed to assess the&#xD;
           effectiveness of upper limb prostheses. The SHAP is made up of 6 abstract objects and 14&#xD;
           Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Each task is timed by the participant, so there is no&#xD;
           interference or reliability on the reaction times of the observer or clinician. The SHAP&#xD;
           Index of Function score is used for comparison, which is a number that provides an&#xD;
           overall assessment of hand function. SHAP scores do not plateau at 100, instead scores&#xD;
           greater than 100 can be achieved if a participant is exceptionally quick at a given task&#xD;
           or series of tasks. Scores less than 100 are an indication of how impaired a&#xD;
           participant's hand function is. In general, scores between 95 and 105 are considered&#xD;
           normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (DASH): The DASH is a&#xD;
           questionnaire, where patients are asked to rate their (bimanual) performance in daily&#xD;
           life. It has been validated for use in patients with musculoskeletal diseases and&#xD;
           injuries to the arm. A score of 100 indicates the worst and 0 indicates the best hand&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Form -36 Quality of Life Questionnaire (SF-36): We will use the SF-36 Health&#xD;
           Survey 4-week recall version. The questionnaire addresses eight independent subscales:&#xD;
           physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality,&#xD;
           social role functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health. Each subscale&#xD;
           ranges from 0 to 100. Based on the subscales, two superior physical and mental component&#xD;
           summary scales can be identified. These have mean values of 50 and an SD of 10. A&#xD;
           (German) patient with a psychological sum scale of 65 exhibits above average mental&#xD;
           health compared with age-matched and sex-matched Germans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open questions concerning demographic data and prosthesis-related questions (~15): These&#xD;
           questions are used to determine further factors that may influence the outcome of&#xD;
           self-rated and performance-based tests. They include factors that are already known to&#xD;
           influence upper extremity function or perceived disability (e.g rate at amputation, time&#xD;
           since amputation, dominant vs. non-dominant hand), as well as factors that may influence&#xD;
           the outcome, but were not studied before in sufficient detail (as living alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of Capacity of Myoelectric control (ACMC): The &quot;Assessment of Capacity for&#xD;
           Myoelectric Control&quot; (ACMC) is an observational assessment developed to assess the&#xD;
           ability of a prosthesis user to control a myoelectric prosthetic hand. Each item in the&#xD;
           ACMC is an observable prosthetic hand movement, such as timing during grasping, or an&#xD;
           observable prosthetic hand movement in relation to other body parts, such as uses the&#xD;
           prosthesis over the shoulder. The ACMC assesses how skillful a prosthesis hand user&#xD;
           performs different prosthetic hand movements when performing a bimanual activity. To&#xD;
           perform the ACMC, a two-day training course is required. As not all participating&#xD;
           centres have trained professionals, the use of the ACMC is not mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As this is a cross-sectional study, all assessments are performed at one point in time&#xD;
           (maximum of 2 months in between the different assessments).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participating centers can collect all data by themselves and send (anonymized) data&#xD;
           sets to the Medical University of Vienna (MUV). Otherwise, they can invite patients and&#xD;
           an experienced physical therapist from MUV will visit the center to do the assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions and statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine psychometric properties of the existing instruments in a large&#xD;
           international data set --&gt; Linkage of data from different centers, psychometric&#xD;
           properties; planned analyses: descriptive statistics, correlation, principal components&#xD;
           analyses and Rasch analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore possible linkage between self-reported and performance or observation-based&#xD;
           instruments. planned analyses: Regression analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop state-of-the art points to consider on how to assess functioning in&#xD;
           prosthetic care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to get a (representative) sample of the European prosthesis using&#xD;
      population, which presents the major the reason for the multi-centre study design. The&#xD;
      planned sample size is 100-200 amputees fitted with an active prosthesis. This number should&#xD;
      alow proper statistic calculations of the influence of the co-variants, but also be feasible&#xD;
      with the number of centres participating.&#xD;
