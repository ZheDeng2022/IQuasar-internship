  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the relationship of tissue oxygenation of different organs and tissue beds&#xD;
      (e.g., a tissue bed on the arm vs. leg vs. flank tissue bed(s) and renal tissue bed, and thus&#xD;
      can be used as a surrogate of renal tissue oxygenation monitoring.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will monitor tissue oxygenation of four different tissue beds including&#xD;
      cerebral tissue (SctO2) on the forehead, and 3 somatic tissue beds monitored on the forearm&#xD;
      (SarmO2), upper leg (SlegO2), and the renal region (SrrO2). The primary end point is AKI and&#xD;
      the secondary end points are postoperative major non-renal complications (e.g. stroke,&#xD;
      delirium, myocardial infraction, heart failure, new or worsening arrhythmia, mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation &gt; 24 hours, deep wound infection, etc.) and mortality. The associations between&#xD;
      tissue oxygenation of different tissue beds, i.e. SctO2, SarmO2, SlegO2, and SrrO2, and AKI&#xD;
      and non-renal outcomes will be compared to explore the tissue bed(s) whose oxygen saturation&#xD;
      has a stronger association with the outcomes of interest. The strength of this study is to&#xD;
      use the patient as self-control.&#xD;
