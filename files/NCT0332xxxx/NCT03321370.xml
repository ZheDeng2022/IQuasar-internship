      novel algorithms to determine cortical spreading depolarization foci of origination following&#xD;
      severe traumatic brain injury requiring neurosurgical intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to improve our understanding of cortical spreading depolarizations&#xD;
      (CSDs) as a mechanism of secondary injury in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The primary&#xD;
      obstacles to advancing treatment of TBI are its heterogeneity in terms of cause, severity,&#xD;
      pathophysiology and the paucity of therapeutic targets. At the current time, there is no&#xD;
      intervention to reverse or restore the function of brain tissue damaged or lost during the&#xD;
      initial traumatic insult; therefore the therapeutic focus is centered on minimizing secondary&#xD;
      insults that result in expansion of the initial brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The past several years have witnessed significant advancement in the understanding of&#xD;
      potential mechanisms of secondary injury after severe TBI. This is important work as&#xD;
      secondary injury after severe TBI is thought to significantly increase the severity of the&#xD;
      initial injury and this type of injury is thought to be open to interventions to attenuate&#xD;
      the subsequent injury severity. Among the putative mechanisms of secondary injury after&#xD;
      severe TBI, it was recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between CSD events and&#xD;
      worse outcomes after severe TBI. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of the factors that&#xD;
      influence the initiation and frequency of CSDs after TBI is warranted in order to develop&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies to reduce or block these events from occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In young people, TBI is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries.&#xD;
      TBI is a frequent sequelae of accidental injury in the USA with approximately 2.5 million&#xD;
      people affected per year, approximately 10% of whom requiring extended hospitalization, often&#xD;
      in an intensive care unit. Around 275,000 (15.1%) of hospital admissions and 52,000 deaths in&#xD;
      the USA each year are due to TBI. Those that survive the initial insult invariably face&#xD;
      prolonged stays in a neurologic intensive care unit (ICU), possible neurosurgical&#xD;
      intervention, and prolonged period of post-acute supportive care. In the US, it is estimated&#xD;
      that 5.3 million individuals are living with long-term disability as a result of TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the complexity and duration of medical care that accompanies severe TBI, it follows&#xD;
      that the cost of care associated with TBI are immense. It is estimated that total hospital&#xD;
      charges for TBI-related admissions in 2010 were $21.4 billion. Beyond hospital charges, it is&#xD;
      estimated that TBI costs the US economy $76.5 billion annually with the costs for disability&#xD;
      and lost productivity outweighing those of acute medical care and rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since their first description in 1944, spreading depolarizations (SDs) were subsequently&#xD;
      demonstrated in numerous animal studies as a mechanism of secondary brain injury after&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and traumatic brain injury. SDs have also&#xD;
      been demonstrated to occur in the cerebral grey matter of the human brain in patients after&#xD;
      acute brain injuries such as TBI, SAH, and ischemic stroke. To date, electrocorticography&#xD;
      (ECoG) monitoring of over 500 patients after TBI has shown that SDs occur in 55-90% of&#xD;
      individuals for days to weeks after the initial injury. These studies have demonstrated an&#xD;
      initial peak in SD frequency at 1-2 days post-TBI and a second peak at 6-7 days. Furthermore,&#xD;
      SDs are associated with worse outcomes after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SDs which consist of massive waves that depolarize neurons and astrocytes and disrupt local&#xD;
      cortical function for minutes to hours, were first demonstrated to occur in severe TBI&#xD;
      patients via ECoG recordings obtained from single subdural electrode strips. In these&#xD;
      studies, severe TBI patients who underwent neurosurgical intervention for decompression&#xD;
      and/or hematoma evacuation had a single linear subdural electrode strips (six electrodes with&#xD;
      10 mm spacing between electrodes) placed near the injury epicenter which allowed continuous&#xD;
      ECoG recordings to be obtained for up to 7 days after the initial injury. The above studies,&#xD;
      and several subsequent investigations, were important steps to demonstrate that (1) the SD&#xD;
      phenomena, which was first described in animal studies, occurs in patients after TBI and (2)&#xD;
      SDs are associated with worse outcome after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the advances that have been made, previous studies discontinued ECoG recordings after&#xD;
      a maximum of 7 days. A 7 day recording period is, however, likely inadequate to accurately&#xD;
      characterize the total burden of SDs following TBI as previous work demonstrates an early&#xD;
      peak period of SDs around 0-2 days post-TBI followed by a relative quiescent period and then&#xD;
      a second peak of increased SD frequency around 7 days post-TBI. Therefore, a longer&#xD;
      recordings period will provide a better understanding of the natural history of SDs following&#xD;
      TBI and allow a more accurate understanding of the physiologic and pathophysiologic factors&#xD;
      that influence initiation of these pathologic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All prior ECoG recordings of SDs has relied on subdural electrode strips consisting of a&#xD;
      linear array of electrodes placed over the cerebral cortex near contused brain tissue. This&#xD;
      recordings strategy is adequate to capture SD events, however, it affords the ability to&#xD;
      monitor a small area of the cortical surface. The small monitoring area imposed several&#xD;
      limitations on previous studies. First, CSDs are captured within a limited distance of each&#xD;
      recording electrode contact. CSDs that occur beyond the monitoring region are not recorded&#xD;
      and, therefore, prior studies likely underestimate the true frequency of SD events after TBI.&#xD;
      Second, the linear configuration of subdural strips does not provide adequate spatial&#xD;
      information regarding the CSD waves to determine the origin or direction of propagation.&#xD;
      Improved spatial resolution of the ECoG recordings in conjunction with appropriate analytic&#xD;
      techniques will allow determination of the direction of SD wave propagation and possibly the&#xD;
      identification of pathologic foci where SDs originate. Identification of where SDs originate&#xD;
      will afford the ability to correlate these locations with imaging to determine the structural&#xD;
      characteristics and pathology that give rise to this pathological phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to preliminarily evaluate an improved recording strategy&#xD;
      and analytical techniques to better define SD events and structural abnormalities in the&#xD;
      severely injured brain that produce these CSD events in severe TBI. In order to achieve this&#xD;
      goal, this study will utilize 4 subdural electrode strips arranged to produce a 4x4 grid of&#xD;
      electrode contacts for the recording of ECoG activity in conjunction with simultaneous&#xD;
      acquisition of several other physiological measures in TBI patients requiring neurosurgical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this study could provide a key advancement in the means to both monitor CSD&#xD;
      events after TBI and identify the specific types of pathology that give rise to these events.&#xD;
      This would be an important next step in the development of new interventions to reduce or&#xD;
      eliminate the frequency of SDs in TBI patients and thus the degree of secondary brain injury&#xD;
      that leads to greater morbidity and mortality after severe brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances that have been made in the care of patients after severe brain injury, TBI&#xD;
      continues to confer a very high morbidity and mortality. The development of effective&#xD;
      treatments to minimize the morbidity and mortality following TBI has been hindered due to a&#xD;
      fundamental lack of understanding of the factors that contribute to secondary injury after&#xD;
      the initial inciting traumatic event. By better understanding mechanisms of secondary brain&#xD;
      injury after TBI, such as CSD, as well as methods for monitoring for pathologic events, there&#xD;
      will be more opportunities to develop new treatments. This is a preliminary study with the&#xD;
      goal of better characterizing CSD following severe TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subdural electrodes have been used extensively to record ECoG activity following TBI and&#xD;
      other forms of brain injury. Despite requiring an invasive form of recording, ECoG activity&#xD;
      remains the only established means to monitor CSD events. Invasive neuromonitoring via&#xD;
      subdural electrodes was first demonstrated in the 1930s and continues to be a commonly&#xD;
      performed neurosurgical procedure for epilepsy monitoring. A recent retrospective review&#xD;
      found an overall complication rate of approximately 9.1% with 0.6% of patients experiencing&#xD;
      permanent neurological deficits following subdural electrode placement.19 Furthermore, there&#xD;
      has not been a single infection associated with subdural electrode placement at the&#xD;
      University of Minnesota Medical Center. In addition to allowing detection of CSD events,&#xD;
      subdural electrodes will allow the identification of subclinical seizures, and, therefore may&#xD;
      provide a clinical benefit to the patients who undergo subdural electrode recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in this study will be selected from patients requiring neurosurgical&#xD;
      intervention in the form of craniectomy or craniotomy and, therefore, will not be exposed to&#xD;
      an invasive procedure solely for the placement of subdural recording electrodes. During the&#xD;
      standard craniectomy/craniotomy procedure, the dura is opened to expose allowing the&#xD;
      placement of the subdural recording strips with minimal modification to the standard surgical&#xD;
      procedure. After the subdural strips are placed, the leads will be tunneled away from the&#xD;
      brain so that they exit away from the brain, minimizing infection risk. This approach has the&#xD;
      added benefit that when the study period is over, the tunneled leads can be removed at the&#xD;
      bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to ECoG recordings, other forms of invasive neuromonitoring, including Licox bolt&#xD;
      (Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro, New Jersey) for measurement of ICP, brain tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation and temperature, as well as external ventricular drain (EVD) will be placed as&#xD;
      part of the current standard of care treatment for severe TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will be as long as invasive neuromonitoring is clinically indicated&#xD;
      following severe TBI. As outlined in the background section, previous investigations of CSD&#xD;
      have ended after a 7-day recording period. The shorter recording period has likely hindered a&#xD;
      full understanding of the natural history of CSDs following severe TBI and therefore a full&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiological factors that produce these events. There will be&#xD;
      minimal additional risk to extending the recording period to the full period of clinically&#xD;
      indicated invasive neuromonitoring as subdural recording is routinely performed at the&#xD;
      University of Minnesota for epilepsy monitoring for 4-6 weeks without a documented serious&#xD;
      complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) is a regional level 1 trauma center that serves the&#xD;
      upper midwest and is one of the training sites for the University of Minnesota Neurosurgery&#xD;
      Residency Program. As a large regional trauma center, there has historically been a large&#xD;
      volume of severe TBI patients requiring neurosurgical intervention in the form of craniectomy&#xD;
      or craniotomy with subsequent prolonged invasive neuromonitoring necessary as part of the&#xD;
      clinical standard of care. The study population will be drawn from all trauma patients who&#xD;
      present to the HCMC Emergency Department, trauma bay or as direct transfer to neurosurgery.&#xD;
