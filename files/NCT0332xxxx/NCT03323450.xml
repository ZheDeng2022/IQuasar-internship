  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate a computer-based Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) for brain tumor patients&#xD;
      at the Massey Cancer Center on measures of cognitive functioning (e.g., working memory,&#xD;
      attention, processing speed, language, visuospatial functioning, immediate and delayed&#xD;
      memory, or executive functioning) over time.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited by their neuropsychologist in the VCU Massey Cancer Center&#xD;
      following standard neuropsychological evaluation (their neuro-oncologist may refer them to&#xD;
      this study). If meeting inclusion criteria (described in later sections on participants),&#xD;
      participants will be recruited and enrolled in the study. Two groups will be formed: High&#xD;
      grade gliomas (WHO grade III or IV; n=15) and Low grade gliomas (WHO grade II; n=15).&#xD;
      Participants will be followed over 11 months. The two groups will follow identical study&#xD;
      timelines.&#xD;
