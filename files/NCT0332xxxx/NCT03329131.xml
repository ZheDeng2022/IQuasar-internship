      This is a therapeutic study investigating the use of cryotherapy in the prevention of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and associated nail toxicities. The&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention will involve patients wearing an Elasto-Gel cold glove and sock on&#xD;
      one hand and one foot (both on the right side or both on the left side). The patients will&#xD;
      wear the glove and sock during each infusion of taxane chemotherapy.&#xD;
