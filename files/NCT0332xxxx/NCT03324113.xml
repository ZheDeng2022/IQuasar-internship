      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate tolerability and safety of SAR408701 when administered as a single agent&#xD;
           according to the investigational medicinal product (IMP) related dose limiting&#xD;
           toxicities (DLTs) to determine the recommended dose (RD) of SAR408701 in Japanese&#xD;
           patients with advanced malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the overall safety profile of SAR408701 monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR408701 and its metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PDy) effect of SAR408701 on levels of circulating&#xD;
           carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) for main dose&#xD;
           escalation part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess preliminary efficacy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor&#xD;
           (RECIST) 1.1 criteria and other indicators of antitumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the potential immunogenicity of SAR408701.&#xD;

      The study duration per participant will include a period to assess eligibility (screening&#xD;
      period) of up to approximately 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period and an End-of-Treatment&#xD;
      (EOT) visit around 30 days after the last administration of IMP, and at least one follow-up&#xD;
      (FU) visit after the EOT visit.&#xD;
