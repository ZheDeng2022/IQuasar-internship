    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study is intended to assess the clinical lot-to-lot consistency in manufacturing&#xD;
      by evaluating and comparing the immunogenicity of three consecutively manufactured lots of&#xD;
      the Quadrivalent Virus-Like Particles (VLP) Influenza Vaccine, during the 2016-2017 influenza&#xD;
      season, in healthy adults 18-49 years of age. A single dose of one of three consecutive lots&#xD;
      of Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine (30 µg/strain) will be administered to 1,200 subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized, observer-blind, multicenter, Phase 3 lot consistency study will be conducted&#xD;
      at multiple sites in Canada. The composition of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine used&#xD;
      in this study includes two influenza A virus strains and two influenza B virus strains based&#xD;
      on the 2016-2017 recommended strains for vaccination in the Northern hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1,200 healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 49 years will be randomized in a 1:1:1&#xD;
      ratio to one of three lots of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine (30 μg/strain). Subjects&#xD;
      will participate in this study for approximately 21 days, during which a first visit will be&#xD;
      scheduled on Day 0 for screening, eligibility assessment, and vaccine administration; and on&#xD;
      Day 21 for blood sample collection for immunogenicity assessment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation&#xD;
        in this study; no protocol waivers are allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must be able to read, understand, and sign the informed consent form (ICF);&#xD;
             complete study-related procedures; and communicate with the study staff at visits and&#xD;
             by phone;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be considered by the Investigator to be reliable and likely to cooperate&#xD;
             with the assessment procedures and be available for the duration of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male and female subjects must be 18 to 49 years of age, inclusive, at the&#xD;
             Screening/Vaccination visit (Visit 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects have a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 40.0 kg/m2 on Day 0 pre-vaccination;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be in good general health prior to study participation with no&#xD;
             clinically relevant abnormalities that could jeopardize subject safety or interfere&#xD;
             with study assessments as assessed by the Principal Investigator or sub-Investigator&#xD;
             (thereafter referred as Investigator) and determined by medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, and vital signs; Note: Subjects with a pre-existing chronic disease will&#xD;
             be allowed to participate if the disease is stable and, according to the&#xD;
             Investigator's judgment, the condition is unlikely to confound the results of the&#xD;
             study or pose additional risk to the subject by participating in the study. Stable&#xD;
             disease is generally defined as no new onset or exacerbation of pre-existing chronic&#xD;
             disease six months prior to vaccination. Based on the Investigator's judgment, a&#xD;
             subject with a more recent stabilization of a disease could also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subjects must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at the&#xD;
             Screening/Vaccination visit (Visit 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must use an effective method of&#xD;
             contraception for one month prior to vaccination and agree to continue employing&#xD;
             adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study. Abstinent subjects&#xD;
             should be asked what method(s) they would use, should their circumstances change, and&#xD;
             subjects without a well-defined plan should be excluded. The following relationship or&#xD;
             methods of contraception are considered to be effective:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal contraceptives (e.g. oral, injectable, topical [patch], or estrogenic&#xD;
                  vaginal ring);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intra-uterine device with or without hormonal release;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male partner using a condom plus spermicide or a sterilized partner (at least one&#xD;
                  year prior to vaccination);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Credible self-reported history of heterosexual vaginal intercourse abstinence&#xD;
                  until at least the Day 21 visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Non-childbearing females are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Surgically-sterile (defined as bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy performed more than one month prior to vaccination); or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-menopausal (absence of menses for 24 consecutive months and age consistent&#xD;
                  with natural cessation of ovulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participating in this&#xD;
        study; no protocol waivers are allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. According to the Investigator's opinion, history of significant acute or chronic,&#xD;
             uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric illness. 'Uncontrolled' is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment during the six months prior to&#xD;
                  study vaccine administration unless the criteria outlined in inclusion criterion&#xD;
                  no. 5 can be met (i.e. the Investigator can justify inclusion based upon the&#xD;
                  innocuous nature of medical/surgical events and/or treatments);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Requiring any significant change in a chronic medication (i.e. drug, dose,&#xD;
                  frequency) during the three months prior to study vaccine administration due to&#xD;
                  uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity, unless the innocuous nature of the&#xD;
                  medication change meets the criteria outlined in inclusion criterion no. 5 and is&#xD;
                  appropriately justified by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use or&#xD;
             drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject unable to&#xD;

             trivalent/quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine by either intradermal or&#xD;
             intramuscular (IM) route) within 24 months prior to randomization and up to completion&#xD;
             of the Day 21 visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             randomization or planned use during the study period. Subjects may not participate in&#xD;
             any other investigational or marketed drug study while participating in this study&#xD;
             until the Day 21 visit. Participation in observational studies is permitted;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids at a dose exceeding 10 mg of prednisone (or&#xD;
             the equivalent) per day for more than seven consecutive days or for ten or more days&#xD;
             in total, within one month of study vaccine administration; or any other cytotoxic or&#xD;
             immunosuppressant drug, or any immunoglobulin preparation within three months of&#xD;
             vaccination and until the completion of the Day 21 visit. Low doses of nasal or&#xD;
             inhaled glucocorticoids and topical steroids are permitted;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any significant disorder of coagulation including, but not limited to, treatment with&#xD;
             warfarin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic anti-platelet&#xD;
             medications (e.g. low-dose aspirin [no more than 325 mg/day]) and without a clinically&#xD;
             apparent bleeding tendency are eligible. Subjects treated with new generation drugs&#xD;
             that do not increase the risk of IM bleeding (e.g. clopidogrel) are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of allergy to any of the constituents of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza&#xD;
             Vaccine or a tobacco allergy;&#xD;
