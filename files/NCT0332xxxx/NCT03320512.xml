  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      P3 (Prepared, Protected, emPowered) is an interactive smartphone app for HIV-uninfected YMSM&#xD;
      and YTW that utilizes social networking and game-based mechanics as well as a comprehensive&#xD;
      understanding of what constitutes &quot;best practices&quot; in app development to improve PrEP&#xD;
      adherence and persistence in PrEP care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sustainable, integrated PrEP adherence interventions are critically needed to reduce HIV&#xD;
      incidence among YMSM and YTW. It is imperative that the investigators develop adherence&#xD;
      interventions for YMSM and YTW initiating PrEP that are engaging, age-appropriate and take&#xD;
      advantage of technologies that are already embedded in these individual's lives. A&#xD;
      smartphone-delivered PrEP adherence intervention is well suited for this population, given&#xD;
      they have a high-uptake and utilization of smartphone technology. The use of smartphones to&#xD;
      deliver HIV prevention and care interventions has grown substantially in recent years due to:&#xD;
      a) wide-scale adoption of smartphone technology among high-risk groups, b) the ability to&#xD;
      deliver interventions in real-time within risk contexts, and c) low implementation costs.The&#xD;
      accessibility, affordability, anonymity and acceptability of smartphones make them the&#xD;
      intervention medium of choice for engaging youth and a logical platform to deliver an&#xD;
      adherence intervention targeting PrEP. Further, smartphone interventions address can overcome&#xD;
      issues that impede engagement with in-person interventions such as transportation logistics,&#xD;
      stigma and confidentiality. Further youth, including YMSM and YTW are receptive to smartphone&#xD;
      delivered interventions and these interventions can impact HIV related prevention behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P3 (Prepared, Protected, emPowered) is an interactive smartphone app for HIV-uninfected YMSM&#xD;
      and YTW that utilizes social networking and game-based mechanics as well as a comprehensive&#xD;
      understanding of what constitutes &quot;best practices&quot; in app development to improve PrEP&#xD;
      adherence and persistence in PrEP care. Built on a successful, evidence-based platform&#xD;
      designed and tested by our collaborating technology partner, Ayogo, P3 is flexible and&#xD;
      responsive to changes in technology. This flexibility will also allow us to quickly respond&#xD;
      to and modify our intervention to align with emerging PrEP practice standards and guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the benefits of app-based interventions, maintaining engagement over time can be&#xD;
      particularly challenging. Lack of rapport building may contribute to lower retention rates in&#xD;
      technology-based interventions. Further, the available literature suggests that some tools,&#xD;
      including technology based tools, may be more beneficial to patient adherence when combined&#xD;
      with education or counseling. To investigate this possibility, the investigators will include&#xD;
      a study arm (P3+) that includes P3 and adherence counseling delivered by a counselor through&#xD;
      the P3 app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has three phases, usability testing, field testing, and a randomized-controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT). In usability testing the investigators will test beta versions of the app and&#xD;
      gain feedback about the intervention from the target population, identify any technical&#xD;
      issues, and get feedback on app content. Field testing is to ensure that the features,&#xD;
      platform and content of P3 and P3+ are acceptable to the target population and that there are&#xD;
      no technical challenges or user concerns with either the app, the dried blood spot (DBS),&#xD;
      hair, or mitra sampling collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last phase is a three arm, RCT that will test the efficacy of P3, a novel, theory-based&#xD;
      mobile app that utilizes game mechanics and social networking features to improve PrEP&#xD;
      adherence, retention in PrEP clinical care, and PrEP persistence among young men who have sex&#xD;
      with men (YMSM) and young trans women (YTW) who have sex with men, ages 16-24. The&#xD;
      investigators will test the efficacy of P3 and P3+, which adds Next Step Counseling delivered&#xD;
      by an adherence counselor through the app, against PrEP standard of care. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to P3, P3+, or standard of care. A cost comparison between P3 and P3+ will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;

Study arms will include P3, P3+, and standard of care (SOC). Participants will be recruited from seven cities. The investigators will enroll up to 240 participants and randomize them 2:2:1 to receive P3, P3+, or SOC. Assessments will be completed at months 0, 3, and 6.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In P3+, participants receive all of P3 and the ability to text in the app with an adherence counselor, using Next Step Counseling (NSC). NSC is an interactive, client-centered motivational intervention to improve PrEP adherence. Key components of NSC include: review experiences with adherence, exploration of adherence facilitators and barriers, identification of adherence needs, identification of strategies to meet needs, and development of an adherence action plan. Participants will install P3+ on their phone. The adherence counselor feature will be unlocked for those in the P3+ arm. P3+ participants will have 24-hour access to all features of P3+.</description>
