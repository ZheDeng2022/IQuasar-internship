  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary neurological disorders are relatively common in paediatric neurological practice,&#xD;
      but it has considerable overlap with adult neurological disorders. It is a group of of&#xD;
      genetic diseases, most of which with a Mendelian inheritance affecting neurological system.&#xD;
      Pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases are not fully understood. There is currently no&#xD;
      effective therapy for most of these diseases. Disease-specific and patient- specific iPS&#xD;
      cells would provide useful source of cells in culture modeling in these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, disease-specific iPS cell lines repositories from hereditary neurological&#xD;
      disease patients will be established. The cell lines will be registered and make them&#xD;
      available to other investigators.&#xD;

      The human iPS is generated by direct reprogramming of human somatic cells. These hiPS cells&#xD;
      can give rise to most tissue types in the human embryo and possess many of the properties of&#xD;
      human embryonic stem cells (hESC). The big advantage of human iPS cell over hESC is that it&#xD;
      circumvents most of the limitations of hESC and remains the pluripotency for regeneration of&#xD;
      cells and tissues. The unique capacity of self-renewal of iPS can provide unlimited supply of&#xD;
      pluripotent stem cells for study. The patient-specific iPS cell lines should fundamentally&#xD;
      eliminate the concern of immune rejection and ethical issues. The disease-specific iPS will&#xD;
      facilitate the study of the mechanism of nucleotide expansion. It is the ideal medium to&#xD;
      study the dynamic changes of the expansion from stem cell stage to different differentiation&#xD;
      stages. It also creates a platform for drug development. The establishment of iPS stem cells&#xD;
      will also make it realistic for target gene replacement/correction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be identified at the members from the Hong Kong Spinocerebellar ataxias&#xD;
      (SCA) association and neurology clinic in Prince of Wales Hospital. Patients identify based&#xD;
      on the diagnosis, genetic test results and inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10ml blood sample for genetic screening will be collected. Skin biopsy will only be scheduled&#xD;
      if pathogenic mutation was identified by the genetic screening test and generation of iPS is&#xD;
      considered necessary to study the pathogenic mechanism of the disease.&#xD;
