      Multicenter open-label, phase II trial, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nal-IRI in&#xD;
      patients with HER2-negative breast cancer, who have documented Central Nervous System (CNS)&#xD;
      progression following Whole Brain Radio Therapy (WBRT), Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)&#xD;
      and/or surgery, as determined by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases&#xD;
      (RANO-BM) criteria.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, prospective, open-label, multicenter, single arm, two-stage Simon&#xD;
      Design phase II clinical trial, with the primary objective of assessing the efficacy of&#xD;
      nal-IRI single agent in a cohort of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients&#xD;
      with CNS involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have histologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast,&#xD;
      they must have progressed to at least one prior chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic&#xD;
      setting and must have been progressed in CNS to previous local treatment (Surgery and/or WBRT&#xD;
      and/or SRS) showing at least one measurable lesion in the CNS (symptomatic meningeal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis is not permitted). Eligible patients must have been previously received at&#xD;
      least treatment with taxanes (either in the neo/adjuvant or in the metastatic scenario).&#xD;
      Patients could not be eligible if they are candidates for a local treatment with a radical&#xD;
      intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be accrued in a two-stage design. Considering a drop-out rate of 10%, the&#xD;
      accrual goal will be a total of 63 patients in both stages (first stage will include 23&#xD;
      evaluable patients and the second stage will include 33 more evaluable patients).&#xD;

    <description>The efficacy of nal-IRI will be measured in terms of CNS ORR, defined as per RANO-BM criteria.

Partial Response (PR) will be defined as a decrease of at least 30% in the sum longest diameter (LD) of CNS target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD, sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; no corticosteroids; stable or improved clinically.</description>
