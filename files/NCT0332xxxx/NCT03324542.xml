      Purpose To report the long-term efficacy of patients with neovascular age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration (nAMD) treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in Changhua&#xD;
      Christian Hospital in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Retrospective case series of patients with nAMD that were treated with intravitreal&#xD;
      injection of anti-VEGF and had a minimum follow up of 48 months. Every patient was initially&#xD;
      treated with 3 loading doses of either bevacizumab or ranibizumab, followed by a loose treat&#xD;
      and extend regimen. Eyes were divided into 2 groups according to whether aflibercept was&#xD;
      later used as a rescue therapy (group 2) or not (group 1). Patients underwent best-corrected&#xD;
      visual acuity (BCVA) testing, optical coherence tomography, and ophthalmic examination at&#xD;
      baseline and all the scheduled follow-up visits.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is one of the most common&#xD;
      disorders that cause irreversible blindness in the senior population in the developed world.&#xD;
      If left untreated the patients may experience gradual central visual impairment and&#xD;
      metamorphopsia which could severely affect their quality of life. However, with the&#xD;
      development and application of intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF), the visual prognosis of nAMD has been greatly improved.Currently there are&#xD;
      three commonly prescribed anti-VEGF agents. Aflibercept (Eylea; Regeneron Pharma, Tarrytown,&#xD;
      New York, USA; Bayer, Basel, Switzerland), ranibizumab (Lucentis; Novartis Pharma, Basel,&#xD;
      Switzerland; Genentech, South San Francisco, Chicago, USA), and bevacizumab (Avastin;&#xD;
      Genentech). Generally speaking, the binding affinity of VEGF is stronger in aflibercept than&#xD;
      in ranibizumab and bevacizumab. Previous studies have shown that aflibercept may be effective&#xD;
      in eyes resistant to ranibizumab or bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though the studies of the 2 years results of anti-VEGF agents showed great efficacy in&#xD;
      improving vision in nAMD, the visual outcome of the long term treatment were&#xD;
      inconsistent.Besides, studies about the long-term efficacy in Asians were limited.In this&#xD;
      retrospective study, we aim to investigate the 4 year result of nAMD treated with anti-VEGF&#xD;
      agents in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHOD A retrospective, interventional case series analysis o of patients with&#xD;
      nAMD treated at the Ophthalmology department at Changhua Christian Hospital for at least 4&#xD;
      years was conducted. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Changhua&#xD;
      Christian Hospital and was adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Only&#xD;
      patients who were both treatment naive upon the initial visit and fulfilled the reimbursement&#xD;
      criteria set by Taiwan NHIB for subsidized ranibizumab were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ranibizumab has been reimbursed for the treatment of nAMD by the Taiwan National Health&#xD;
      Insurance Bureau (NHIB) since 2012, with a total reimbursement of 3 or 7 injections for each&#xD;
      eye depending on the clinical response of the patient in his or her lifetime, after which,&#xD;
      the treatment is paid by the patients themselves. In order to be reimbursed by the NHIB,&#xD;
      patients must be at least 50 years old at the time of diagnosis, and had nAMD confirmed by&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography, with subretinal fluid or macular edema demonstrated by optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT). In addition, there should be no macular scars on the fovea, and&#xD;
      the best correct decimal visual acuity (BCVA) should be ranging between 0.05 to 0.5. The&#xD;
      waiting period for the permission of reimbursement of ranibizumab was around 4 weeks, thus&#xD;
      some patients would have a self-paid bevacizumab injection during the waiting period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eyes included in this study received an initial loading dose of 3 monthly intravitreal&#xD;
      injections of either ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab. Afterwards, the treatment was made on a&#xD;
      loose treat and extend protocol based on funduscopic examination, OCT findings and BCVA. The&#xD;
      loose treat and extend protocol is as follows: if under examination there is stabilization of&#xD;
      macular edema and resolution of subretinal fluid by OCT, plus no retinal hemorrhage by&#xD;
      biomicroscopy with 90D lens and a stabilized BCVA for 2 successive visits, the next treatment&#xD;
      and follow up were extended by 1 month. If the examination showed any signs of recurrence and&#xD;
      the deterioration of VA equal or more than 1 line, the treatment injection interval was then&#xD;
      shortened by 1 month. Most, but not all, of our patients followed the above loose treat and&#xD;
      extend strategy since some patients would insist on following up and treatment with less&#xD;
      frequency in spite of disease activity. Generally speaking, the patients' follow up interval&#xD;
      and dosing schedule are made to be equal to or less frequent than a bi-monthly basis after 1&#xD;
      year, even though there are signs of neovascular activity; either because of the economic&#xD;
      burden, or the fear of the surgical procedures of intravitreal injection by the patients.&#xD;
      Aflibercept was considered when the patient developed persistent subretinal fluid, or needed&#xD;
      more frequent injections than a bi-monthly dosing. Patients had BCVA measured, along with&#xD;
      funduscopic examination with 90 D lens and OCT imaging with Spectralis-OCT (Heidelberg&#xD;
      Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether aflibercept was later used as a rescue&#xD;
      therapy. Group 1 received bevacizumab and ranibizumab only. Group 2 received bevacizumab,&#xD;
      ranibizumab, and later aflibercept rescue therapy. Outcome measures include BCVA at 1 year, 2&#xD;
      years, 3 years and 4 years of follow up, and the average number of injections per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The BCVA obtained during each visit was converted from decimal to&#xD;
      logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMar) for calculation. Chi-square test were&#xD;
      used to Compare the baseline data including age, sex, eye. Mann-Whitney-U test was used to&#xD;
      compare the difference of age, and average number of injections per year between the 2&#xD;
      groups. Mann-Whitney-U test, Wilcoxon test and independent t-test were used for the&#xD;
      comparison of BCVA at different time points in each group. Patients were also divided&#xD;
      according to their initial BCVA (&gt;1.0 or &lt;=1.0 in logMar), or age (&gt;70 or &lt;=70 years of age)&#xD;
      to see whether initial BCVA or age play a role in the visual changes. A p-value of less than&#xD;
      0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. All the analyses were performed using SPSS&#xD;
      software package (ver. 23.9; SPSS Inc., Chicago, illinois, USA).&#xD;
