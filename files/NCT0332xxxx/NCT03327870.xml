      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A person s dental health depends on many factors. Some are social, economic, or behavioral.&#xD;
      Some are environmental. People with Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s Syndrome have a change in the&#xD;
      amount and quality of saliva. This may affect dental health. Researchers want to study the&#xD;
      dental health needs of people with this and other salivary gland problems. They will compare&#xD;
      these findings with healthy volunteers. This will help them improve health care for these&#xD;
      groups of people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study dental health needs of people with salivary gland problems and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      To study the disparities in dental health between these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older who were in a Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s Syndrome study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers the same age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take an online survey. It should take less than 30 minutes. They can skip&#xD;
      any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be asked about dental health, general health, and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information in the survey will be kept secure.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determinants of health, particularly oral health, have not been evaluated in the context of&#xD;
      Sjogren s Syndrome (SS) and other salivary gland dysfunctions. It is known that the&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative changes in salivary flow that occur in SS place those with this&#xD;
      complex autoimmune disorder at increased risk of dental caries, oral infections, mucosal&#xD;
      ulceration, salivary gland enlargement and functional impairment. There is conflicting&#xD;
      evidence on the risk of periodontal disease in this population. Furthermore, it has been&#xD;
      reported that this population experiences a greater number of dental visits, decayed teeth,&#xD;
      and dental restorations in the preceding year, and have a 2-3 fold increased annual out-of&#xD;
      pocket dental care expenditure compared to those without SS. Moreover, the oral and dental&#xD;
      needs of those with SS have not been quantified in the context of oral health disparities,&#xD;
      i.e., by strata of vulnerable groups. Those with other salivary gland dysfunction such as&#xD;
      Sicca and those who have signs and symptoms of salivary gland dysfunction that only partially&#xD;
      fulfill the classification criteria for SS, also known as incomplete SS (ISS), have neither&#xD;
      been assessed for oral health needs nor have oral health disparities been ascertained in this&#xD;
      high-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll adults classified as SS, Sicca, ISS, as well healthy volunteers as well as&#xD;
      those excluded by the 2016 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for SS. Therefore, the aims of&#xD;
      this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ascertain the oral health needs of those with SS, Sicca, and ISS in comparison with&#xD;
           healthy volunteers (HV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify oral health disparities in this high-risk population (SS, Sicca, ISS) in&#xD;
           comparison with HV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an observational study with a cross-sectional survey administered to the study&#xD;
      population at enrollment, to ascertain their oral health needs and oral health disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants have been evaluated and classified into SS, Sicca, ISS, and HV cohorts as&#xD;
      part of the SS clinical protocols: 84-D-0056, 99-D-0018, 11-D-0172, 15-D-0051 and 94-D-0018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Health Outcomes will be captured using the protocols described in the NHANES Oral Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire, with the inclusion of additional dental/oral health questions. All oral health&#xD;
      outcomes will be ascertained once at the time of study enrollment. Self-reported oral health&#xD;
      needs and self-reported importance of key oral health needs will be ascertained as part of&#xD;
      the double-scaled oral health study instrument. This will enable discrepancy scoring of key&#xD;
      oral health outcomes and calculation of a numeric needs index. These instruments have been&#xD;
      pilot tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Exposures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Health Disparities will be based on indicators for the following and will be ascertained&#xD;
      at enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Race&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SES levels (Educational attainment, employment status, home ownership, food security)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Geographic location (Six-level urban-rural classification scheme for U.S. counties and&#xD;
           county-equivalent entities developed by NCHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sexual orientation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marital status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disabilities (physical disability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental health&#xD;
