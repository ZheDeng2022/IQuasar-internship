  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, adaptive, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Sham-controlled&#xD;
      pilot study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Vibrant Capsule in relieving&#xD;
      constipation in subjects with functional constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three arms will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vibrant Capsule with vibrating mode 1 administered 5 times per week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vibrant Capsule with vibrating mode 2 administered 5 times per week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sham Capsule administered 5 times per week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed continuously for at least a 2 weeks run-in period and then be&#xD;
      randomized to either Vibrant or Sham capsules for a treatment period of 8 weeks. The first 2&#xD;
      weeks of treatment will be considered as a subjects' training period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data reporting will be done on an electronic Case Report Form and an eDiary. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to refrain from taking any medication or supplement to relieve their constipation,&#xD;
      during the entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the run-in period, the subjects will return and eligibility will be re-assessed.&#xD;
      Subjects will be trained on how to use the base unit and will swallow the first capsule on&#xD;
      site the day of baseline visit. They will activate and ingest the rest of the capsules at&#xD;
      home by themselves, using the base unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to complete a simple subject eDiary each day throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the study. A final visit will take place at the end of the 8 week treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive phone calls at least once a week and subject compliance will be&#xD;
      monitored during the 8 weeks of the study.&#xD;
