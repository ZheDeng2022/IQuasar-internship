  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenomyosis affects approximately 21% of symptomatic women who present to gynecology clinics.&#xD;
      The disease is characterized by heavy bleeding and pain during periods. Limited treatment&#xD;
      options exist for the treatment of adenomyosis for women who desire future child-bearing or&#xD;
      prefer to avoid surgery. Recently, ulipristal acetate has been studied as a treatment option&#xD;
      for women who have fibroids and heavy bleeding. The majority of women treated with ulipristal&#xD;
      stopped having periods altogether. Our study aims to determine whether ulipristal is an&#xD;
      adequate treatment for women with adenomyosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenomyosis affects an estimated 20.9% of symptomatic women who present to gynecology&#xD;
      clinics, with peak prevalence of 32% in 40-49 years old. Prior histologic studies in women&#xD;
      undergoing hysterectomy show prevalence of with some variation due to differing histologic&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria 10-37.1%. Heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea are commonly&#xD;
      manifested in women with adenomyosis. However, data on treatment of adenomyosis remains&#xD;
      scarce. For women desiring definitive options, hysterectomy remains the treatment of choice.&#xD;
      However, for women who desire future fertility, the currently accepted first-line therapy is&#xD;
      progestogen therapy, particularly the levonorgestrel-IUD. Other limited studies have used&#xD;
      danazol and GnRH agonists, but its use is limited by significant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM) have emerged as successful&#xD;
      medical treatment options for leiomyoma. The SPRM ulipristal acetate has been studied&#xD;
      extensively in the treatment of leiomyoma and more recently endometriosis. Ulipristal acetate&#xD;
      exerts both antagonist and agonist properties. Amenorrhea was achieved in 80% of women taking&#xD;
      5mg of ulipristal daily by treatment month 2 and up to 90% of women taking 10mg daily.&#xD;
      Anovulation was achieved in 80% of women taking 5mg and 10mg dosing. Ulipristal acetate has&#xD;
      not been studied as a treatment option for women with adenomyosis. We aim to study the effect&#xD;
      of daily ulipristal on heavy menstrual bleeding in women with adenomyosis.&#xD;
