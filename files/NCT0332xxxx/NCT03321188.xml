      This study will evaluate the use of Heated Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) for primary&#xD;
      treatment of ovarian cancer at the time of surgical debulking, to assess if intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      chemotherapy can be started within 42 days of HIPEC and cytoreduction. All patients will&#xD;
      receive cytoreductive surgery followed by a one-time closed HIPEC with cisplatin at 41-43&#xD;
      degrees Celsius for 90 minutes in the operating room. This is followed by 6 cycles of&#xD;
      intravenous carboplatin and paclitaxel on an outpatient basis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heated Intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has several potential benefits. High-dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy can be used due to the plasma-peritoneal barrier resulting in little absorption&#xD;
      into the blood stream. Additionally, there is higher peritoneal penetration in comparison to&#xD;
      IV regimen, and does not have the limitation of traditional IP regimen of post-operative&#xD;
      adhesions. Hyperthermia itself has cytotoxic effects and can increase the depth of tumor&#xD;
      penetration by the chemotherapeutic agent up to 3 millimeters; moreover, hyperthermia can&#xD;
      potentiate its antineoplastic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent times, morbidity and mortality associated with HIPEC has drastically improved. One&#xD;
      large retrospective review of 694 patients, treated between 2005 and 2011, utilizing the&#xD;
      American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQUIP)&#xD;
      database, demonstrated a complication rate of 33% and 30-day mortality of 2.3%, both rates&#xD;
      consistent with outcomes for other major complex abdominal operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a Phase I dose escalation study to evaluate maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HIPEC&#xD;
      administration of cisplatin in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients was&#xD;
      published. The MTD of cisplatin was 100 milligrams per meter squared (mg/m2) with no&#xD;
      mortality or safety concerns. While the trial had only 12 patients, all were able to receive&#xD;
      post-operative IV chemotherapy, with all patients completing at least five cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In protocol Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-0172, intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel,&#xD;
      plus intravenous paclitaxel, demonstrated the longest median survival reported in optimally&#xD;
      debulked stage III ovarian cancer. Currently, the GOG is studying variations of the&#xD;
      intraperitoneal (IP) regimen to preserve the survival advantage, but make it tolerable for&#xD;
      patients to receive 6 cycles without discontinuing therapy due to distress and toxicity. The&#xD;
      importance of developing an acceptable GOG-0172 alternative is emphasized by the recent&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) Clinical Announcement recognizing the superiority of&#xD;
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy in the optimal disease setting.&#xD;
