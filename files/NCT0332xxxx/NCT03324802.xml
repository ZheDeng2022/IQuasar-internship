  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well hypofractionated radiation therapy works in&#xD;
      preventing the return of tumor cells in breast cancer patients following surgery.&#xD;
      Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter&#xD;
      period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the 24-month complication rate of 5 fraction whole radiotherapy +/-&#xD;
      concurrent boost as compared to 15 fraction radiotherapy +/- sequential boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate acute and late toxicity. II. To estimate the 5-year locoregional control,&#xD;
      invasive disease-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate fatigue, and other patient-reported outcomes. II. To evaluate clinical&#xD;
      features, treatment technique, dose-volume parameters, histologic and genetic variants&#xD;
      associated with fair and poor cosmetic outcomes or unplanned surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the costs and comparative effectiveness of treatment. IV. Compare the use of&#xD;
      photon therapy with spot scanning proton therapy in two different hypo-fractionated whole&#xD;
      breast schemas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Within 12 weeks of breast cancer surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo&#xD;
      radiation therapy in 15 daily fractions for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Within 12 weeks of breast cancer surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiation therapy in 5 daily fractions for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 5 years.&#xD;
