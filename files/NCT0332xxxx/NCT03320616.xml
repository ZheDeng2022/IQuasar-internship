  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates hepatitis B virus replication through the bile acids&#xD;
      pathway. EYP001a is a selective, synthetic FXR agonist under development for the treatment of&#xD;
      hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1 study is designed primarily to assess Pharmacokinetics (PK) under fed and fasted&#xD;
      conditions, and to assess the safety, tolerability and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of single oral&#xD;
      doses of EYP001a in subjects with chronic HBV infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, 4-way crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 14 chronic HBV subjects will participate. Subjects will receive 4 single dose&#xD;
      administrations of EYP001a during the study. There will be 2 separate dosing periods: 1&#xD;
      period with 2 single administrations of EYP001a in the morning, once under fasted conditions&#xD;
      and once under fed condition (separated by 48.5 hours), and 1 period with 2 single&#xD;
      administrations of EYP001a in the evening, once under fasted conditions and once under fed&#xD;
      condition (separated by 48.5 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequence 1: Period 1 first dose morning fasted, second dose morning fed; Period 2 first&#xD;
           dose evening fasted, second dose evening fed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequence 2: Period 1 first dose evening fasted, second dose evening fed; Period 2 first&#xD;
           dose morning fasted, second dose morning fed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequence 3: Period 1 first dose morning fed, second dose morning fasted; Period 2 first&#xD;
           dose evening fed, second dose evening fasted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequence 4: Period 1 first dose evening fed, second dose evening fasted; Period 2 first&#xD;
           dose morning fed, second dose morning fasted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will include an eligibility screening period of maximally 40 days, clinic stay&#xD;
      during the treatment periods, and a followup visit 4 to 6 days after the last study drug&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of EYP001a will be assessed by evaluating vital signs, ECGs,&#xD;
      liver ultrasound, clinical laboratory and adverse events.&#xD;

             be willing to use adequate contraception from screening until 90 days after the&#xD;
             followup visit. Adequate contraception is defined as using hormonal contraceptives or&#xD;
             an intrauterine device combined with at least 1 of the following forms of&#xD;
             contraception: a diaphragm or cervical cap, or a condom. Also, total abstinence, in&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Male subjects, if not surgically sterilized, should be willing to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception and not donate sperm from (first) admission to the clinical research&#xD;
             center until 90 days after the follow-up visit. Adequate contraception for the male&#xD;
             subject (and his female partner) is defined as using hormonal contraceptives or an&#xD;
             intrauterine device combined with at least 1 of the following forms of contraception:&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. At screening, has no recent (&lt;3 months) history of any clinically significant&#xD;
             conditions, which, in the opinion of the PI, would jeopardize the safety of the&#xD;
             subject or impact the validity of the study results&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Willingness to abstain from alcohol and methylxanthine-containing beverages or food&#xD;
             (coffee, tea, cola, chocolate, energy drinks) from 48 hours prior to (each) admission&#xD;
             to the clinical research center&#xD;
