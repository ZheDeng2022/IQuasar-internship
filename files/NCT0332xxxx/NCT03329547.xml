  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cefixime is an orally active third generation cephalosporin indicated for the treatment of&#xD;
      acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute otitis media, uncomplicated acute cystitis&#xD;
      and uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Cefixime acts by inhibiting the action of proteins involved&#xD;
      in the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, which leads to bacterial cell lysis and cell death.&#xD;
      Due to lack of bioequivalence between tablet/capsule and suspension formulation of cefixime,&#xD;
      consideration needs to be given if the oral suspension is to be substituted for the&#xD;
      tablet/capsule. This study is designed to assess whether test SKF101804 cefixime 400&#xD;
      milligrams (mg) capsule is bioequivalent to reference cefixime 400 mg capsule under fasting&#xD;
      conditions in healthy adults. Subjects will be randomized in crossover manner to receive&#xD;
      single oral doses of treatment A (SKF101804 cefixime test capsules) and treatment B&#xD;
      (reference cefixime capsules), followed by a washout period of 7-14 days. Approximately 26&#xD;
      subjects will be included in the study and total duration in the study for each subject will&#xD;
      be approximately 5 to 7 weeks.&#xD;
