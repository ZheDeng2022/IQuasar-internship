    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay for the&#xD;
      improvement of near vision in presbyopes implanted in corneal pockets with a delayed or a&#xD;
      non-delayed approach.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must be presbyopic with a reading add from +1.5 to +2.5 D, and both emmetropes (MRSE&#xD;
      from -0.5 to +0.5 D) as well as ametropes (requiring concurrent LASIK) are included in the&#xD;
      investigation. In the non-delayed approach, the corneal pocket is created and inlay implanted&#xD;
      on the same surgical day. In the delayed approach, the corneal pocket is created and&#xD;
      dissected but the corneal inlay is not implanted. After one to three months, the corneal&#xD;
      inlay is implanted on a second surgical day.&#xD;

            <description>Intervention: Raindrop Near Vision Inlay&#xD;
In the delayed approach, the corneal pocket is created and dissected but the corneal inlay is not implanted. After one to three months, the corneal inlay is implanted on a second surgical day.&#xD;
Raindrop Near Vision Inlay: The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay was approved by the US FDA in June of 2016 for the improvement of near vision in presbyopic emmetropes. Raindrop is a clear device made of a hydrogel material and resembles a microscopic contact lens; it is the first implantable device that changes the shape of the cornea to correct the refractive errors that cause near vision problems.</description>
