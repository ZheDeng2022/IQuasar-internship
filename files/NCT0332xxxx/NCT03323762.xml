      The aim of this pilot cohort study is to investigate whether treatment with remote ischemic&#xD;
      conditioning (RIC) has a beneficial effect on blood pressure as well as the immune system in&#xD;
      pregnant women with newly diagnosed hypertension (&gt; 140/58 mm Hg) or pre-eclampsia before&#xD;
      gestational week 37+3.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia, which affects about 2 to 7% of pregnancies, is a major cause of maternal and&#xD;
      perinatal morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of clinical symptoms (hypertension, proteinuria or end- organ dysfunction), are&#xD;
      often seen in the last trimester of a pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease can have major consequences for both the child and the mother. Yet there are only&#xD;
      very limited treatment options, where induced labour is the only healing treatment. Today,&#xD;
      the treatment consists in limiting blood pressure increase with medical treatment, whereby&#xD;
      the pregnancy most often can result in term delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote Ischaemic Conditioning (RIC) achieved by an automatic inflation of a blood pressure&#xD;
      cuff to induce four 5-minute cycles of limb ischaemia and reperfusion, is a treatment that&#xD;
      has been found to decrease the inflammatory response and lower blood pressure in states of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is virtually a cost-free non-pharmacological and non-invasive therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy performed by the patient herself in her home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, whether RIC actually can improve clinical outcomes in relation to lowering blood&#xD;
      pressure and the inflammatory response in pregnant women with newly diagnosed hypertension is&#xD;
      yet to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot cohort study is to investigate whether treatment with remote ischemic&#xD;
      conditioning (RIC) has a beneficial effect on blood pressure as well as the immune system in&#xD;
      pregnant women with newly diagnosed hypertension (&gt; 140/58mm Hg) or pre-eclampsia before&#xD;
      gestational week 37+3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point • Median arterial blood pressure after 6 days of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-point&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Changes in the inflammatory response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot cohort study at Aarhus University Hospital, Regional Hospital Randers and Region&#xD;
      Hospital Herning 20 pregnant women with signs of gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia&#xD;
      (systolic blood pressure above 140 and / or diastolic blood pressure over 85; +/-&#xD;
      proteinuria, +/- clinical signs or subjective symptoms and signs) are to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study flowchart:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly hospital referred women with signs of gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia will be&#xD;
      asked to participate. Informed consent will be obtained and blood pressure, blood samples,&#xD;
      and weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: resting day at home - blood pressure measuring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 2-7: Morning: Blood pressure measuring and RIC treatment. Evening: blood pressure&#xD;
           measuring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 7: In hospital: Blood samples and weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pros and cons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to the inflation of the blood pressure cuff temporary moderate pains in the&#xD;
      treated arm might occur. Otherwise, the RIC is without side effects. Two extra blood samples&#xD;
      of app. 50 ml each will be drawn, with a small risk of local infection exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usefulness of the study The study is designed as a small pilot study. In which the set up&#xD;
      will be tested and the effects on blood pressure and the inflammatory response in a relative&#xD;
      small size will be explored. A larger randomised study will follow if the results show a&#xD;
      positive trend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive as well as negative and inconclusive results will be widely disseminated through&#xD;
      national and international scientific journals and conferences.&#xD;
