    <textblock>
      The molecular nature of insulin resistance in human muscle is still incompletely defined. Our&#xD;
      data indicate that acetylation of mitochondrial proteins in humans is regulated by muscle&#xD;
      contraction and is dysregulated in insulin resistance. Poor function of mitochondria in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle is a hallmark of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. We propose to use a&#xD;
      combination of clinical research and mass spectrometry techniques to determine how the&#xD;
      cytosolic and mitochondrial protein acetylation is regulated by muscle contraction in insulin&#xD;
      sensitive and resistant human volunteers. We will test the hypothesis that mitochondrial&#xD;
      protein acetylation is decreased to a greater degree following a bout of exercise in insulin&#xD;
      sensitive than in insulin resistant human muscle. Using these techniques we also propose to&#xD;
      determine how acetylation of mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT1) at lysines&#xD;
      10, 23, and 92 regulates ANT1 structure and function. Finally, we propose 4) to use a&#xD;
      combination of molecular modeling and in vitro assays together with the approach developed in&#xD;
      Aim 3 to characterize the role of acetylation in other mitochondrial proteins. Protein&#xD;
      targets for this aim will be prioritized based on the potential role of the protein in&#xD;
      insulin resistance or mitochondrial function as well as dysregulation of its acetylation&#xD;
      state in insulin resistant muscle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project has been to define the molecular basis for insulin resistance in&#xD;
      human muscle. The preceding two cycles of this project were devoted to using proteomics&#xD;
      approaches to map and quantify serine/threonine (S/T) phosphorylation sites on insulin&#xD;
      receptor substrate (IRS)-1 in skeletal muscle from healthy and insulin resistant humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent proteomics experiments reveal that another protein modification, lysine acetylation,&#xD;
      is more common in non-histone proteins than has been recognized. There are no data, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, regarding a relationship between insulin resistance in vivo in human muscle and&#xD;
      protein acetylation. We have used proteomics techniques to discover a number of lysine&#xD;
      acetylation sites in skeletal muscle proteins in vivo in humans, and this is prominent in&#xD;
      mitochondrial proteins. Preliminary data show that mitochondrial protein acetylation is&#xD;
      regulated by muscle contraction, and that this response is reduced in insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Finally, the mitochondrial inner membrane protein adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT)1 was&#xD;
      abundantly acetylated under resting conditions, and its deacetylation in response to&#xD;
      contraction was reduced in insulin resistance. Because ANT1 exerts significant physiological&#xD;
      control strength for ADP/ATP exchange, and because mitochondrial function is altered in&#xD;
      insulin resistance, it is important to characterize this abnormality. Therefore, in order to&#xD;
      determine how abnormalities in regulation of lysine acetylation characterize insulin&#xD;
      resistant muscle, we propose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To determine how the cytosolic and mitochondrial protein acetylomes are regulated by&#xD;
      muscle contraction in insulin sensitive and resistant human volunteers. We will test the&#xD;
      hypotheses that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. There is differential acetylation of cytosolic or mitochondrial proteins in insulin&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Mitochondrial protein acetylation is decreased to a greater degree following a bout of&#xD;
      exercise in insulin sensitive than in insulin resistant human muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. To determine how acetylation of the mitochondrial inner membrane adenine nucleotide&#xD;
      translocase ANT1 regulates protein structure and function. We will use mitochondria isolated&#xD;
      from human muscle biopsies and molecular dynamics and elastic network modeling to test the&#xD;
      hypotheses that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Deacetylation of lysines 10, 23, and 92 increases ANT1 activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oxidation of the mitochondrial matrix (increasing the NAD/NADH ratio) raises&#xD;
           deacetylation activity and decreases acetylation of ANT1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ANT1 molecular dynamics are altered by acetylation of lysines 10, 23, and 92.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aims that involve clinical research will be complemented by two aims (Aims 1 and 4)&#xD;
      performed entirely in vitro, not using human specimens or data. For context, these aims are&#xD;
      listed on page 1 of the accompanying Research Proposal. We have retained the numbering scheme&#xD;
      from the original proposal to avoid confusion. Please note that only Aims 2 and 3 involve&#xD;
      clinical research.&#xD;
