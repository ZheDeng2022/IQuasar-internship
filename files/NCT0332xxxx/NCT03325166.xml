      This pilot phase II trial study evaluates the usefulness of the ferumoxytol steady state&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for response assessment after pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      radiation therapy in non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to the brain (brain&#xD;
      metastases). The interactions of monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab, and the body's&#xD;
      immune system may result in an anti-tumor effect. However, it may also increase inflammation&#xD;
      around the tumor which cannot be differentiated from true tumor growth on standard MRI. This&#xD;
      study evaluates ferumoxytol as an MRI contrast agent to differentiate this treatment related&#xD;
      inflammation from true tumor growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV)&#xD;
      measured by steady state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ferumoxytol in predicting true&#xD;
      versus (vs) pseudoprogression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in subjects with brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab when given with SRS in subjects with&#xD;
      brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate progression free survival, overall survival, best response in brain disease,&#xD;
      best response in systemic disease, and duration of best responses of brain and systematic&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the immune response as determined by the volume, pattern and intensity of delayed&#xD;
      (24 hour [hr]) ferumoxytol uptake between subjects who develop true vs pseudoprogression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Investigate the serum immunological parameters and correlate clinical as well as&#xD;
      radiological response with systemic immune response to pembrolizumab as measured by&#xD;
      immunological panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare the changes percentage expression in PDL-1 in the biopsy tissue before and after&#xD;
      therapy at the time of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. In subjects with measurable systemic lesions, investigate the feasibility of measuring&#xD;
      vascular volume fraction (VVF), vessel size index (VSI) and vessel density index (VDI) as&#xD;
      surrogate for response (true vs. pseudoprogression, as measured with Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for up to 2 years (or up to 32 cycles) in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive ferumoxytol IV and undergo MRI at baseline, 12&#xD;
      weeks after radiation, at suspected radiographic progression, and 6 weeks after suspected&#xD;
      radiographic progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks for&#xD;
      up to 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
