  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common syndrome in patients with severe dementia is agitated behavior, which is&#xD;
      often characterized by a combination of violent behavior (physical or verbal), restlessness,&#xD;
      and inappropriate loudness. The treatment options for this syndrome are limited and lead to&#xD;
      severe side effects. In vivo experiments on animals and clinical studies on adults show that&#xD;
      cannabinoids could have a beneficial effect on behavioral disorders in general, and in&#xD;
      dementia-related disorders in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, medical cannabis patients have reported that cannabis aids in pain relief,&#xD;
      increased appetite, and a sense of calm and peace of mind. Elderly patients suffering from&#xD;
      dementia that experience this syndrome could also benefit from other quality of life aspects&#xD;
      of the cannabis treatment such as reduction in medication consumption, weight gain and&#xD;
      improvement of sleep.&#xD;

      In this randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 60 patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either CBD-A (30:1) cannabis rich low THC oil (30% CBD and 1% THC) or a&#xD;
      placebo oil. The primary efficacy endpoint was a decrease of four or more points on the&#xD;
      Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) score by week 16, as compared to baseline.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints included improvement of other neurobehavioral symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questionnaires will be administered by trained staff at every visit: The CMAI,&#xD;
      a to measure the types and frequencies of agitated behaviors, and the Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Inventory-Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH) to measure behavioral disturbances.&#xD;
