    <textblock>
      Background: Different methods for lumbar pedicular screw insertion have been advocated,&#xD;
      however each technique has its cons and pros. Due to limited resources for O-Arm and&#xD;
      navigation in our locality, the investigator was enforced to use the surgical skills to&#xD;
      minimize the need for such advanced modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: Is to clarify the benefits of the use of free hand technique using direct&#xD;
      visualization of the pedicles and disc space as the only guide for pedicular screw insertion&#xD;
      using postoperative CT for evaluation of the accuracy of pedicle screw insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: One hundred and forty four screws were inserted in 32 patients using&#xD;
      direct pedicle visualization and disc space orientation as a single intraoperative reference&#xD;
      guide. The study was conducted in Zagazig University Hospitals from May, 2014 to June, 2015.&#xD;
      CT was done for all patients as a direct postoperative evaluation tool.&#xD;

      Patients and methods: This study was conducted in Zagazig University Hospitals in the period&#xD;
      from May 2014 to June 2015 after approval from the Zagazig University Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board (Zu-IRB). All patients were subjected to complete history talking, clinical evaluation&#xD;
      and adequate radiological and laboratory investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiological studies included plain X-Ray lumbosacral spine, anteroposterior, lateral&#xD;
      neutral, and lateral dynamic views (lateral with flexion and lateral with extension), MRI&#xD;
      lumbosacral spine sagittal and axial views, and in some cases CT lumbosacral spine with&#xD;
      sagittal reconstruction. All these modalities give us a good idea about both soft tissue and&#xD;
      bony pathology in the area of interest. Selection of the patients for surgery was based on&#xD;
      clinicoradiologic items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the cases of pedicular screw insertion were preceded by full laminectomy with discectomy&#xD;
      for interbody fusion. In all cases the medial and inferior aspects of the pedicle are clearly&#xD;
      visualized, so selection of the entry point and direct observation of medial and inferior&#xD;
      pedicle violation are two main advantages of this technique. On the other hand after&#xD;
      discectomy the disc space with the two parallel endplates are available for use as a guide&#xD;
      for screw craniocaudal angulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the removal of the whole lamina with its inferior articular processes and removal of&#xD;
      fibrocartilagenous tissues overlying the exiting roots and removal of the intervertebral&#xD;
      disc, the anatomy of the pedicle and its relation to the exiting roots is clearly evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting pedicular screw insertion, part of the cortical bone at the inferolateral edge of&#xD;
      the superior facet is removed. This entry point lies exactly along the transverse plane&#xD;
      passing through the middle of the corresponding transverse process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time the inferior and medial surfaces of the pedicle along with the exiting nerve&#xD;
      root are clearly visualized, so all factors needed for correct pedicle screw insertion are&#xD;
      available including the correct entry point, the mediolateral and craniocaudal orientation in&#xD;
      addition to the visual protection provided from inside the canal to observe any medial or&#xD;
      inferior pedicle violation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator used to insert a dissector inside the disc space as an additional guide to&#xD;
      craniocaudal orientation of the screw which should be parallel to the disc space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of pedicular screw insertion is completed as usual and the disc space is properly&#xD;
      curetted using the suitable shavers then the prepared autologous bone graft is impacted in&#xD;
      the disc space. The remaining screws are inserted and the rods are installed and secured as&#xD;
      usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time needed for each screw insertion was calculated. During the previous steps neither&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guidance nor neuronavigation were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the previous steps, a single lateral and anteroposterior film was used to&#xD;
      confirm the correct screw position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery is completed as usual and the patient is discharged for follow up after two&#xD;
      weeks, during which a complementary CT scan lumbar spine is routinely performed and analyzed&#xD;
      for the accuracy of the screw position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pedicle violation was assessed whether medial, inferior, lateral or superior.&#xD;
