  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of atezolizumab, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin,&#xD;
      and rituximab and to see how well they work in treating patients with transformed diffuse&#xD;
      large B-cell lymphoma that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability&#xD;
      of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving atezolizumab, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and&#xD;
      rituximab may work better in treating patients with transformed diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety and toxicity of atezolizumab in combination with immunogenic&#xD;
      chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin) with rituximab (R-GEMOX-ATEZO) in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory (rel/ref) transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including&#xD;
      determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      R-GEMOX-ATEZO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate on-treatment changes in density of and proximity between immune cell subsets in&#xD;
      the tumor microenvironment after immunogenic chemotherapy alone and R-GEMOX-ATEZO by&#xD;
      multispectral immunofluorescence, including density of CD8+ cells and cytotoxic lymphocyte&#xD;
      (CTL):regulatory T cell (Treg) ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Evaluate genomic (e.g. gene expression&#xD;
      profiles, whole exome sequencing) characteristics of patients with rel/ref transformed DLBCL&#xD;
      treated with R-GEMOX-ATEZO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV), gemcitabine IV, and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin IV every 2 weeks. Starting cycle 2, patients also receive atezolizumab IV over&#xD;
      30-60 minutes every 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 14 days of cycle 1 and every 28 days for&#xD;
      up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive rituximab IV and atezolizumab over 30-60 minutes IV on&#xD;
      day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months for up to 1 year.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus of vitiligo with&#xD;
                  dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis would&#xD;
                  be excluded) are permitted provided that they meet the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients with psoriasis must have a baseline ophthalmologic exam to rule out&#xD;
                       ocular manifestations&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Rash must cover less than 10% of body surface area (BSA)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requiring low potency&#xD;
                       topical steroids (e.g., hydrocortisone 2.5%, hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%,&#xD;
                       fluocinolone 0.01%, desonide 0.05%, alclometasone dipropionate 0.05%)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  No acute exacerbations of underlying condition within the last 12 months&#xD;
                       (not requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation [PUVA], methotrexate,&#xD;
                       retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors; high potency or&#xD;
                       oral steroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced),&#xD;
             organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing&#xD;
             pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) scan; history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field&#xD;
             (fibrosis) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1, including, but not limited&#xD;
             to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signs or symptoms of infection within 2 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1;&#xD;
             patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., for prevention of a urinary tract&#xD;
             infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to cycle 1, day 1 or anticipation of&#xD;
             need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before cycle 1, day 1 or&#xD;
             anticipation that such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required during the study&#xD;
             and up to 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (approximately&#xD;
                  October to March); patients must not receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine&#xD;
                  within 4 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1 or at any time during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because atezolizumab, gemcitabine, and&#xD;
             oxaliplatin are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects;&#xD;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with atezolizumab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with atezolizumab,&#xD;
             gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin; these potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study&#xD;
