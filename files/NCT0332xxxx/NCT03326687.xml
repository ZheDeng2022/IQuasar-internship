  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals have difficulty with word retrieval, also called anomia, following&#xD;
      cerebrovascular accident (CVA). These difficulties impede effective communication in everyday&#xD;
      conversations and can negatively impact the resumption of pre-injury activities. Even after&#xD;
      rehabilitation specifically targeting these areas, many individuals report persistent&#xD;
      difficulties with anomia. Additionally, most individuals report that these difficulties&#xD;
      worsen when distracted, fatigued, or when attempting to divide attention between tasks. Given&#xD;
      that everyday activities frequently require efficient communication when attention is divided&#xD;
      (e.g., walking and talking), it is important to investigate viable interventions to improve&#xD;
      these skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery from CVA and resumption of pre-injury activities is best supported by rehabilitation&#xD;
      interventions that are functional and directly related to the tasks individuals aim to&#xD;
      resume. For example, a therapy task requiring an individual to generate a grocery list and&#xD;
      then go to a grocery store to acquire the items on the list has a greater impact on recovery&#xD;
      for the underlying language and cognitive skills than a series of generic language and&#xD;
      cognition tasks completed in a therapy room. In addition to this, interventions that&#xD;
      incorporate dual-task practices tend to have better outcomes than more traditional&#xD;
      single-task practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of pairing word retrieval tasks with&#xD;
      physical endurance tasks versus presenting them in isolation. Additionally, this study will&#xD;
      investigate whether improvements in word retrieval and physical endurance generalize to the&#xD;
      functional, everyday task of holding a conversation while walking. The researchers&#xD;
      hypothesize that participants will perform better on word retrieval tasks after participating&#xD;
      in dual language and physical tasks than after participating in language tasks presented in&#xD;
      isolation.&#xD;

      All data collection will occur at Quality Living (QLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will administer a set of standardized assessments prior to initiating the&#xD;
      intervention program to determine eligibility for study participation as well as to gather&#xD;
      descriptive information about the language abilities of participants. Assessments will&#xD;
      include the Western Aphasia Battery - Revised and the Boston Naming Test. In addition to&#xD;
      performing language assessments, participants will respond to demographic and injury-related&#xD;
      questions and will identify preferred topics of conversation. The researchers will obtain&#xD;
      information about each participant's physical status by referring to the physical therapy&#xD;
      assessments and associated documentation completed by a QLI physical therapist shortly after&#xD;
      the individual's arrival at QLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention will occur five days per week and will take place during participants' regularly&#xD;
      scheduled speech therapy sessions. Two intervention sessions will occur daily, one held in&#xD;
      the morning and the second held in the afternoon. Depending on the activities performed on a&#xD;
      given day, the total time devoted to intervention sessions will be 10 to 30 minutes (i.e., 5&#xD;
      to 15 minutes per session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each intervention session, the researchers will measure performance on one or more of&#xD;
      the following tasks: (a) five trials of generative naming given a unique category and&#xD;
      one-minute response period per trial, (b) distance traveled using an exercise machine for&#xD;
      five minutes, (c) generative naming given unique categories and one-minute response periods&#xD;
      and distance traveled using an exercise machine when performing both tasks simultaneously for&#xD;
      five minutes, (d) number of words generated in five minutes in response to conversational&#xD;
      topic prompts, (e) distance traveled when walking for five minutes, and (f) number of words&#xD;
      generated in response to conversational topic prompts and distance traveled when walking when&#xD;
      performing both tasks simultaneously for five minutes. The first three measures comprise&#xD;
      intervention tasks, and the remaining three are generalization measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and generalization sessions will follow an overlapping ABAB or BABA format, with&#xD;
      the first day of each phase being an overlap day. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      begin the intervention either with an A or B phase. On overlap days, the researchers will&#xD;
      collect measures on all six intervention and generalization activities, with three being&#xD;
      performed during a fifteen-minute morning session and three being performed during a&#xD;
      fifteen-minute afternoon session. For participants in the A phase, the researchers will&#xD;
      collect measures two times daily for each of the subsequent four days on the generative&#xD;
      naming and exercise machine activities performed as independent tasks; for participants in&#xD;
      the B phase, the researchers will collect measures two times daily for each of the subsequent&#xD;
      four days on the generative naming and exercise machine activities performed as simultaneous&#xD;
      tasks. A phase sessions will last ten minutes each, and B phase sessions will last five&#xD;
      minutes each. The cycle of A and B phases will repeat throughout a participants inpatient&#xD;
      stay at QLI. A QLI physical therapist will be present to monitor safety during performance of&#xD;
      physical activities. The researchers will audio record all generative naming and&#xD;
      conversational discourse activities for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will only perform naming, discourse, and physical endurance tasks that are&#xD;
      included as part of their routine speech-language therapy and physical therapy sessions.&#xD;
      However, completion of the physical endurance tasks will not occur during the participants'&#xD;
      physical therapy sessions; instead, they will occur during speech-language therapy sessions.&#xD;
      The naming and discourse tasks will also occur during the participants' speech-language&#xD;
      therapy sessions.&#xD;
