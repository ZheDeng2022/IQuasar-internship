      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 T cell&#xD;
      receptor (TCR) (HA-1 T TCR) T cells in treating patients with acute leukemia that persists,&#xD;
      has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) following donor stem&#xD;
      cell transplant. T cell receptor is a special protein on T cells that helps them recognize&#xD;
      proteins on other cells including leukemia. HA-1 is a protein that is present on the surface&#xD;
      of some peoples' blood cells, including leukemia. HA-1 T cell immunotherapy enables genes to&#xD;
      be added to the donor cells to make them recognize HA-1 markers on leukemia cells.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose-escalation study of CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 TCR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive fludarabine for 1-3 doses 3-14 days prior to HA-1 TCR T cell administration.&#xD;
      Patients then receive CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 TCR T cells intravenously (IV) over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up closely for 12 weeks and then&#xD;
      every 6 months for years 1-5, and every year for years 6-15.&#xD;
