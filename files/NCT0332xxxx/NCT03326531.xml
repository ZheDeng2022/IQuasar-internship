      Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) treated with one screw in situ fixation results in&#xD;
      an altered gait. It is thought that the protraction of the pelvis at the affected side, seen&#xD;
      in patients with unilateral stable SCFE, is a compensatory mechanism to reduce out-toeing and&#xD;
      thereby improve foot positioning during gait. This study will evaluate this hypothesis since&#xD;
      only a few studies are conducted evaluating gait in treated SCFE. It is also thought that&#xD;
      this pathology results in an impaired balance. Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment&#xD;
      (CAREN) will be used to investigate these two questions.&#xD;

      Rationale: Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) treated with one screw in situ fixation&#xD;
      results in an altered gait. It is thought that the protraction of the pelvis at the affected&#xD;
      side, seen in patients with unilateral stable SCFE, is a compensatory mechanism to reduce&#xD;
      out-toeing and thereby improve foot positioning to restores the gait patterns towards a&#xD;
      'normal gait pattern. The goal of this study is to investigate this hypothesis since only a&#xD;
      few studies are conducted evaluating gait in treated SCFE. It is also thought that this&#xD;
      pathology results in an impaired balance. Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment&#xD;
      (CAREN) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether protraction of the&#xD;
      pelvis at the affected side is a compensatory mechanism to reduce out-toeing and thereby&#xD;
      improve foot positioning and restores the gait pattern towards a 'normal' gait pattern in&#xD;
      patients with unilateral stable SCFE, treated with single screw in situ fixation. Dynamic&#xD;
      postural balance will be analysed as well since an altered, waddling gait, is observed in&#xD;
      patients with treated SCFE. In addition, activity patterns of lower limb muscles will also be&#xD;
      evaluated using surface electromyography. Kinematic and EMG data of patients will be compared&#xD;
      with data of healthy controls with no gait pathology in order to investigate these&#xD;
      objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the evaluation of clinical outcomes and spatiotemporal parameters in&#xD;
      these patients compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: a comparative cross-sectional case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Children and adolescents with stable SCFE managed with single screw in situ&#xD;
      fixation and an age, gender and BMI matched healthy controls without gait pathology. Patients&#xD;
      were excluded if major complications occurred due to in situ fixation, if they had revision&#xD;
      surgery or had additional pathology leading to gait alterations. In addition, patients are&#xD;
      required to walk without walking aid for at least 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Kinematic data will be studied at pelvis, hip, knee and&#xD;
      ankle level. Margins of stability will be calculated to analyse dynamic postural balance. In&#xD;
      addition, lower extremity muscle activation patterns of SCFE patients will be recorded to&#xD;
      assess muscle activation pattern during gait. Correlations between the severity of initial&#xD;
      slip and the clinical outcome after treatment will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The risk of CAREN based gait analysis is negligible. A safety harness provides&#xD;
      protection against falling. It will avoid subject falling on or off the treadmill while&#xD;
      performing training. The safety harness is secured with a life line to the ceiling. The&#xD;
      burden of the children or adolescents is minimal. Participants will visit the MUMC+ once,&#xD;
      where questionnaires (Hip Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, SF-36 questionnaires, Borg&#xD;
      CR10 Score and NRS score) physical examination and gait analysis will be performed. The whole&#xD;
      session will take 2 hours. Due to the nature of the study, this study can only be done using&#xD;
      this specific patient group.&#xD;

        We expect that no major deviations in gait pattern occur later than 6 months after the&#xD;
        intervention and therefore, a stable gait pattern is presented 6 months postoperatively.&#xD;
        This expectation is made based on clinical experience, in which gait is often affected&#xD;
        during these first 6 months after the intervention due to pain, a long non-weightbearing&#xD;
        period of the leg in the postoperative phase and rehabilitation. After these six months no&#xD;
        further deviations in gait pattern were expected and a stable, compensating gait pattern is&#xD;
        observed and patients will be analysed between 6 months till 10 years postoperatively.&#xD;
