  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a frequent disease and a serious public health problem, of which suicide is the&#xD;
      most severe complication. Its treatment is based on the introduction of antidepressant which&#xD;
      not only proposes a significant delay in the relief of symptoms but also by the phenomenon of&#xD;
      lifting of inhibition can increase the suicidal risk during the initiation phase. Therefore&#xD;
      there is a major interest in proposing a monitoring of these dark and suicidal ideas,&#xD;
      immediately after the implementation of such treatment as well as other symptoms of&#xD;
      depression. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the mechanisms underlying this&#xD;
      increase in dark and suicidal ideas in this context.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study propose to assess, with an ecological momentary assessment method, the evolution of&#xD;
      black ideas over 30 days following the introduction or switch of an oral antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      103 patients will be recruited suffering from a current major depressive disorder in the&#xD;
      Montpellier University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will attend a total of 3 scheduled visits, which will be completed over a period&#xD;
      of 1 month (inclusion, between 10-15 days, 1 month. During this month, the patient will have&#xD;
      to complete daily assesments throught a smartphone application &quot;Depasse&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Servier application allows the daily monitoring of symptoms allowing a regular&#xD;
      evaluation, in the form of smileys simulating a Likert type scale evaluation of 1 to 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 parameters are evaluated: moral, black thoughts, sleep, stress, concentration, social&#xD;
      activities, energy, pleasure, motivation and libido. Note that when the patient expresses&#xD;
      dark thoughts, he is then asked if he wants to hurt himself. If he answers yes, he is then&#xD;
      asked to contact an emergency service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of its originalities is the addition of positive psychology approaches with a positive&#xD;
      reinforcement of this evaluation through reward by a smiley in a smiley box and obtaining a&#xD;
      &quot;pleasant&quot; image for motivation and incentive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is the possibility to have the graphical follow-up of the various parameters and to&#xD;
      send them by mail to his treating psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advice adapted to the mood of the day is provided taking into account the &quot;dysfunctional&quot;&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, the emergency buoy tool provides access to emergency numbers and directs the&#xD;
      patient to seek care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intelligence of the weight and the treatments established. The app also has a notification&#xD;
      setting to remind the patient to evaluate themselves daily.&#xD;

    <description>Application DEPASSE in depressed patients. This application was developed by the laboratory SERVIER, by a scientific committee of psychologists and psychiatrists: Pr. Courtet, Dr Rimlinger and Pr. Swendsen.&#xD;
Depasse is available for all on the App store and on Googleplay.&#xD;
This application has several interests:&#xD;
- The first is the daily monitoring of the symptoms allowing a regular evaluation throught smileys simulating a scale from 1 to 5. The 10 parameters evaluated are: mood, dark ideas, sleep, stress, concentration, social activities, energy, pleasure, motivation and libido.&#xD;
There is the possibility to generate a graph representing the evolution of these parameters.&#xD;
Tips adapted to the actual mood are provided related to the &quot;dysfunctional&quot; parameters.</description>
