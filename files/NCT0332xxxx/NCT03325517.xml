    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 243 amino acid E1A encoded by the left end of the human adenovirus (Ad) type 2 or 5&#xD;
      genome has been studied in various contexts including as a model cooperating oncoprotein , an&#xD;
      apoptosis inducing protein, and as a therapeutic oncolytic protein. All of these properties&#xD;
      are associated with its capacity to rapidly induce S phase in a variety of cells. E1A&#xD;
      orchestrates most of these effects by interacting with an array of chromatin remodeling&#xD;
      complexes, including the Rb family proteins, and the HAT proteins p300 and CBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Myst family protein HBO1 (Myst2, KAT7) is a histone acetyl transferase that plays a major&#xD;
      role in replication initiation and also contributes to DNA re-replication. HBO1 directly&#xD;
      interacts with Cdt1 and functions as a coactivator of Cdt1 in replication initiation. It also&#xD;
      associates with replication origin and stimulates origin activation by acetylating H4 K5, K8,&#xD;
      and K12. Overexpression of HBO1 induces DNA re-replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM OF THE STUDY: The Specific Aim of this study is to determine whether or not the&#xD;
      stimulation of HBO1 activity by E1A plays a role in deregulated DNA replication, and if it&#xD;
      does, to determine the mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Using standard assays the investigators will determine whether E1A binds to HBO1 to&#xD;
           induce its HAT activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will determine whether E1A stimulation of HAT activity of HBO1&#xD;
           contributes to DNA re-replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the investigators will determine whether E1A associates with replication origins and&#xD;
      whether this association requires HBO1. The investigators will use the MCM4 origin which maps&#xD;
      in the intergenic region between PRKDC and (Protein Kinase, DNA-Activated, Catalytic&#xD;
      Polypeptide) and MCM4 genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will transfect U2OS cells with plasmids expressing relevant proteins then&#xD;
      determine their occupancy in origin sequences using ChIP assays. Plasmids expressing epitope&#xD;
      tagged WT HBO1 or mutant derivatives along with plasmids expressing WT or mutant E1A proteins&#xD;
      will be expressed in U2OS cells, then occupancy of these proteins on origin regions will be&#xD;
      quantified using antibodies as appropriate. Typically in these experiments, using relevant&#xD;
      antibodies, ChIP assays are performed with primer pairs encompassing origin regions and also&#xD;
      regions that are far from origin. Occupancy of initiation factors are increased several fold&#xD;
      in the origin region as compared to that of 2KB upstream or downstream regions. Loading of&#xD;
      MCM complex along with Cdt1 onto the origins is an indication that initiation of replication&#xD;
      occurs in that origin and usually assayed in ChIP-re-ChIP assays as follows: First, loading&#xD;
      of HBO1 to the origins will be confirmed using epitope specific antibodies in the first ChIP.&#xD;
      The anti-HBO1 precipitates will be re-ChIPed with anti-MCM3 antibodies. Loading of MCM3&#xD;
      helicase to origins occurs after Cdt1 binding and depends on HBO1 HAT activity. Normal&#xD;
      amounts of MCM3 will be detected after re-ChIP-ing in E1A+ control samples. If reduced amount&#xD;
      of MCM3 is recovered in reChIP assays when mutant E1A or HBO1 mutant (e.g. HBO1 G435A) is&#xD;
      used, it would indicate that stimulation of HAT activity by E1A is critical for maximal&#xD;
      origin activity in E1A+ cells. This type of assay has considerable flexibility in that mutant&#xD;
      proteins can be rapidly assayed. This ChIP-reChiP assays will repeated in different&#xD;
      combinations to determine the E1A loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results will be extended to virus infection assays. G1 specific cells isolated by drug&#xD;
      treatment will be infected with Ad vectors expressing epitope tagged proteins as appropriate.&#xD;
      Association of E1A and HBO1 and their mutant derivatives will be determined. This assay will&#xD;
      allow us to confirm the effect of E1A stimulated HAT activity in origin firing and study the&#xD;
      effects of E1A on origin firing, if any, other than increasing the HAT activity of HBO1.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TThe 243 amino acid E1A protein (also known as small E1A protein, transforming E1A protein)&#xD;
      encoded by the left end of the human adenovirus (Ad) type 2 or 5 genome has been studied in&#xD;
      various contexts including as a model cooperating oncoprotein, an apoptosis inducing protein,&#xD;
      and as a therapeutic oncolytic protein. All of these properties are associated with its&#xD;
      capacity to rapidly induce S phase in a variety of cells. E1A orchestrates most of these&#xD;
      effects by interacting with an array of chromatin remodeling complexes, including the Rb&#xD;
      family proteins, and the HAT proteins p300 and CBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The induction of E2F by E1A-Rb-HDAC interactions is well documented whereas the consequences&#xD;
      of E1A-p300/CBP interactions in cell cycle progression are not clear. Previous studies&#xD;
      demonstrated that p300/CBP prevents premature entry of quiescent cells into S phase by&#xD;
      repressing c-Myc transcription through a tripartite repressor complex consisting of p300,&#xD;
      YY1, HDAC3. E1A binds to p300 and dissociates the repressor complex to induce S phase.&#xD;
      Induction of c-Myc by this mechanism contributes to the induction of DNA damage response and&#xD;
      aberrant cellular DNA replication which leads to genomic instability. In a recently published&#xD;
      study, it was shown that E1A induces the pivotal DNA replication initiation factor Cdt1 to&#xD;
      high levels resulting in increased replication origin activity and in late S phase, induction&#xD;
      of DNA damage response and cellular DNA re-replication. Using the single molecule DNA fiber&#xD;
      assay, it was discovered that E1A induces significant changes in the dynamics of DNA&#xD;
      replication and appears to induce global changes in origin activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cdt1 is a pivotal DNA replication initiation factor whose levels oscillate during cell cycle&#xD;
      progression. In late G1, its levels rise to initiate DNA replication. At the beginning of S&#xD;
      phase it is promptly degraded by the E3 ligase so that origins that are already fired once do&#xD;
      not fire again in S phase and re-replication within a single cell cycle does not occur.&#xD;
      Impaired degradation of Cdt1 in S phase by the E3 ligase is the major mechanism by which the&#xD;
      cellular DNA undergoes re-replication. It was discovered that in E1A expressing cells Cdt1&#xD;
      levels remain high in S phase suggesting an inefficient degradation of Cdt1 which may&#xD;
      contribute to extensive re-replication of cellular DNA that the investigators observed in&#xD;
      late S phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Myst family protein HBO1 (Myst2, KAT7) is a histone acetyl transferase that plays a major&#xD;
      role in replication initiation and also contributes to DNA re-replication. HBO1 directly&#xD;
      interacts with Cdt1 and functions as a coactivator of Cdt1 in replication initiation. It also&#xD;
      associates with replication origin and stimulates origin activation by acetylating H4 K5, K8,&#xD;
      and K12. Overexpression of HBO1 induces DNA re-replication. The enrichment of chromatin&#xD;
      modifications including acetylation of H4 histones at the origins strongly influences origin&#xD;
      activation. Thus, E1A in the absence of a multitude of serum stimulated proliferation&#xD;
      signals, forces cells to enter S phase using several compensatory mechanisms. Uncontrolled&#xD;
      cellular DNA replication program causes polyploidy that is the hallmark of cancer. It is&#xD;
      exciting that a viral oncogene such as E1A alters the cellular DNA replication program. This&#xD;
      raises a number of important questions related to the mechanism of replication stress induced&#xD;
      by a viral oncogene. For example, how does E1A induce DNA re-replication? Does E1A&#xD;
      stimulation of HBO1 alter initiation mechanism and whether HBO1 mediated chromatin&#xD;
      modifications at the origins promote re-replication?&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Specific Aim is to determine whether or not the stimulation of HBO1 activity by E1A plays&#xD;
      a role in deregulated DNA replication, and if it does, to determine the mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Using standard assays the investigators will determine whether E1A binds to HBO1 to&#xD;
           induce its HAT activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using transient and virus infection assays, the investigators will determine whether&#xD;
           stimulation of HBO1 HAT activity by E1A enhances the pre-replicative complex (Pre-RC)&#xD;
           formation and whether E1A induced HAT activity qualitatively and quantitatively changes&#xD;
           the H4 acetylation at the origin regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the investigators will determine whether E1A stimulation of HAT activity of HBO1&#xD;
           contributes to DNA re-replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine whether stimulation of HBO1 HAT activity by E1A (i)&#xD;
      enhances initiation (ii) induces qualitative and quantitative changes in acetylation of H4&#xD;
      K5, K8 and K12 at the origin region, and (iii) enhances re-replication that occurs in E1A+&#xD;
      cells. If increased HAT activity can stimulate one or more of these functions, it could&#xD;
      explain how this property of E1A would contribute to the induction of aberrant DNA&#xD;
      replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. E1A binding to WT and HAT deficient HBO1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           the investigators will first determine whether E1A directly binds to HBO1 by performing&#xD;
           the GST binding and in vivo co-IP experiments. If binding is confirmed, the&#xD;
           investigators will map the binding sites on both proteins. the investigators will then&#xD;
           isolate mutants of both proteins that abolish the interactions. All E1A mutants will be&#xD;
           evaluated for their interactions with Rb and p300 and only mutants that retain their&#xD;
           capacity to bind to these proteins will be used. It will be necessary to isolate an HBO1&#xD;
           mutant that retains E1A binding capacity but lacks the HAT activity. A widely used HAT&#xD;
           deficient mutant G435A will be used in these studies. If E1A binds to this mutant, it&#xD;
           will be a valuable mutant to confirm that E1A induced HAT activity is critical for&#xD;
           stimulation of replication initiation. If this HBO1 mutant does not bind to E1A, it will&#xD;
           be important to isolate new HBO1 mutants which retain E1A binding capacity but lack HAT&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Role of E1A induced HBO1 HAT activity in origin activation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           First, the investigators will determine whether E1A associates with replication origins&#xD;
           and whether this association requires HBO1. the investigators will use the MCM4 origin&#xD;
           which maps in the intergenic region between PRKDC and (Protein Kinase, DNA-Activated,&#xD;
           Catalytic Polypeptide) and MCM4 genes. First, the investigators will transfect U2OS&#xD;
           cells with plasmids expressing relevant proteins then determine their occupancy in&#xD;
           origin sequences using ChIP assays. Plasmids expressing epitope tagged WT HBO1 or mutant&#xD;
           derivatives along with plasmids expressing WT or mutant E1A proteins will be expressed&#xD;
           in U2OS cells, then occupancy of these proteins on origin regions will be quantified&#xD;
           using antibodies as appropriate. Typically in these experiments, using relevant&#xD;
           antibodies, ChIP assays are performed with primer pairs encompassing origin regions and&#xD;
           also regions that are far from origin. Occupancy of initiation factors are increased&#xD;
           several fold in the origin region as compared to that of 2KB upstream or downstream&#xD;
           regions. Loading of MCM complex along with Cdt1 onto the origins is an indication that&#xD;
           initiation of replication occurs in that origin and usually assayed in ChIP-re-ChIP&#xD;
           assays as follows: First, loading of HBO1 to the origins will be confirmed using epitope&#xD;
           specific antibodies in the first ChIP. The anti-HBO1 precipitates will be re-ChIPed with&#xD;
           anti-MCM3 antibodies. Loading of MCM3 helicase to origins occurs after Cdt1 binding and&#xD;
           depends on HBO1 HAT activity. Normal amounts of MCM3 will be detected after re-ChIP-ing&#xD;
           in E1A+ control samples. If reduced amount of MCM3 is recovered in reChIP assays when&#xD;
           mutant E1A or HBO1 mutant (e.g. HBO1 G435A) is used, it would indicate that stimulation&#xD;
           of HAT activity by E1A is critical for maximal origin activity in E1A+ cells. This type&#xD;
           of assay which has been successfully used by others has considerable flexibility in that&#xD;
           mutant proteins can be rapidly assayed. This ChIP-reChiP assays will repeated in&#xD;
           different combinations to determine the E1A loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These results will be extended to virus infection assays. G1 specific cells isolated by&#xD;
           drug treatment will be infected with Ad vectors expressing epitope tagged proteins as&#xD;
           appropriate. Association of E1A and HBO1 and their mutant derivatives will be&#xD;
           determined. This assay will allow us to confirm the effect of E1A stimulated HAT&#xD;
           activity in origin firing and study the effects of E1A on origin firing, if any, other&#xD;
           than increasing the HAT activity of HBO1. For example, c-Myc induction by E1A does not&#xD;
           involve HAT activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Effects of E1A induced HBO1 HAT activity in the acetylation of H4, K5, K8 and K12.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess this, the investigators will ChIP the chromatin prepared from virus infected&#xD;
           cells with the origin specific primers and epitope specific antibodies as appropriate to&#xD;
           detect origin loading of HBO1. the investigators will then re-Chip the ChIP precipitates&#xD;
           using anti-H4 tetra-Ac antibodies to detect K5, K8, and K12 acetylation. In cells&#xD;
           expressing E1A and HBO1, H4 acetylation will be increased considerably as compared to&#xD;
           cells infected with HBO1 virus alone. H4 acetylation may be affected depending on the&#xD;
           mutants used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. E1A stimulated HBO1 HAT activity in re-replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Overexpression of HBO1 has been shown to induce DNA-replication. To determine whether&#xD;
           E1A uses HBO1 in inducing re-replication by stimulating the HBO1 HAT activity, the&#xD;
           investigators will infect S phase enriched cells (isolated by double thymidine block)&#xD;
           with Ad viruses expressing the WT or mutant E1A proteins along with Ad vectors&#xD;
           expressing HBO1 variants (e.g. HAT inactive), allow the infection to proceed as needed&#xD;
           then quantify the population of cells containing &gt;4N DNA content using flow cytometer.&#xD;
           If E1A simulated HBO1 HAT activity is important for re-replication HAT defective HBO1&#xD;
           mutants will not induce re-replication even in the presence of E1A. E1A mutants that&#xD;
           cannot bind to HBO1 will also show a similar phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. E1A effects on H4 acetylations in re-replicating origins:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to study the H4 acetylations in re-replicating origins, the investigators need&#xD;
           to know which of cellular origins undergo re-replication in E1A+ cells in late S phase.&#xD;
           the investigators are planning to identify the origins activated in E1A+ cells including&#xD;
           those that re-replicate. Once the investigators identify one or two re-replicating&#xD;
           origins, the investigators will quantify the acetylations using these origins in cells&#xD;
           expressing epitope tagged WT and mutant HBO1 alleles and E1A. the investigators&#xD;
           anticipate qualitative or quantitative (or both) in H4 acetylations due to E1A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Expected results and pitfalls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of all the proposed experiments, the investigators expect to determine whether&#xD;
      stimulation of HBO1 HAT activity by E1A is critical for origin activation in E1A+ cells and&#xD;
      if E1A induced HAT activity has a role in re-replication. The investigators do not anticipate&#xD;
      any technical or other problems including obtaining relevant reagents.&#xD;
