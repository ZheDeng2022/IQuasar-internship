      In this study, participants with histologically diagnosed locally advanced esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma who have received preoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      followed by surgery harbouring high risk of tumor recurrence will receive adjuvant&#xD;
      cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy followed by pembrolizumab. The primary study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that adjuvant pembrolizumab will improve the 1-year recurrence-free survival rate compared to&#xD;
      historical control.&#xD;

      It is a single-arm phase II trial. The target population is patients with histologically&#xD;
      diagnosed locally advanced ESCC patients (clinically staged at least T3 and/or any N and M0&#xD;
      by endoscopic ultrasonography [EUS] and fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography&#xD;
      [FDG-PET]) who have received preoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by&#xD;
      surgery, and exhibit high risk (closed or involved resection margin or extranodal invasion of&#xD;
      involved lymph nodes or ypN2-3) of tumor recurrence. Eligible patients will receive adjuvant&#xD;
      cisplatin-based CRT followed by pembrolizumab for 18 cycles.The study will enroll 46 patients&#xD;
      in Taiwan. The estimated enrollment period is 2 years.&#xD;
