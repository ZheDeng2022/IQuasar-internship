  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm pilot study evaluating the antitumor activity and safety of&#xD;
      niraparib as neoadjuvant therapy in participants with Human epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      2 (HER2)-negative and breast cancer susceptibility gene mutant (BRCAmut) localized breast&#xD;
      cancer (primary tumor &gt;=1 centimeters [cm]). Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), breast&#xD;
      ultrasound, and tumor core biopsy will be performed at the screening (Days -28 to -1).&#xD;
      Participants will receive niraparib (200 milligrams [mg] orally [PO]) treatment daily for 28&#xD;
      days (Cycle 1) and then will undergo breast ultrasound at the end of Cycle 1 on Day 28. Based&#xD;
      on breast ultrasound reports, the participants will either discontinue the study (disease&#xD;
      progression) or will continue niraparib treatment (complete response [CR], partial response&#xD;
      [PR] or stable disease [SD]) for an additional cycle (Cycle 2). A breast MRI and breast&#xD;
      ultrasound will be performed at the end of Cycle 2. Approximately 21 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study and the study duration will be approximately 2 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Tumor Response Measured by Breast MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response measured by breast MRI is defined as &gt;=30 percent (%) reduction of tumor volume from Baseline based on primary lesion after niraparib treatment without any new lesion development. Tumor volume was calculated as (length × width × height × pi [π])/6. Responses were assessed as Clinical complete response (CR): A complete disappearance of all tumor signs in the breast as assessed by imaging test. Clinical partial response (PR): A reduction in the tumor volume of the primary tumor size by &gt;=30% assessed by palpation or imaging test. Clinical stable disease (SD): No significant change in tumor volume during treatment. Clinical progressive disease (cPD): The development of new, previously undetected lesions, or an estimated increase in the size of the primary lesion by greater than 20%. Percentage of participants with tumor response and its 95 percent confidence interval (CI) has been presented. The 95% CI was the binomial exact CI based on Clopper-Pearson method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Response (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>pCR is defined as ypT0/Tis ypN0 by receipt of pre-operative chemotherapy (Yes versus No). Following neoadjuvant therapy, pathological staging is recorded using the 'yp' designation. ypT0/Tis ypN0 is the absence of invasive cancer in the breast and axillary nodes. pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (i.e., ypT0/Tis ypN0 in the current American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging system). Percentage of participants with pCR rate its 95 percent CI has been presented. CI was based on binomial exact CI.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Tumor Response as Measured by Breast Ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response rate was based on the change in tumor volume as measured by breast ultrasound; a response was considered &gt;=30 percent reduction of tumor volume from Baseline without any new lesion development. Tumor volume was calculated as (length × width × height × π)/6. Percentage of participants with tumor response and its 95 percent CI has been presented. CI was based on binomial exact CI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Tumor Volume Measured by Ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage change in tumor volume from Baseline was measured using ultrasound. Baseline was defined as the most recent measurement prior to the first administration of niraparib. Tumor volume was calculated as (length × width × height × π)/6. The percentage reduction in tumor volume was set as 99% if the tumor becomes too small to measure at the post-baseline visit. Percent change from Baseline was defined as greatest change in volume, derived from all available cycles of niraparib (range from cycle 2 to 6) and multiplied by 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Tumor Volume Measured by MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage change in tumor volume from Baseline after 2 months of niraparib treatment was measured using MRI. Baseline was defined as the most recent measurement prior to the first administration of niraparib. Tumor volume was calculated as (length × width × height × π)/6. The percentage reduction in tumor volume was set as 99% if the tumor becomes too small to measure at the post-baseline visit. Percent change from Baseline was defined as value of post Baseline minus Baseline value and multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Treatment Discontinuations and Dose Reductions Due to Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event. A TEAE is any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment.</description>

        <description>Tumor response measured by breast MRI is defined as &gt;=30 percent (%) reduction of tumor volume from Baseline based on primary lesion after niraparib treatment without any new lesion development. Tumor volume was calculated as (length × width × height × pi [π])/6. Responses were assessed as Clinical complete response (CR): A complete disappearance of all tumor signs in the breast as assessed by imaging test. Clinical partial response (PR): A reduction in the tumor volume of the primary tumor size by &gt;=30% assessed by palpation or imaging test. Clinical stable disease (SD): No significant change in tumor volume during treatment. Clinical progressive disease (cPD): The development of new, previously undetected lesions, or an estimated increase in the size of the primary lesion by greater than 20%. Percentage of participants with tumor response and its 95 percent confidence interval (CI) has been presented. The 95% CI was the binomial exact CI based on Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event. A TEAE is any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants received niraparib 200 milligrams (mg) orally once daily in 28-day treatment cycles. After 2 cycles, participants either underwent surgery, received additional cycles of niraparib (maximum of 6 cycles total), or received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, at physician's discretion. A breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at the end of cycle 2 and breast ultrasounds were performed at the end of each cycle, including any additional cycles beyond cycle 2. After completion of all neoadjuvant therapy participants proceeded to surgery, at which time pathological complete response (pCR) was assessed.</description>
