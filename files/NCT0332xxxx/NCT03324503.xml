  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, unblinded/open-label study of the effect size of HRCT&#xD;
      endpoints in response to glucocorticoid induction therapy in subjects with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      pulmonary sarcoidosis who have not received glucocorticoid as initial sarcoidosis therapy (≥&#xD;
      20 mg/day prednisone or prednisolone) or other sarcoidosis therapy for at least 3 months&#xD;
      prior to enrollment. This study will enroll a total of approximately 24 subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimal development of novel treatments for sarcoidosis requires clinical study endpoints&#xD;
      that efficiently reflect changes in disease activity over short treatment durations. Such&#xD;
      endpoints enable preliminary assessment of candidate drug efficacy in small studies - prior&#xD;
      to exposing large cohorts to experimental compounds in pursuit of registrational data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will accordingly investigate the ways that certain HRCT-based functional&#xD;
      respiratory imaging (FRI) measures can serve as more quantitative and sensitive endpoints&#xD;
      compared to pulmonary function tests to measure drug effect in a short duration small sample&#xD;
      size study in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The study is designed to minimize impact&#xD;
      on sarcoid care that the patient would have otherwise received. Glucocorticoid (≥ 30 mg/day&#xD;
      prednisone or prednisolone) as per local clinical practice of sarcoidosis initial induction&#xD;
      therapy will be taken orally in this study. The glucocorticoid dose may be modified depending&#xD;
      on ongoing assessment as a part of standard local clinical practice.&#xD;
