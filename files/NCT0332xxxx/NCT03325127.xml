  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no real-world data that describes how Radium-223 (Ra-223) is being used in&#xD;
      combination with abiraterone/enzalutamide (abi/enza) or evidence describing outcomes of this&#xD;
      combination usage for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (mCRPC). To address these data gaps a cohort of mCRPC patients will be chosen who received&#xD;
      Ra-223 concomitant with abi/enza in first line therapy to assess the treatment patterns&#xD;
      following first line and clinical outcomes from initiation of first line treatment. For the&#xD;
      purpose of this study concomitant use will be defined as Ra-223 initiated after at least 6&#xD;
      months from the start of first line abi/enza. The specific objectives of the study are to&#xD;
      describe the outcomes, treatment patterns, patient and provider characteristics of mCRPC&#xD;
      patients treated with Ra-223 concomittantly with abi/enza in first line treatment.&#xD;
