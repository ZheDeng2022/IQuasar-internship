    <textblock>
      Single arm, first-in human feasibility study using the Symphony - MRI guided focused&#xD;
      ultrasound system for the treatment of leiomyomas. The study is expected to accrue over 12&#xD;
      months. This study will help determine the feasibility to ablate leiomyomas, as measured by&#xD;
      MR thermometry and contrast enhanced imaging. In addition, the study will look at the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the treatment, as measured by the reduction in fibroid size and&#xD;
      reduction in symptom severity score and adverse events. This study will help develop future&#xD;
      pivotal trials using the same device.&#xD;
