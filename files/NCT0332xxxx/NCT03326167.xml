  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of its availability, non-invasiveness, and high diagnostic performance, myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion tomoscintigraphy has become a standard tool for the detection, characterization and&#xD;
      monitoring of coronary artery disease. Standard analysis, based on the reversibility of&#xD;
      regional myocardial hypoperfusion between stress (physiological or pharmacological) and rest,&#xD;
      has good sensitivity and negative predictive value in the search for myocardial ischemia.&#xD;
      However, two major obstacles persist. First, because of the relative nature of the&#xD;
      normalization of cardiac activity, this approach may underestimate the extent of the damage,&#xD;
      especially when the territory with the most activity is itself pathological. Thus myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion scintigraphy can only detect 40 to 50% of tri-truncal patients. To overcome these&#xD;
      disadvantages, several indexes have been proposed to improve the diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      perfusion scintigraphy in multi-truncal patients based in particular on kinetic analysis.&#xD;
      Secondly, the review does not provide any guarantee as to the quality and reproducibility of&#xD;
      use of the coronal reserve during stress, in particular during submaximal stress tests and&#xD;
      pharmacological stress, the latter being easily antagonized by xanthine derivatives contained&#xD;
      in tea and coffee in particular (abstinence of at least 12 to 24 hours being recommended). In&#xD;
      recent years and thanks to the advent of CZT semiconductor cameras dedicated to cardiology -&#xD;
      to perform a dynamic tomographic acquisition - a study of the coronal reserve is feasible by&#xD;
      perfusion tomoscintigraphy in current practice. This study of the coronary reserve mainly&#xD;
      consists of a computer post-processing of the myocardial perfusion scintigraphy data and does&#xD;
      not therefore require any additional irradiation (the only difference with respect to the old&#xD;
      protocols is the start of the images at the time of publication. injection of the&#xD;
      radiotracer). However, the diagnostic benefit gained from the coronary reserve study compared&#xD;
      to conventional stress / rest perfusion scintigraphy has not been clearly studied,&#xD;
      particularly in the multi-truncal patients.&#xD;
