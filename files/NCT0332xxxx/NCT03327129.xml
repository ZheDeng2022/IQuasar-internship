  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since capability for suicide involves overriding potential pain, and the opioid system plays&#xD;
      a strong role in controlling pain perception, it follows that capability for suicide may be&#xD;
      impacted by the opioid system. The goal of the proposed research is to identify the neural&#xD;
      network underlying capability for suicide in order to determine if it can be a target for&#xD;
      identifying high-risk individuals and for intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little evidence exists distinguishing individuals with suicidal ideation (SI) from those at&#xD;
      risk for suicidal behaviour, illustrating the need for more comprehensive biomarkers for&#xD;
      clinicians to guide their treatment approach and for new treatment avenues. Current theories&#xD;
      of suicide have suggested the importance of an individual's capability for suicide in&#xD;
      predicting suicide attempt or death. Building on this, Yovell and colleagues (2016) provided&#xD;
      important preliminary data that the opioid system affects suicide risk, but the neural&#xD;
      mechanisms and their relationship to capability for suicide are unclear. The goal of the&#xD;
      proposed research is to identify the neural network underlying capability for suicide using&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to determine if it can be a target for&#xD;
      identifying high-risk individuals and for intervention.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria for patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 18-55&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capability of giving informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not currently pregnant or lactating (due to potential confounding of brain activity as&#xD;
             a result of differing hormone levels)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lifetime history of any substance abuse, psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of any opioid acting drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of any prescription pain medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of over the counter pain medications within 15 hours of brain scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For daily users of a benzodiazepine, stimulant or atypical antipsychotic, dose within&#xD;
             12 hours of brain scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For as needed users of a benzodiazepine, stimulant or atypical antipsychotic, dose&#xD;
             within 2 weeks of brain scan. This is because non-daily use will have more&#xD;
             unpredictable effects on brain imaging results than those who are using these&#xD;
             medications on a regular basis. The 2 weeks will ensure the drug is not in the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical condition requiring immediate investigation or treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in experimental treatment trials for the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy control inclusion criteria: Ages between 18 and 55 years, capable of giving&#xD;
        informed consent, not pregnant or lactating, no lifetime history of Axis I/II disorders, no&#xD;
        history of antidepressant or mood stabilizer use, no treatment for acute or ongoing medical&#xD;
        condition, no use of any over the counter pain medication for at least 15 hours prior to&#xD;
        the brain scan.&#xD;
