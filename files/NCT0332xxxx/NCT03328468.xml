  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the breathing intervention, participants completed two experimental sessions at least two&#xD;
      weeks apart. The experimental sessions were randomized between the slow-breathing condition&#xD;
      (6 breaths/min) or the control breathing condition (12 breaths/min). Breathing interventions&#xD;
      were 15 minutes in length and completed with the assistance of the breathing app, Breathe&#xD;
      Deep (Mineev, Bizi Apps LLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breathing intervention is currently completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reliability and validity study of AFAS is ongoing. This is a one-time visit for&#xD;
      participants in which participants will undergo screening of sensation and movement as well&#xD;
      as fill in some questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants had two visits for the breathing exercise. The only planned intervention was&#xD;
      the breathing exercise, which is now concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for the breathing intervention was as follows: The breathing protocol lasted 15&#xD;
      minutes. It was a guided breathing awareness session with a registered nurse (PhD student)&#xD;
      who is also trained in integrative therapies and yoga instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, during one of the visits the reliability and validity of a new scale for stroke&#xD;
      to measure quality of movement and body awareness is tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part is still ongoing and thus this becomes a one-time visit.&#xD;
