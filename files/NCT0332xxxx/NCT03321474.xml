  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient with discolored anterior teeth and need conservative restoration treated with all&#xD;
      ceramic esthetic laminate veneers. The Patient will be satisfied with restoration mimic the&#xD;
      surrounding natural teeth, but conventional preparation shows approximately 60% of veneer&#xD;
      failure in form of color change and nearly 67% Fractures of laminate veneers so the modified&#xD;
      gull wing preparation is a significant factor affecting the final esthetic especially in&#xD;
      discolored teeth and improve fracture resistance of the restoration.&#xD;

      This trial will be conducted on patient from the outpatient clinic in the fixed&#xD;
      prosthodontics clinic, faculty of oral and dental medicine, Cairo University Adherence&#xD;
      session will take place in the presence of the patients in the initial visit. This include&#xD;
      that patient will be informed by Z Elshamy about the study steps and maintenance of oral&#xD;
      hygiene instructions. Participants will be asked by Z Elshamy if they have any problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivation and enforcing the maintenance of oral hygiene measures by ZElshamy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visits will be designated as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Preoperative records, face-to-face adherence reminder session, clinical,&#xD;
      radiographic examination, intraoral photographs, and primary impression for diagnostic cast&#xD;
      construction. Visit 2: teeth preparation, secondary impression using addition silicone rubber&#xD;
      base material and temporary restoration. Visit 3: one week after the second visit, try in for&#xD;
      the restoration will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: placement and permanent cementation of the final restoration. Visit 5: Every 2&#xD;
      months post operatively follow-up visit for one year. Sample size: Since no previously&#xD;
      published effect size data regarding the effectiveness of neither the intervention nor the&#xD;
      control exist, an estimated sample of (20 restorations) would be used with allocation ratio&#xD;
      1:1 Recruitment: The patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria will be selected from the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic of the fixed prosthodontics department - Cairo University. Screening of&#xD;
      patients will be carried out until the target population is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Assignment of interventions (for controlled trial) Sequence generation. The&#xD;
      participant teeth will be allocated into two groups with 1:1 allocation ratio by using&#xD;
      computerized Sequence generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plans to promote participant retention &amp;complete follow up :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone numbers and address of the patient included in the study will be Recorded. All&#xD;
      patients will be given a phone call before the next appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: All data will be entered electronically. Patient files are to be stored in&#xD;
      Numerical order in a secured place. This will be carried out by ZElshamy Statistical methods&#xD;
      Data analysis All Data will be collected, checked, revised, tabulated and entered into the&#xD;
      computer by ZElshamy. Quantitative variables from the normal distribution will be expressed&#xD;
      as mean and standard deviation (SD) values. To test the significant differences between two&#xD;
      groups at different follow-up period's student t-test will be used. Significant level will be&#xD;
      set at P â‰¤ 0.05 Statistical analysis will be done using Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences, Version 21.0 (SPSS, IBM, Chicago, III, USA) for Windows. Data monitoring: The main&#xD;
      supervisor is responsible for data monitoring if harms arise, an interim analysis will be&#xD;
      done. (El Mahallawi O).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms: Any adverse effect of pain or even failure will be recorded, documented and treated.&#xD;
      Consent: Researcher will discuss the trial with all patients. Patients will then be able to&#xD;
      have an informed discussion with the researcher. A researcher will obtain written consent&#xD;
      from patients willing to participate in the trial. All consent forms will be in the Arabic&#xD;
      language Confidentiality :All study-related information will be stored securely. All&#xD;
      participants' information will be stored in locked file cabinets in areas with limited&#xD;
      access. All data collection, process, and administrative forms will be identified by a coded&#xD;
      ID [identification] number only to maintain participant confidentiality. All records that&#xD;
      contain names or other personal identifiers will be stored separately from study records&#xD;
      identified by code number. All local databases will be secured with password-protected access&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to data :The investigator and supervisors will be given access to the data sets. All&#xD;
      data sets will be password protected. To ensure confidentiality, Participant study&#xD;
      information will become confidentially Ancillary and post-trial care :All patients will be&#xD;
      followed up until complete period study&amp; patients' satisfactions occur. As any prosthetic&#xD;
      treatment post insertion adjustment is necessary and in this trial recalls maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination policy : Study results will be published as partial fulfillment of the&#xD;
      requirements for PHD degree in fixed prosthodontics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Topics suggested for presentation or publication will be circulated to the authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The fracture of the restoration of the two groups will be assessed using the&#xD;
      modified United States public health service ( USPHS) criteria Secondary outcome: Color&#xD;
      changes of the two groups will be assessed using the modified United States public health&#xD;
      service (USPHS) criteria&#xD;

    <description>In conventional preparation of veneer it circumvents the contact areas and extends palatally in the incisal third of the tooth only. The preparation thickness is defined by a 0.5 mm facial and 1.5-2.0 mm incisal reduction with the proximal finish lines placed facially to the proximal contacts&#xD;
Gull wing (dog leg) preparation is the inciso - proximal extension of porcelain laminates veneer margin more palatally. This preparation design helps to hide the restoration margin when viewed from an angle, especially in discoloration.&#xD;
