      The aim of the study is to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and&#xD;
      preference-based health utilities of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) carriers in different stages&#xD;
      of illness. It will also estimate the cost-effectiveness of anti-viral treatments resulting&#xD;
      from the prevention of the progression of disease from uncomplicated CHB carriers to&#xD;
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) have poorer health-related quality of life&#xD;
           (HRQOL) than the general population;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with more severe stages of chronic HB infections have lower health related&#xD;
           quality of life and health utility values;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anti-viral treatment can improve the HRQOL and health utility for patients with CHB&#xD;
           infections;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The cost-effectiveness of different treatments for chronic HBV infections can be&#xD;
           directly compared in terms of cost/QALY gained.&#xD;

      Design, Setting &amp; Subjects: A cross-sectional study and biomathematical modelling will be&#xD;
      carried out. In the cross-sectional study, patients known to CHB carriers will be identified&#xD;
      from the registries of the Ap Lei Chau, Aberdeen and Sai Yung Pun General Outpatient Clinics&#xD;
      and Queen Mary Hospital. The biomathematical modelling will use a simulated cohort of&#xD;
      patients aged 18 or above with CHB infections who may receive treatment in Hong Kong.&#xD;
      Published data on the benefit of anti-viral treatments and the cross-sectional study data on&#xD;
      preference-based health utility values of different stages of CHB infections will be used to&#xD;
      estimate the cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies using Markov modelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Each subject in the cross-sectional study will be interviewed. Five strategies&#xD;
      for management of CHB infections: 1) No treatment, 2) Interferon monotherapy, 3) lamivudine&#xD;
      monotherapy, 4) adefovir and 5) combined treatment of lamivudine and adefovir, will be tested&#xD;
      in the biomathematical modelling,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: Health-related quality of life measured by the SF-36, preference-based&#xD;
      health utilities measured by the SF-6D. quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost of&#xD;
      different treatment strategies for HBV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: HRQOL and health utilities of patients with different illness stages, and the&#xD;
      QALYs gained and cost-effectiveness of different therapeutic strategies will be established.&#xD;
      The results will provide information on the health burden of CHB infections, and evidence on&#xD;
      the cost-effectiveness of anti-viral treatments in preventing disease progression can be&#xD;
      directly compared.&#xD;

    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability.</description>

    <description>The Short Form-6 Dimension (SF-6D) is a widely used preference-based generic HRQOL measure with a multiattribute classification system consisting of six dimensions: physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, pain, mental health, and vitality. Each dimension is composed of three to five levels. The SF-6D values range from 0.315 to 1, with higher scores indicating better HRQOL anchoring on the 0 (dead) to 1 (full health) scale.</description>
