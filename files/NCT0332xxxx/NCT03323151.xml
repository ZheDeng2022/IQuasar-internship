    <textblock>
      Patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) that has relapsed (come back) or refractory&#xD;
      (progressed on treatment) will receive ixazomib and ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ibrutinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as treatment for&#xD;
      patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ixazomib is in a class of medications called proteasome inhibitors. Cancer cells depend on&#xD;
      proteasome to provide this protein metabolism (turnover) function to regulate their growth&#xD;
      and survival. Ixazomib disrupts a cancer cells' ability to survive by blocking the proteasome&#xD;
      and disrupting protein metabolism. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may&#xD;
      cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see whether the addition of ixazomib to ibrutinib&#xD;
      chemotherapy is effective in treating people who have relapsed or refractory MCL and to&#xD;
      examine the side effects associated with ixazomib in combination with ibrutinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MCL is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is considered incurable with conventional&#xD;
      therapy. For relapsed patients, Ibrutinib, lenalidomide, and bortezomib are all approved by&#xD;
      the FDA but are not curative. Novel approaches are required to improve outcomes for patients&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label study that will be done in 2 phases. Phase I will test different doses&#xD;
      of ixazomib and ibrutinib to determine the maximum safe and tolerated dose. In Phase I,&#xD;
      patients who have already received ibrutinib, may participate if they meet certain criteria&#xD;
      (i.e., have not received ibrutinib for at least 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I was completed November 25, 2019. Dose Level 2 (Ixazomib 4 mg and Ibrutinib 560 mg) is&#xD;
      the recommended Phase II dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will find out the effects, good and/or bad, of ixazomib in combination with&#xD;
      ibrutinib. In Phase II, patients will be separated into 2 groups, patients who have never&#xD;
      received a Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor and patients who have received a BTK&#xD;
      inhibitor. This study is designed to examine the effectiveness of this drug in treating&#xD;
      patients with MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated until progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments will be performed approximately every 3 months for the first year of&#xD;
      treatment, then every 6 months until progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandatory bone marrow and tumor tissue samples (i.e., obtained during a previous procedure or&#xD;
      biopsy) are required at baseline. Mandatory research blood samples will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8/7/2020: Enrollment stopped to patients who have already received a BTK inhibitor. Total of&#xD;
      two patients enrolled (1 in Phase I and 1 in Phase II).&#xD;
