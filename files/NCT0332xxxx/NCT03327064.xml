  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled biomarker study in renal transplant&#xD;
      recipients with actinic damage and a history of basal cell carcinomas and/or cutaneous&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinomas. There will be two arms to the study: 1) daily oral UAB30 for 28&#xD;
      days; and 2) daily oral placebo for 28 days. The total duration of the study is anticipated&#xD;
      to be 5 years. The hypothesis being tested is that a significantly greater percentage of&#xD;
      subjects randomized to oral UAB30 over a period of 28 days will achieve ≥30% reduction in&#xD;
      biomarkers of proliferation and ≥30% increase in apoptosis biomarkers than those who receive&#xD;
      placebo. Cyclin D1 will serve as the primary biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will determine whether subjects randomized to UAB30 have an increase in&#xD;
      all trans-retinoic acid responsive genes in the skin compared to those receiving placebo.&#xD;
      This will include an examination of target effects of UAB30 by evaluating its effects in vivo&#xD;
      in humans on the DNA damage response and Src signaling pathways.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), which include basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and cutaneous&#xD;
      squamous carcinomas (SCCs), are the most common malignancy in the U.S.; it is estimated that&#xD;
      &gt;3.5 million new NMSCs this year. This represents a tremendous economic impact on the U.S.&#xD;
      healthcare system. Most NMSC are caused by overexposure to ultraviolet radiation, and current&#xD;
      methods for their prevention consist of recommendations for limitations to sun exposure and&#xD;
      avoidance of indoor tanning beds, the regular application of sunscreens, and a variety of&#xD;
      other photoprotective activities. Despite these measures, the incidence of NMSCs continues to&#xD;
      rise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NMSCs are a particular problem for organ transplant recipients (OTRs), who must take&#xD;
      medicines to protect against rejection of their transplanted organ. These drugs suppress the&#xD;
      host immune response that serves to identify and eliminate mutant and neoplastic&#xD;
      keratinocytes before they can progress to clinically apparent cancers. Recent research&#xD;
      indicates that these drugs also augment signal transduction pathways involved in skin tumor&#xD;
      development. NMSCs develop much more frequently in long-term recipients of renal allografts&#xD;
      and once present, they behave more aggressively. In immunosuppressed patients, the risk of&#xD;
      developing SCCs is 65250-fold higher than in the general population, and the risk of BCCs is&#xD;
      10-fold greater. The rate of SCC metastases in organ transplant recipients is 7%, which is&#xD;
      much higher than the general population. For this reason, there has been great interest in&#xD;
      identifying novel agents for chemoprevention, which are suitable for use by OTRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two groups to the study. Individuals, aged 18 years or older, who have had a&#xD;
      renal transplant but are in otherwise general good health, will be given UAB30 (160 mg/day)&#xD;
      and will be compared to individuals, aged 18 years or older, who have had a renal transplant&#xD;
      and are in otherwise general good health who are given placebo. All participants must be at&#xD;
      increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer as evidenced by a history of prior squamous or&#xD;
      basal cell skin cancer, ongoing or history of actinic keratoses, and the presence, at&#xD;
      baseline, of at least eight actinic keratoses on the face, neck, scalp and arms. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to 28 days of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. UAB30 at 160 mg/day, renal transplant recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. placebo renal transplant recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline screening, informed consent will be obtained and skin will be examined for&#xD;
      potential non-melanoma skin cancers. Any lesions that are clinically suspicious for&#xD;
      non-melanoma skin cancer will be removed per standard of care prior to administration of&#xD;
      drug. Actinic keratoses will not be removed during the 28 day study period. Two weeks later,&#xD;
      once any lesions clinically suspicious for non-melanoma skin cancer have been removed, renal&#xD;
      transplant recipients will be randomized to one of the treatment arms described above.&#xD;
      Participants will return at 28 days and 112 days for assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At randomization and 28 days, 6mm punch biopsies, or the equivalent deep shave biopsies,&#xD;
           will be taken for individual biomarkers from non-sun exposed skin, chronically sun&#xD;
           exposed skin, and a pre-identified AK. The chronically sun-exposed skin to be biopsied&#xD;
           will be no less than 1 cm from the AK to be biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At baseline, at 28 days and at the end of study AK lesions will be assessed and counted,&#xD;
           employing techniques that have been validated in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All lesions suspicious for skin cancer will be biopsied and treated appropriately (per&#xD;
           standard of care) throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adverse events will be assessed, including NMSC and melanoma, from signing of the&#xD;
           informed consent through the end of the trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  WBC ≥ 3000/mm3; platelets ≥ 100,000mm3, hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin ≤ upper limit of institutional normal&#xD;

          -  Participants with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing, recurrent or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements. Depression is not exclusionary, but&#xD;
             the investigator should make the determination if patients with depression are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with UAB30, breastfeeding must be discontinued&#xD;
             for the duration of study participation and for one month after the last dose of the&#xD;
             study agent if the mother is treated with UAB30.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals known to be HIV-positive may not participate in this study. The uncertain&#xD;
             immune status of HIV-positive people and the potential risks of taking part in this&#xD;
             study are too great to justify a study with low likelihood of benefit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of cancer diagnosis or reoccurrence &lt;5 years from study&#xD;
             entry may not participate. However, individuals with a history of squamous or basal&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the skin &lt;5 years from study entry will not be excluded from this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because of the uncertain risk of UAB30 to unborn fetuses and children, pregnant women&#xD;
             and children will not be allowed in this study&#xD;
