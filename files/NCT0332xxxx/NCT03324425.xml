      This study recruits patients with metastatic breast cancer who have progressed on their&#xD;
      current regimen of dual anti-HER2 therapy. This study evaluates whether or not the addition&#xD;
      of simvastatin to the dual anti-HER2 therapy regimen helps make the tumor respond to the&#xD;
      anti-HER2 therapy again. All participants will receive simvastatin in combination with their&#xD;
      current anti-HER2 therapy regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is recruiting participants with metastatic breast cancer that is HER2 positive.&#xD;
      &quot;Metastatic&quot; means that cancer has spread to areas of the body outside of the breast. &quot;HER2&#xD;
      positive&quot; means that a cancer cell has too many HER2 receptors on its surface. HER2 receptors&#xD;
      act like copy machines, and help tell cancer cells to grow and multiply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs known as HER2-targeted therapies are often used to treat HER2-positive cancers.&#xD;
      HER2-targeted therapies work by blocking the HER2 protein from telling the cell to grow and&#xD;
      divide. Once the protein stops working, the cancer cells can no longer make copies of&#xD;
      themselves. Once a cancer cell becomes unable to make copies of itself, the tumor will start&#xD;
      to shrink. However, some tumors are able to find other ways to make copies of themselves,&#xD;
      even when the HER2 protein is blocked. When this happens, the cancer will start to grow&#xD;
      again. Researchers believe that adding a drug called simvastatin to an anti-HER2 therapy&#xD;
      regimen may cause the cancer to start responding again to your HER2-medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simvastatin is a drug that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat&#xD;
      high cholesterol. Laboratory research has shown that simvastatin together with dual&#xD;
      HER2-targeted therapy slows the growth of breast cancer tumors that had been growing on dual&#xD;
      HER2-targeting therapy alone.&#xD;
