      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dopamine (DA) is a chemical signal in the brain linked to learning, memory, and habits.&#xD;
      Stimulant drugs like methylphenidate can increase DA in the brain. Researchers want to&#xD;
      measure DA with and without this drug. They want to learn how methylphenidate and brain&#xD;
      dopamine affect body responses, mood, and thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the role of dopamine in the brain and the effects of methylphenidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-55 who have used alcohol or stimulant drugs but have no drug dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Question about medical, psychiatric, and alcohol and drug use history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions to see if it s safe to have a PET/MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath test for alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 or 4 study visits. At each visit they will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine and breath tested for alcohol and drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A thin plastic tube (catheter) inserted in each arm by needle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small amount of radioactive chemical injected through the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET/MRI scan. Participants will lie still on a table that slides in and out of a metal&#xD;
           cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Their vital signs will be monitored.&#xD;
           They will get earmuffs for loud noises. Before the scan, participants will get the study&#xD;
           drug or placebo through the catheter. They may also get a sugar pill (placebo). They&#xD;
           will get a small meal and have blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of memory, attention, and thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear an activity monitor on the wrist for one week.&#xD;

      Objectives: The overarching goal of this study is to assess the dynamic association between&#xD;
      dopamine (DA) D2 receptor (D2R) occupancy measured by positron emission tomography (PET) with&#xD;
      [11C]raclopride and brain activity inferred by pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (phMRI) in the human brain, and to assess the relative sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      neurovascular coupling for slow (oral) versus rapid (intravenous, IV) stimulant&#xD;
      methylphenidate (MP) delivery. Secondary objectives are to assess the associations between&#xD;
      behavioral measures (heart and respiration rates and blood pressure, motor and sleep&#xD;
      parameters, and neuropsychological testing variables), D2R occupancy and fMRI signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 10 healthy males and 10 healthy females 18-55 years old will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Double-blind. Participants will undergo simultaneous PET/phMRI, to evaluate dynamic&#xD;
      changes in D2R occupancy by DA with [11C]raclopride and in blood-oxygenation-level dependent&#xD;
      (BOLD) signals, under MP or placebo (PL). The participants will be scanned on 3 different&#xD;
      occasions: 1) oral-MP (60 mg) and iv PL (3 cc saline), 2) oral-PL and iv-MP (0.25 mg/kg in 3&#xD;
      cc sterile water) and 3) oral PL and iv PL, which will be carried in different study days&#xD;
      with at least 48 hours between them and their order will be randomized across subjects.&#xD;
      Participants and researchers will be blind to the nature of the stimulant drug (MP/PL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters: The scale factor between the distribution volume ratio (DVR) and the BOLD&#xD;
      signal in the dorsal and ventral striatum for the slow and fast MP challenges.&#xD;

             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had previous radiation exposure (from X-rays, PET scans, or other exposure) that,&#xD;

          -  Presence of ferromagnetic objects in the body that are contraindicated for PET/phMRI&#xD;
             of the head (pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some&#xD;
             types of dental implants, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, permanent eyeliner,&#xD;
             implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments), fear of enclosed spaces, or other&#xD;
             standard contraindication to MRI/MRS (elf-report checklist).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cannot lie comfortably flat on back for up to 2 hours in the PET/phMRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt; 204 kg (&gt; 450 lbs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to methylphenidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant EKG abnormalities. Clinically significant findings on EKG will&#xD;
             be assessed by the Medical Advisory Investigator on the study or through a cardiology&#xD;
             consult. EKG reviews are documented in CRIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of glaucoma as determined by medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NIH employees who are study investigators, as well as their superiors, subordinates&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Non-English speakers (must also be able to read and comprehend English).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will not be excluded from enrollment in this study if their urine test is positive&#xD;
        for drugs. However, if they test positive on scheduled study procedure days involving study&#xD;
        imaging and neuropsychological testing, the procedures will be postponed and rescheduled.&#xD;
        We will allow for up to 3 rescheduled study days that were the result of positive urine&#xD;
        drug screens. If the drug test is positive on the third rescheduled visit, the participant&#xD;
        will be withdrawn from the study. The intent of the research has no prospect of direct&#xD;
        benefit to the subject. Therefore, we are excluding non-English speakers in this research&#xD;
        study since it includes the administration of questionnaires, surveys and assessments that&#xD;
        are validated for English, although some are available in Spanish. In addition,&#xD;
&#xD;
        our fMRI paradigms (particularly the Delay Discounting task) require that the subject be&#xD;
        able to speak, read and comprehend English.&#xD;
