      In this case-control study, the investigators compare shoulder muscle function, pain, and&#xD;
      central nervous system sensitization in patients with Subacromial Pain (SAP) to that in&#xD;
      healthy controls. The investigators also examine if a relationship exists between shoulder&#xD;
      symptom duration and central sensitization, shoulder muscle function and shoulder pain&#xD;
      distribution in patients with SAP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subacromial pain (SAP), also referred to as subacromial impingement syndrome, is&#xD;
      characterized by pain in the shoulder joint, which is aggravated by elevation of the arm and&#xD;
      / or during overhead activities. Subacromial pain has been suggested to be an &quot;end station&quot;&#xD;
      to numerous pathologies of the shoulder and can be considered to include a variety of&#xD;
      symptoms, and not to be seen only as a single diagnosis. In Denmark, SAP is frequently&#xD;
      reported as a cause of pain in the shoulder joint, and based on studies from Sweden and the&#xD;
      Netherlands, is estimated to cost the Danish society around 1.35 billion. DKK annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to compare central nervous system sensitization (central&#xD;
      sensitization), shoulder muscle function and shoulder pain distribution in patients with&#xD;
      subacromial pain to that in pain free healthy matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of this study is to investigate if (symptom) dose/response relationships&#xD;
      exist between shoulder symptom duration and: central sensitization, shoulder muscle function&#xD;
      and shoulder pain distribution in patients with subacromial pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the present study is exploratory, it is the working hypothesis that i) patients with&#xD;
      subacromial pain have increased central sensitization, reduced shoulder muscle function, and&#xD;
      increased pain distribution when compared to healthy controls, and ii) symptom dose/response&#xD;
      relationships exist, indicated by increased central sensitization, reduced shoulder muscle&#xD;
      function, and increased pain distribution with longer symptom duration in patients with&#xD;
      subacromial pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology includes: surface EMG recordings to quantify shoulder muscle activity;&#xD;
      dynamometry to quantify maximal voluntary contraction force and submaximal isometric force&#xD;
      steadiness; mechanical and computer-controlled algometry to quantify CNS sensitization;&#xD;
      computerized pain drawings to quantify pain distribution; and patient-reported assessments of&#xD;
      shoulder pain (SPADI) and catastrophizing (PCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not include any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is considered exploratory and the first in a line of studies using these&#xD;
      outcome measures in this patient population. All outcomes listed below are valued equally, as&#xD;
      the study is exploratory. All analyses will be used to indicate effect sizes in order to plan&#xD;
      for subsequent follow-up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the study is considered exploratory, the statistical approach includes the&#xD;
      pre-defined primary and secondary analyses outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis: The primary analysis will compare 36 included patients to 36 matched&#xD;
      healthy controls regarding the 3 main outcomes: shoulder muscle function, CNS sensitization&#xD;
      and shoulder pain distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis: The secondary analysis will compare the three subgroups of patients&#xD;
      differing in their symptom duration (0.5-3 months of pain, 3-6 months of pain and +6 months&#xD;
      of pain), regarding the 3 main outcomes: CNS sensitization, shoulder muscle function, and&#xD;
      shoulder pain distribution, to indicate (symptom) dose/response relationships, using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. The symptom duration groups may be redefined, if recruitment is slow&#xD;
      for one or more of the groups outlined above.&#xD;
