      Patients with cirrhosis of viral etiology (HCV/HBV); Patients with cirrhosis of any other&#xD;
      etiology (alcohol, idiopatic, autoimmune). Planned Number of cirrhotic subjects 200 patients&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria Subjects (18 yr old) with liver cirrhosis of any etiology, Exclusion&#xD;
      Criteria All patients should not have hepatocellular carcinoma or other malignant tumors,&#xD;
      they should not be treated with anticoagulant / antiplatelet agents, not affected by PVT&#xD;
      already diagnosed and not suffering from congenital coagulation disorders (haemophilia A / B,&#xD;
      von disease Willebrand, another congenital deficiency of coagulation factors) or severe&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (&lt;30,000 Plt / μL). Subject has participated in another clinical study&#xD;
      within 30 days prior to study enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical&#xD;
      study on cirrhosis Primary Objective To describe the prospective modification of ADAMTS-13&#xD;
      level and other coagulation variables (e.g. FVIII, VWF:Ag/VWF:act) in cirrhotic patients&#xD;
      during 18 months from the enrolment and to verify their predictive role as biomarker of&#xD;
      development of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) Secondary Objectives To describe prospectively&#xD;
      the modification of ADAMTS-13 level as a function of the etiology of cirrhosis Statistical&#xD;
      analysis The total duration of the study will be of 12 months. The sample size of 200&#xD;
      subjects will be selected as a feasible number of patients to be recruited in a period of six&#xD;
      months. The patients will be consecutively enrolled and followed for 18 months. As a result,&#xD;
      in a follow up period of 18 months about 20-25 cases of PVT are expected. Continuous&#xD;
      variables will be expressed as means ± standard deviations. In addition to descriptive&#xD;
      statistics (location parameters), univariate analysis will be performed on each parameter and&#xD;
      development of PVT during the follow up period. In previous observational studies both 1) a&#xD;
      reduced PV flow [prospectively] and 2) a reduction of ADAMTS-13 are significantly associated&#xD;
      with PVT. These associations will be investigated prospectively and analyzed simultaneously&#xD;
      by a multivariate analysis and ROC curve to establish the sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      these parameters as predictors of PVT development. Analyses will be performed using available&#xD;
      data&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The occurrence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) radically changes&#xD;
      the prognosis of cirrhotic patients, particularly those awaiting liver transplantation. If&#xD;
      this happens, it occurs in about 8-10% / year in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver&#xD;
      transplantation. Some studies have suggested the involvement of various risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of PVT in cirrhotic patients, including the classic congenital and acquired&#xD;
      thrombophilic conditions [1-6], although contributions of our research group have shown that&#xD;
      a key element in the development of PVT in these patients is the decreased velocity of portal&#xD;
      blood flow [7, 8]. The possible contribution of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and&#xD;
      ADAMTS-13, produced by the liver stellate cells [9], for the development of PVT is rather&#xD;
      poorly documented. In a recent observational study of the proponent [10], conducted on 84&#xD;
      patients with liver cirrhosis, it was found that the level of circulating ADAMTS-13 is&#xD;
      significantly lower in the group with PVT (median = 16.8% vs. 69.1%, p = 0.0047) and&#xD;
      independently associated with the presence of portal thrombosis (p = 0.007). However, given&#xD;
      the non-longitudinal nature of the study, it is possible that the decreased level of&#xD;
      ADAMTS-13 observed is the consequence and not the cause of PVT. It is also yet to investigate&#xD;
      the association of ADAMTS-13 level with the specific etiology of cirrhosis (viral, alcoholic,&#xD;
      idiopathic, etc.) and the resulting inflammation during the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study Period(s) and Subject Participation Two hundred (200) patients,&#xD;
      consecutively enrolled in a period of about 6 months, will be followed for 18 months from the&#xD;
      enrolment. As a result, in the subsequent 18 months about 20-25 cases of PVT will be&#xD;
      expected. All patients will sign an informed consent. The severity of liver function failure&#xD;
      will be assessed using the Child-Pugh score [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint To describe in a prospective way the association of both basal ADAMTS-13&#xD;
      level and portal vein flow with development of PVT in cirrhotic patients during 18 months&#xD;
      from the enrolment. Secondary Endpoints To describe prospectively the modification of&#xD;
      ADAMTS-13 level as a function of the etiology of cirrhosis Coagulation and biochemical&#xD;
      parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective study will measure the following biochemical and coagulation parameters at&#xD;
      each follow-up visit, scheduled at interval of 4 months according to routine controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coagulation and thrombophilia factors All blood samples will be drawn under fasting&#xD;
      conditions in the morning. Determinations of PT, APTT, fibrinogen, antithrombin, protein C,&#xD;
      protein S, lupus anticoagulant, FVIII (two-stage chromogenic assay) and D-dimer will be&#xD;
      carried out on an automatic coagulometer (ACL Top 700, IL). VWF-antigen VWF:activity will be&#xD;
      measured in plasma samples by chemiluminescence assays. VWF multimer (VWFm) pattern was&#xD;
      measured as previously reported [10]. FV Leiden R506Q and prothrombin G20210A genotyping of&#xD;
      these polymorphisms was performed by using commercial kits based on PCR-RT-based method (from&#xD;
      EliTechGroup S.p.A., Torino, Italy) on an automatic instrument (Model 7300, Applied&#xD;
      Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of ADAMTS-13 activity. ADAMTS-13 activity was measured in citrated plasma samples&#xD;
      by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay using a VWF86 amino-acid&#xD;
      peptide substrate contained in a commercial kit from Instrumentation Laboratory (ADAMTS-13&#xD;
      activity, Werfen Group, Milano, Italy) and a Varian Eclipse spectrofluorometer, as previously&#xD;
      detailed [10, 13] and expressed as % of normal plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Chemistry assays. All clinical chemistry assays (plasma albumin, creatinine,&#xD;
      alanine-leucine-amino-transferase (ALT) and total bilirubin) will be performed as a part of&#xD;
      routine diagnostic work-up within 24 hours of clinical observation in the central laboratory&#xD;
      of the &quot;A. Gemelli&quot; Hospital, using heparinized plasma samples and commercial reagents from&#xD;
      Siemens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives. The secondary objectives of analyzing the levels of ADAMTS-13 and VWF&#xD;
      as a function of the etiology of cirrhosis will be further assessed only after a certified&#xD;
      diagnosis of the particular etiologic of cirrhosis. In the case of HCV-associated cirrhosis&#xD;
      also the genotype of HCV will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent and Enrollment Any patient who will provide informed consent (i.e., signs&#xD;
      and dates the informed consent form and assent form, if applicable) and will meet all other&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Identification Code. The following series of numbers will comprise the subject&#xD;
      identification code (SIC): protocol acronym (ADAPTHRO), and 2-digit subject number (e.g.,&#xD;
      01….02) reflecting the order of enrollment (i.e., signing the informed consent form). For&#xD;
      example, the third subject who signed an informed consent form will be identified as&#xD;
      ADAPTHRO-03. All study documents (e.g., CRFs, clinical documentation, etc.) will be&#xD;
      identified with the SIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Study Visits The study site is responsible for maintaining an&#xD;
      enrollment/screening log that includes all subjects enrolled. The log also will serve to&#xD;
      document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported&#xD;
      in CRFs, regardless of screening outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Completion/Discontinuation A subject is considered to have completed the study when&#xD;
      he/she ceases active participation in the study because the subject has, or is presumed to&#xD;
      have, completed the study according to the protocol, participated for the specified&#xD;
      observational time and when the study exit form has been completed. Reasons for&#xD;
      completion/discontinuation will be reported on the Completion/ Discontinuation CRF page,&#xD;
      including: completed, screen failure, adverse event (e.g., death), discontinuation by subject&#xD;
      (e.g., lost to follow-up [defined as 3 documented unsuccessful attempts to contact the&#xD;
      subject], dropout), physician decision (e.g., pregnancy, progressive disease, protocol&#xD;
      violation(s)), Vital Signs Vital signs will include height (cm) and weight (kg). Height and&#xD;
      weight will be collected, if available, at screening visit, each annual interval visit, and&#xD;
      study completion/termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Planned Statistical Analysis Continuous variables will be expressed as&#xD;
      means ± standard deviations. Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages. Fisher's exact tests and/or Chi-Square tests will be mainly used to compare&#xD;
      qualitative variables and Student's t-test for quantitative unpaired data. A p-value &lt; 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant in an exploratory sense. In addition to&#xD;
      descriptive statistics (location parameters), and univariate analysis, multivariate analyses&#xD;
      are planned. Independent variables that will be found associated with PVT in univariate&#xD;
      analysis with p&lt;0.05 will be used as independent covariates associated with PVT in the next&#xD;
      18 months in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. A two-sided p &lt;0.05 was defined&#xD;
      as statistically significant. Analyses will be performed using SPSS software (version 21,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent. Investigators will choose patients for enrollment based on the study&#xD;
      eligibility criteria.The investigator will exercise no selectivity so that no bias is&#xD;
      introduced from this source. All patients must sign an informed consent form before entering&#xD;
      into the study according to applicable regulatory requirements. Before use, the informed&#xD;
      consent form will be reviewed by the EC. By signing the informed consent form, patients agree&#xD;
      to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality Policy The investigator will comply with the confidentiality policy as&#xD;
      described in the Non- Interventional Trial Agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Documents and Case Report Forms The investigator will maintain complete and accurate&#xD;
      study documentation in a separate file. Documentation may include medical records, records&#xD;
      detailing the progress of the study for each subject, signed informed consent forms,&#xD;
      correspondence with the EC, enrollment and screening information, CRFs and laboratory&#xD;
      reports. The investigator will comply with the procedures for data recording and reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Document and Data Retention The investigator will retain study documentation and data in&#xD;
      accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the document and data retention&#xD;
      policy, as described in the Non-Interventional Study Agreement.&#xD;

        - Patients with liver cirrhosis of any etiology, diagnosed using imaging and/or&#xD;
        histological criteria and observed in the Liver Unit of the &quot;A. Gemelli&quot; University will be&#xD;
        included in this study. All patients will sign an informed consent. The severity of liver&#xD;
        function failure will be assessed using the Child-Pugh score [11]. Upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
        endoscopy will be performed in all patients; the size of esophageal varices will be&#xD;
        recorded as well as the presence of previous episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding. All the&#xD;
        subjects will be outpatients and the time interval between the follow up visits will be&#xD;
        approximately 120 days. The ultrasound criteria for the diagnosis of PVT will be the&#xD;
        detection of echogenic material within one or more of the following vessels: portal trunk,&#xD;
        right portal branch, left portal branch, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein. Color&#xD;
        and pulsed Doppler analysis will allow to confirm the diagnosis and to distinguish partial&#xD;
        from complete obstructive thrombosis and in all cases the Doppler ultrasound diagnosis of&#xD;
        PVT will be confirmed by contrast enhanced abdomen computed tomography. The presence and/or&#xD;
        extension of the thrombosis to the other major vessels of the portal venous system&#xD;
        (mesenteric or splenic vein) will registered in all patients. PVT will be classified&#xD;
        according to the extension of thrombosis, as previously reported: grade I is referred to as&#xD;
        portal thrombosis confined to the portal vein beyond the confluence of the splenic vein;&#xD;
        grade II was a PVT extended to the superior mesenteric vein, but with patent mesenteric&#xD;
        vessels; grade III is a PVT extended to the whole splanchnic venous system, but with large&#xD;
        collaterals; grade IV is a thrombosis extended to the whole splanchnic venous system with&#xD;
        only fine collaterals [12]. All the biochemical and coagulation parameters described below,&#xD;
        including ADAMTS-13 and VWF levels, will be measured at each follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
