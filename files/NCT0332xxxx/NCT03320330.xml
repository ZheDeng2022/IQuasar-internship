    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pepinemab and to see how well&#xD;
      it works in treating younger patients with solid tumors that have come back after treatment,&#xD;
      or do not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pepinemab,&#xD;
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of pepinemab&#xD;
      (VX15/2503) administered as an intravenous infusion every 14 days to children with recurrent&#xD;
      or refractory solid tumors. (Part A) II. To define and describe the toxicities of VX15/2503&#xD;
      administered on this schedule. (Parts A-B) III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      VX15/2503 in children with recurrent or refractory cancer. (Parts A-B) IV. To preliminarily&#xD;
      define the antitumor activity of VX15/2503 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      osteosarcoma. (Part B) V. To determine if VX15/2503 either improves the disease control rate&#xD;
      at 4 months in patients with recurrent measurable osteosarcoma or produces an objective&#xD;
      response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. (Part B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the pharmacodynamics of VX15/2503 through VX15/2503 saturation of T-lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the immunogenicity of VX15/2503 in pediatric patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate potential biomarkers of VX15/2503 sensitivity including SEMA4D, PlexinB1, and&#xD;
      other markers of immune cell infiltration in archival tumor tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pepinemab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
