  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obese men in rural Northeast Nebraska are an unrepresented, at-risk group&#xD;
      exhibiting rising rates of cardiovascular disease, poor access to preventive care, and a&#xD;
      rural milieu that contributes to their sedentary physical activity and unhealthy diet. This&#xD;
      study proposes to use a pragmatic randomized controlled trial and community engaged research&#xD;
      approaches to 1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a commercially available,&#xD;
      smart phone self-monitoring app (premium-version) plus text-based coaching and daily weighing&#xD;
      via Wi-Fi scale intervention for achieving weight loss, 2) determine preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      this intervention group to a comparison group receiving only a self-monitoring app&#xD;
      (basic-version) in achieving the outcomes of weight loss (kilogram) and improved dietary and&#xD;
      physical activity behaviors (secondary) at 6 months post-baseline, and 3) determine&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative indicators of community capacity to support a contextually&#xD;
      relevant weight loss intervention. Eighty men (ages 40-69) with body mass index of 28 or&#xD;
      higher, randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to intervention group or comparison group. Men will&#xD;
      complete baseline assessments (weight, % body fat, body mass index height, blood pressure,&#xD;
      health history, dietary intake, physical activity frequency/intensity) and receive&#xD;
      orientation to the mobile technologies (app features, text messaging, Wi-Fi scale). Men will&#xD;
      track their dietary intake, physical activity, and weight on the app for 12 weeks. After the&#xD;
      3-month intervention, post-measure assessments (weight, % body fat, BMI, dietary intake, PA&#xD;
      frequency/intensity, technology usability surveys) will be collected at 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      post-baseline. At 6 months post-baseline, two groups (n=8 each) of intervention completers&#xD;
      will be purposively selected to share their perceptions of the intervention efficacy in an&#xD;
      evaluative focus group. A community advisory board comprising local leaders within the men's&#xD;
      social network, together with investigators and rural student nurses will guide community&#xD;
      outreach efforts for study recruitment, implementation and evaluation. Study findings will be&#xD;
      evaluated with the community to inform local dissemination, future intervention revision, and&#xD;
      determination of community capacity for support of a larger clinical trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health problem that disproportionately affects rural men and&#xD;
      promotes the development of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      arthritis, and cancer. This study proposes to evaluate a mobile self-monitoring application&#xD;
      (app) with Wi-Fi scale and text messaging intervention (MT+: mobile technology plus) for&#xD;
      achieving weight loss in overweight and obese rural men. This proposal aligns with 1) Healthy&#xD;
      People 2020's aim to eliminate health disparities by increasing physical activity and&#xD;
      reducing obesity in adults; 2) the NIH's strategic plan to prioritize obesity reduction&#xD;
      research among underserved rural populations; and, 3) the NINR's strategic focus on&#xD;
      technology to promote health. Sixty nine percent of rural men in Nebraska are overweight or&#xD;
      obese with increasing prevalence during midlife 40-59 (40%) and older (36%). Rural men are&#xD;
      more likely to smoke, be obese, be physically inactive, and have shorter lifespans (2 years)&#xD;
      than urban men. Rural men are also more likely to be uninsured/underinsured, less likely to&#xD;
      engage in preventive health services, and report overall poorer health than urban men.&#xD;
      Despite the burden of obesity, no self-monitoring mobile technology interventions targeting&#xD;
      weight loss in rural, U.S. males exist, though the investigators preliminary study&#xD;
      demonstrated rural men will use mobile technology for eating and activity self-monitoring.&#xD;
      Studies show self-monitoring as one of the most effective behavior-change techniques for&#xD;
      weight loss. MT+ provides an accessible means of real-time self-monitoring support for&#xD;
      targeting lifestyle behaviors that lead to weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a MT+ intervention for weight loss in&#xD;
      overweight and obese men in a practical, real-life rural environment. This 6-month pilot RCT&#xD;
      includes a 3-month intervention with 6-month post-baseline follow-up. The intervention group&#xD;
      (n=40) will receive a 3-month MT+ intervention using a commercially available,&#xD;
      premium-version mobile phone app with social comparison group, behavior change text&#xD;
      messaging, and daily self-weighing via Wi-Fi scale. The comparison group (n=40) will receive&#xD;
      the basic-version mobile phone app only (MT). Primary efficacy outcome will be loss of body&#xD;
      weight (kg &amp; % body weight) at 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be improved diet and&#xD;
      increased physical activity (PA). A multi-method formative evaluation of the intervention&#xD;
      (student outreach, community advisory board (CAB), community capacity surveys, focus group,&#xD;
      community dissemination) will occur across the study. Primary feasibility outcomes will&#xD;
      include recruitment/retention rates and community resource development for program&#xD;
      sustainment. The multi-modal feedback will help 1) facilitate recruitment of a hard-to-reach&#xD;
      population, and 2) inform intervention feasibility and acceptability. These local insights&#xD;
      may foster minimized attrition and improve future study outcomes. The specific aims of this&#xD;
      study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a MT+ intervention for achieving&#xD;
      weight loss in rural overweight and obese men. The aim will specifically address groups by&#xD;
      the 1) participation rates including number of men recruited and randomized over a 6 month&#xD;
      period. 2) retention rates, 3) feasibility, usability, satisfaction ratings, 4) adherence&#xD;
      record of logging by men in the intervention group, and 5) evaluative focus group feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: Determine preliminary efficacy of a MT+ intervention to a comparison group receiving&#xD;
      only a basic self-monitoring app (MT) in achieving 1) weight loss (primary), and 2) improved&#xD;
      dietary and PA behavior (secondary) at 6 months post-baseline in rural men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: Determine quantitative and qualitative indicators of community capacity (resource&#xD;
      mobilization, learning opportunities-skills development, partnership linkages, participatory&#xD;
      decision-making, leadership) to support a relevant weight loss intervention for rural men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a collaborative process guided by Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) approaches with a&#xD;
      community-academic partnership involving UNMC students, community leaders, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to create and disseminate local knowledge about obesity in rural men. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to 1) document the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      a weight loss intervention among rural men, a current gap in the NIH health disparities&#xD;
      portfolio, 2) engage rural communities through student-informed outreach approaches and CAB&#xD;
      partnership linkages to improve the efficacy of weight loss interventions for rural men, and&#xD;
      3) strengthen the research environment of the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)&#xD;
      institution through providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to&#xD;
      conduct CEnR.&#xD;
