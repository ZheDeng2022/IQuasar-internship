  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, crossover trial to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness of red blood cells (RBCs) derived from Mirasol-treated whole blood (WB) versus&#xD;
      conventional RBCs in transfusion dependent thalassemia patients. Throughout the clinical&#xD;
      study, RBC transfusion volume and frequency will be determined by each subject's treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either Mirasol-treated RBCs followed by&#xD;
      conventional RBCs, or to receive conventional RBCs followed by Mirasol-treated RBCs. The&#xD;
      blood centers will collect the donor RBCs and supply the Mirasol-treated RBCs to the hospital&#xD;
      sites for transfusion into patients. Hospital sites will order conventional RBCs as per their&#xD;
      normal process, from their standard vendor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood transfusion is the mainstay of care for individuals with thalassemia major. The purpose&#xD;
      of transfusion is twofold: to improve the anemia and to suppress the ineffective&#xD;
      erythropoiesis. A transfusion episode for these thalassemia patients are the routine&#xD;
      transfusions administered on a regular schedule for the life of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The crossover trial design will consist of 2 treatment periods. Each period will include a 50&#xD;
      day wash-in phase (Day 0 of the wash-in = Day 0 of the treatment period) followed by 2&#xD;
      transfusion episodes. An end of study treatment follow-up visit will occur 2-4 weeks after&#xD;
      the last per protocol transfusion, prior to the next standard of care transfusion. A final&#xD;
      study visit will occur at least 60 days after the last per protocol transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the PRAISE study is to determine if percent survival of RBCs derived&#xD;
      from Mirasol-treated WB is non-inferior to conventional RBCs when transfused into patients&#xD;
      requiring chronic RBC transfusion support. The secondary objectives include comparing other&#xD;
      efficacy and safety endpoints between treatment groups.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Crossover design with 2 treatment periods. Each period included a 50-day wash-in followed by 2 transfusion episodes for primary endpoint assessment. Expected participation was approximately 7-10 months, depending on the subject's transfusion schedule.</time_frame>
    <description>The Hb AUC is calculated using the trapezoidal method on normalized Hb. The normalization is accomplished by dividing all posttransfusion Hb values by the 15-minute posttransfusion Hb level. The ratio is expressed as a percentage. A natural log-transform of the observed normalized Hb AUC will be utilized.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>This was a crossover study, all 9 randomized subjects were to receive both Mirasol and Reference RBCs in either period 1 or 2. 4 subjects were randomized to the MIR/REF RBC treatment sequence and 5 subjects were randomized to the REF/MIR RBC sequence. 4 subjects completed period 1, no subjects completed period 2 due to study suspension.

        <time_frame>Crossover design with 2 treatment periods. Each period included a 50-day wash-in followed by 2 transfusion episodes for primary endpoint assessment. Expected participation was approximately 7-10 months, depending on the subject's transfusion schedule.</time_frame>
        <population>The full Statistical Analysis Plan was not executed for this study because the study was stopped prematurely. 97 subjects were planned to be enrolled however only 12 subjects enrolled and 9 were randomized. Of the 9 randomized, no subjects completed the study due to early termination of the study.

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The primary endpoint was not evaluated due to the early termination of the study and subsequent small sample size with no subjects completing both Period 1 and Period 2 of the study preventing any meaningful results.</limitations_and_caveats>
