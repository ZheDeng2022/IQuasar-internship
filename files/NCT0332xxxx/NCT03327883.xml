      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder cancer is a common cancer in the U.S. Survival rates for metastatic bladder cancer&#xD;
      have not gotten better for 15 years. Diagnosing and assessing the disease is important for&#xD;
      treating it. The best way to tell what stage a cancer is in is computed tomography. This is&#xD;
      also called CT. But it does not always give the best images of the bladder. Adding a test&#xD;
      called positron emission tomography (PET) can help. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is even&#xD;
      better than CT for detecting bladder cancer. But it is not widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people with bladder cancer have already had MRI/PET and CT. Researchers want to study&#xD;
      their records. They want to compare the different ways of assessing the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the use of MRI/PET for diagnosing and treating metastatic bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years and older who were in studies between 2013 and 2016&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will study existing records. There will be no active participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The records will have no data that could identify the participants. Data will be stored on&#xD;
      secure computers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study participants will be contacted without approval from a review board.&#xD;

      This protocol is a chart review of the diagnostic imaging and management of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic bladder cancer who have undergone PET MRI. The study will involve only review of&#xD;
      patient records and will not use specimens or participant contact. The participants whose&#xD;
      records will be reviewed in this protocol were enrolled on a number of different protocols&#xD;
      between 2013 and 2016.&#xD;
