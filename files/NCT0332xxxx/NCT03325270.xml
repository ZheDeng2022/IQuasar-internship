      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the WHO, iron deficiency is still the most common and widespread nutritional&#xD;
      disorder in the world. Current iron supplements have limitations in terms of bioavailability&#xD;
      and tolerability. Prebiotic fibers, such as galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), selectively&#xD;
      enhance growth of beneficial colonic bacteria. Prebiotics in general enhance the production&#xD;
      of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and thereby decrease luminal pH. Through the reduction in&#xD;
      colonic pH, prebiotics can enhance absorption of minerals such as calcium and magnesium and&#xD;
      they have been proposed to potentially improve iron absorption as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of an addition of GOS to an&#xD;
      iron supplement on iron absorption in iron deplete, healthy, normal weight women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is still the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world&#xD;
      according to WHO. It does not only affect large numbers of women and children in the&#xD;
      developing world, but also in industrialized countries. The current estimation is that 2&#xD;
      billion people, or around 30% of the world's population, are anemic, of which around 50% is&#xD;
      caused by iron deficiency. In industrialized countries, ID remains a public health concern in&#xD;
      young women, affecting 16% of females between the ages of 12-49y in the United states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron supplementation has been recommended by the WHO as an approach to improve iron status in&#xD;
      varying age and risk groups. Iron supplementation can be practical for high-risk groups such&#xD;
      as pregnant women and has been proven effective for increasing hemoglobin levels in women.&#xD;
      However, iron absorption from supplements is generally low and epigastric side effects reduce&#xD;
      compliance. With the high global burden of iron deficiency and anemia, improved products&#xD;
      which allow better absorption and reduce side effects are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted iron supplementation in high risk groups is the preferred way to treat iron&#xD;
      deficiency. However, the recommendation is to consume iron supplements away from food in&#xD;
      order to increase bioavailability which often causes nausea and epigastric pain and thus&#xD;
      reduces compliance. Taken together with food, bioavailability of most supplements is reduced&#xD;
      by about two thirds. Thus, a lot of unabsorbed iron passes into the colon where it can&#xD;
      increase the abundance of enteropathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prebiotic fibers, such as galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), selectively enhance growth of&#xD;
      beneficial colonic bacteria. GOS are enzymatically produced from lactose and are a mixture of&#xD;
      glucose- and galactose- based di- and oligosaccharides of varying structure and seem to have&#xD;
      an increased selectivity towards Bifidobacterium spp compared to other prebiotics. Prebiotics&#xD;
      in general enhance the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and thereby decrease&#xD;
      luminal pH, which may reduce growth of enteropathogens. Through the reduction in colonic pH,&#xD;
      prebiotics can enhance absorption of minerals such as calcium and magnesium and they have&#xD;
      been proposed to potentially improve iron absorption, by reducing ferric to ferrous iron in&#xD;
      the colon. Even though colonic absorption is minimal compared to absorption in the duodenum&#xD;
      in healthy humans, it may become more important in iron deficiency or anemia as demonstrated&#xD;
      in animal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of an addition of GOS to an&#xD;
      iron supplement on iron absorption in iron deplete, healthy, normal weight women.&#xD;
