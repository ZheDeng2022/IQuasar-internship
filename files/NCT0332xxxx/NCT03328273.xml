  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of&#xD;
      acalabrutinib and ceralasertib (known as AZD6738) when taken in combination.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the safety of ceralasertib when given as monotherapy&#xD;
      (discontinued) and in combination with acalabrutinib in subjects with R/R CLL and in subjects&#xD;
      who have few therapeutic options available to them. As such, this study includes a formal DLT&#xD;
      assessment of the first 6-12 subjects dosed in Part 1 of the study. In addition, routine and&#xD;
      regular safety monitoring will be undertaken during this study to fully assess safety of&#xD;
      ceralasertib given as monotherapy and in combination with acalabrutinib, with toxicity&#xD;
      assessment and dose reduction guidelines.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of relapsed or refractory CLL that meets published diagnostic criteria&#xD;
             (International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia [IWCLL] Hallek 2008) and&#xD;
             supported/documented by medical records&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be Relapse/Refractory high risk CLL and have exhausted other therapeutic&#xD;
             options according to local/regional standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have received ≥1 prior therapy for treatment of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of ataxia telangiectasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior exposure to an ATR inhibitor or known hypersensitivity to an excipient of&#xD;
             the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A life-threatening illness, medical condition or organ system dysfunction which, in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption or metabolism of ACP-196 (acalabrutinib) and/or Ceralasertib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, or&#xD;
             any Class 3 or 4 cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association&#xD;
             Functional Classification, or corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 480 msec.&#xD;

             inflammatory bowel disease, or partial or complete bowel obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requirement of treatment with proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole, esomeprazole,&#xD;
