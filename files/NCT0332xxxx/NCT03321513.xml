  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both aflibercept and bevacizumab have been shown to improve vision in eyes with DME. In eyes&#xD;
      with DME and at least moderate vision loss, both aflibercept and bevacizumab were also shown&#xD;
      to be successful in many eyes. However, aflibercept was shown to be more effective at&#xD;
      improving vision, on average, at 1 year and at 2 years. Due to the large cost difference&#xD;
      between the two drugs, many clinicians and patients are choosing to initiate treatment with&#xD;
      bevacizumab and then switch to aflibercept depending on the eye's response to bevacizumab&#xD;
      treatment. However, there is no scientific evidence that this treatment strategy is as&#xD;
      effective at improving vision as initiating treatment with aflibercept. Patients and&#xD;
      clinicians do not know if this approach ultimately has deleterious effects on visual acuity.&#xD;
      If starting with aflibercept is not better than starting with bevacizumab and switching to&#xD;
      aflibercept if needed, the potential cost savings to future patients and the health care&#xD;
      system would be substantial. However, if starting with aflibercept is better, then patients,&#xD;
      clinicians, and health care providers can make informed decisions for how to best treat&#xD;
      patients with DME and at least moderate vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives To compare the efficacy of intravitreous aflibercept with intravitreous&#xD;
      bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept if needed in eyes with CI DME and moderate vision loss&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Able and willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             An individual is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present:&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring&#xD;
             dialysis or kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in&#xD;
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular&#xD;
             disease, and glycemic control).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Individuals in poor glycemic control who, within the last four months, initiated&#xD;
                  intensive insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) or plan to do&#xD;
                  so in the next four months should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of randomization that&#xD;
             involved treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval for the&#xD;
             indication being studied at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Note: study participants cannot receive another investigational drug while&#xD;
             participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known allergy to any component of the study drug or any drug used in the injection&#xD;
             prep (including povidone iodine prep).&#xD;

&#xD;
             • If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment,&#xD;
             individual can become eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Systemic anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within four months prior to randomization or&#xD;
             anticipated use during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • These drugs cannot be used during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become&#xD;
             pregnant within the next 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Women who are potential study participants should be questioned about the potential&#xD;
             for pregnancy. Investigator judgment is used to determine when a pregnancy test is&#xD;
             needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Individual is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center to an area not&#xD;
             covered by another clinical center during the next two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study Eye Criteria The study participant must have at least one eye meeting all of the&#xD;
        inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study participants can have two study eyes only if both eyes are eligible at the time of&#xD;
        randomization. For study participants with two eligible eyes, the logistical complexities&#xD;
        of the protocol must be considered for each individual prior to randomizing both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The eligibility criteria for a study eye are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Best corrected Electronic-Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity&#xD;
             letter score &lt; 69 (i.e., 20/50 or worse) and ≥ 24 (i.e., 20/320 or better) within&#xD;
             eight days of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. On clinical exam, definite retinal thickening due to diabetic macular edema involving&#xD;
             the center of the macula.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diabetic macular edema present on optical coherence tomography (OCT) within eight days&#xD;
             of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Zeiss Cirrus central subfield: ≥ 290µm in women or ≥ 305µm in men&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Heidelberg Spectralis central subfield: ≥ 305µm in women or ≥ 320µm in men&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Investigator must verify accuracy of OCT scan by ensuring it is centered and of&#xD;
                  adequate quality&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and individual cooperation sufficient for adequate&#xD;
             fundus photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusions&#xD;
&#xD;
             The following exclusions apply to the study eye only (i.e., they may be present for&#xD;
             the nonstudy eye):&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • An eye should not be considered eligible if: (1) the macular edema is considered to&#xD;
             be related to ocular surgery such as cataract extraction or (2) clinical exam and/or&#xD;
             OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid&#xD;
             or epiretinal membrane) are the primary cause of the macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual&#xD;
             acuity loss would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,&#xD;
             pigment abnormalities, dense subfoveal hard exudates, nonretinal condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of&#xD;
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,&#xD;
             neovascular glaucoma, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be&#xD;
             decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing&#xD;
             acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment for&#xD;
             diabetic macular edema (DME) in the past 12 months or history of any other treatment&#xD;
             for DME at any time in the past four months (such as focal/grid macular&#xD;
             photocoagulation, intravitreous or peribulbar corticosteroids).&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Enrollment will be limited to a maximum of 25% of the planned sample size with any&#xD;
             history of anti-VEGF treatment for DME. Once this number of eyes has been enrolled,&#xD;
             any history of anti-VEGF treatment for DME will be an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of pan-retinal photocoagulation within four months prior to randomization or&#xD;
             anticipated need for pan-retinal photocoagulation in the six months following&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of anti-VEGF treatment for a disease other than DME in the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral&#xD;
             buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior four months or anticipated within&#xD;
             the next six months following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within two months prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Aphakia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Exam evidence of external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis, chalazion, or&#xD;
             significant blepharitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Evidence of uncontrolled glaucoma. • Intraocular pressure must be &lt;30, with no more&#xD;
             than one topical glaucoma medication, and no documented glaucomatous field loss for&#xD;
             the eye to be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note, combination therapies are considered more than one medication&#xD;
