    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of bexarotene in preventing breast&#xD;
      cancer in patients at high risk for breast cancer. Bexarotene belongs to a class of drugs&#xD;
      that are called rexinoids, and it may reduce the incidence of breast tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of topical bexarotene 1% (weight by weight&#xD;
      [w/w]) gel for evaluation in healthy women. (Dose Escalation Group) II. Conduct an&#xD;
      intervention of topical 1% bexarotene gel to an unaffected breast of healthy women at high&#xD;
      risk for breast cancer for 4 weeks at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as determined during&#xD;
      the dose escalation group phase to assess bexarotene concentration in the breast tissue.&#xD;
      (Dose Expansion Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To detect bexarotene concentration in the serum at baseline and at 4 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To detect bexarotene concentration in the breast tissue at 4 weeks of treatment in the&#xD;
      dose escalation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate the effects of topical bexarotene on serum biomarkers, we will determine&#xD;
      the change from baseline in i) lipid biomarkers (total cholesterol, triglycerides, low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein [LDL], high density lipoprotein [HDL]), ii) thyroid function biomarkers&#xD;
      (thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH], T4, T3), iii) calcium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine changes in gene expression associated with retinoid action. (Dose Expansion&#xD;
      Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will apply 10mg bexarotene topically to one breast every other day (QOD) for 4 weeks;&#xD;
      Group 2 will apply 10mg bexarotene topically to one breast every other day (QOD) for 1 week&#xD;
      and then daily for 3 weeks after confirmation that toxicity is at an acceptable range; Group&#xD;
      3 will apply 10mg bexarotene topically to one breast every other day (QOD) for 1 week, then&#xD;
      daily for 1 week, and then 20mg daily for 2 weeks after confirmation that toxicity is at an&#xD;
      acceptable range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
