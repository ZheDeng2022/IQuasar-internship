      To evaluate the effects of mechanical left atrial appendage (LAA) closure for secondary&#xD;
      prevention of stroke in the patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, affecting an&#xD;
      estimated 5 million Chinese. Atrial fibrillation is the primary cardiac abnormality&#xD;
      associated with embolic stroke; among patients with AF, there is an annual stroke rate, about&#xD;
      5 times for the same age population in sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although warfarin therapy is effective at reducing the risk of stroke, chronic&#xD;
      anticoagulation presents problems of safety and acceptability for many patients. Drug and&#xD;
      dietary interactions, frequent blood tests, and compliance issues all contribute to&#xD;
      difficulties with chronic warfarin therapy. New oral anticoagulant compounds with better&#xD;
      therapeutic range and without need for similar monitoring, such as Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban,&#xD;
      Apixaban and Edoxaban,have been studied, but there is no direct comparison with left atrial&#xD;
      appendage closure(LAAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However,the left atrial appendage (LAA) is the major location of thrombi in patients with AF.&#xD;
      In patients with nonrheumatic AF and thrombus in the left atrium, the clot was located in the&#xD;
      LAA in 90%. And the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage System is a novel device designed to&#xD;
      prevent the embolization of thrombi that may form in the LAA. It is hypothesized that it may&#xD;
      prevent ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with AF.The PROTECT-Af and&#xD;
      PREVAIL trails confirmed this device's efficacy and safety, compared with warfarin, for&#xD;
      preventing the combined outcome of stroke,systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death. And&#xD;
      the device has been approved by China's FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is the primary cause of death in China, and recurrence of stroke remains a major&#xD;
      public health issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort study is designed to evaluate the effects of mechanical left atrial appendage&#xD;
      (LAA) closure for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in the patients with nonvalvular&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation in China, compared with medicine approach (Warfarin or NOAC),.&#xD;

    <description>This group will receive WATCHMAN device implantation.Device implantation included concomitant antithrombotic medication to facilitate device endothelialization: warfarin and aspirin for 45 days. To assess for device stability, peridevice leaks, and device-related thrombus, transesophageal echo (TEE) imaging was performed at 45 days, 6 months, and 12 months. When the 45-day TEE revealed minimal residual peridevice flow (jet width â‰¤5 mm) and no device-related thrombus, warfarin will be stopped and replaced by clopidogrel, 75 mg daily, until the 6-month visit, after which only aspirin was continued. If an adequate seal is not obtained or a thrombus is detected, patients continue taking warfarin until an adequate seal is attained or thrombus is resolved before transitioning to aspirin.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Oral anticoagulant therapy</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group will take oral anticoagulant drugs(warfarin or the new oral anticoagulant drugs like Dabigatran ).&#xD;
For patients taking warfarin, international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring wil be performed at least every 2 weeks for 6 months and at least monthly thereafter, targeting an INR between 2 and 3. Follow-up visits occurred twice annually after the first year, with neurological assessments at 12 months and yearly thereafter or whenever a neurological event is suspected.</description>
