  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies how well dendritic cell therapy after cryosurgery in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab works in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with&#xD;
      tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
      Cryosurgery, also known as cryoablation or cryotherapy, kills tumor cells by freezing them.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by&#xD;
      targeting certain cells. Giving dendritic cell therapy after cryosurgery in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab combined with cryoablation&#xD;
      and intratumoral mature dendritic cells (mDCs) in patients with metastatic melanoma that has&#xD;
      failed to respond or has stopped responding to initial therapy with a PD-1 axis-blocking&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety profile of pembrolizumab combined with cryoablation and intratumoral&#xD;
      mDCs in patients with metastatic melanoma that have failed to respond or have stopped&#xD;
      responding to initial therapy with a PD-1 axis-blocking monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine median progression-free survival (PFS) obtained with this approach in this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine median overall survival (OS) obtained with this approach in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To quantitate tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in tumor biopsies prior to and&#xD;
      following cryoablation and intratumoral mDCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure PD-L1 levels in tumor biopsies and blood biopsies prior to and following&#xD;
      cryoablation and to assess whether a change in PD-L1 levels differ among those patients who&#xD;
      met the criteria for clinical benefit (progression-free and on study for at least 6 months)&#xD;
      and those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferation and function after&#xD;
      coculture with frozen tumor before and after intratumoral mDC injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo apheresis over 4 hours on day 1 or course 1. Patients also receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses with pembrolizumab repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Within 36 hours after receiving pembrolizumab, patients undergo cryosurgery over 45&#xD;
      minutes on day 1 or 2 of courses 2 and 3. Patients also receive mature dendritic cells&#xD;
      intratumorally (IT) on day 1 or 2 of courses 2 and 3 after cryosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 5 years&#xD;
