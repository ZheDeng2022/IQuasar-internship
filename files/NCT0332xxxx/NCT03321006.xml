  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the third most common health condition affecting older&#xD;
      adults after heart disease and arthritis and is the fifth leading cause of years lived with&#xD;
      disability worldwide. Many hearing-impaired older adults avoid or withdraw from social&#xD;
      contexts in which background noise will make it difficult to communicate, resulting in social&#xD;
      isolation and reduced communication with family and friends.Social isolation and loneliness&#xD;
      have been linked to numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including dementia,&#xD;
      depression, and mortality, and they may also lead to declining physical activity and the&#xD;
      development of the syndrome of frailty. In this project it is hypothesized that untreated&#xD;
      ARHL represents a distinct route to developing Late-life Depression (LLD) and that&#xD;
      individuals with comorbid ARHL/LLD are unlikely to respond to treatments (i.e.,&#xD;
      antidepressant medication) that do not treat the underlying hearing problem. Initial studies&#xD;
      suggest remediation of hearing loss using hearing aids or cochlear implantation may decrease&#xD;
      depressive symptoms acutely and over the course of 6 to 12 months follow-up. However, the&#xD;
      clinical significance of these findings is obscured by lack of rigorous control groups,&#xD;
      failure to objectively document hearing aid compliance, and enrollment of study populations&#xD;
      lacking syndromal depression or even a threshold symptom score.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will conduct the first clinical trial possessing these design features 40&#xD;
      individuals will be recruited who are aged ≥60 years, diagnosed with a clinically significant&#xD;
      depressive disorder, and have moderate ARHL with impaired speech discrimination.&#xD;
      Comprehensive baseline psychiatric, audiometric, neuropsychological, and functional&#xD;
      assessment will be performed. Participants then will be randomized to receive antidepressant&#xD;
      medication (AD) treatment plus full amplification hearing aids or antidepressant medication&#xD;
      plus low amplification hearing aids over a 12-week prospective trial. Data from this study&#xD;
      could suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for LLD and thereby mitigate its public health&#xD;
      burden, while also contributing to the increased recognition and treatment of ARHL more&#xD;
      generally.&#xD;

    <measure>Hamilton Rating Score for Depression (HRSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is rated by a clinician among 24 dimensions (24-item HRSD) with a score on a 3 or 5 point scale. Maximum score is a 74. 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-16 suggest mild depression, 17-23 moderate depression and scores over 24 are indicative of severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale (range 0-7) that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment: range is from 0 (=normal, not at all ill) to 7 (=extremely ill, among the most extremely ill patients worsening)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Adjustment Scale Self-Report (SAS-SR) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS-SR contains 54 questions that measure instrumental and expressive role performance over the past 2 weeks. Each question is rated on a 5-point scale. The overall adjustment score is obtained by summing the scores of all the items and dividing by the number of items answered.&#xD;
The SAS-R overall score ranges from 0-270, with higher questions indication more impairment.</description>

After 4 weeks if subjects do not meet remission criteria (HRSD≤10), the dose of study medication will be increased to escitalopram 20mg or duloxetine 60mg for the remaining 8 weeks of the study.&#xD;
Audeo B-R 90 hearing aid device (Sham): Hearing aids will be the latest Audeo B-R 90 devices manufactured by Phonak. Low amplification hearing aids will be programmed to a hearing threshold of 10dB across all frequencies</description>
