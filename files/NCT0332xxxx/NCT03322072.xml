    <textblock>
      This is a single arm seamless phase I/II prospective cohort study. Patients with early stage&#xD;
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (T1-T2N0M0) or those with a single pulmonary metastasis of a known&#xD;
      malignancy (either following radical treatment or systemic therapy) will be offered&#xD;
      participation in this study. Participants will have three tumor locator beacons placed with a&#xD;
      flexible bronchoscope in the small bronchial airways in proximity (&lt;3cm) from their lung&#xD;
      tumors. These tumor locator beacons will provide real-time positional data and will allow for&#xD;
      smaller treatment volumes of Stereotactic Ablative Radiosurgery (SABR) and also allow for a&#xD;
      specialized form of treatment delivery known as respiratory gated SABR. This is expected to&#xD;
      result in higher precision radiotheapy delivery with less radiotherapy dose to healthy&#xD;
      tissues which are in close proximity to the lung tumours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a seamless phase I/II prospective, single arm, cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I of the trial will consist of two patients and will serve to conduct quality assurance&#xD;
      assessments and to familiarize thoracic surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical&#xD;
      physicists at CancerCare Manitoba and Health Sciences Center in the use and work flow of the&#xD;
      Health Canada approved endobronchial implanted real-time tumor tracking transponder beacons.&#xD;
      Patients in phase I will undergo standard stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) of a lung&#xD;
      tumor with prior endobronchial transponder beacon placement. For phase I, the transponder&#xD;
      beacons will be used for comparative localization analyses and SABR treatment setup&#xD;
      procedures will be carried out independent of transponder beacon data, however, transponder&#xD;
      data will be collected in order to conduct, post-treatment, in vivo quality assurance&#xD;
      assessments of beacon performance characteristics. Otherwise, the SABR treatment for phase I&#xD;
      will consist of the currently accepted standard internal target volume based and standard&#xD;
      image guided SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II of this trial will consist of 26 patients who will undergo a specialized form of&#xD;
      SABR radiotherapy specifically designed to take full advantage of the real-time tumor&#xD;
      tracking ability of the transponder beacons. Specifically, SABR in phase II will consist of&#xD;
      smaller radiotherapy treatment volumes employing respiratory gating and smaller planning&#xD;
      target volume expansion margins given the superior tumor location telemetry afforded by the&#xD;
      beacons. Comparative dosimetric analyses contrasting the traditional ITV/PTV style treatments&#xD;
      to those with reduced ITV/PTV margins achieved via Calypso guided SABR will be performed.&#xD;
      Patient self-reported quality of life and toxicity assessments will be collected with the&#xD;
      goal of facilitating power and sample size calculations for the design of a larger phase III&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of Calypso guided SABR treatment in the future&#xD;

    <description>The anchored lung tracking beacons are passive electromagnetic transponder beacons which are placed immediately adjacent to a lung tumor using a bronchoscope. Three beacons will be placed in the small airways of the lung adjacent to the target tumor (within 3 cm of the tumor). Each beacon measures 2 mm in diameter and 8 mm in length and consists of a miniature electrical circuit that is encapsulated in a biocompatible glass capsule. Each beacon has an affixed five-legged anchoring system which expands to 5mm diameter once deployed. The Calypso transponder beacon is placed endobronchially using the working channel of a bronchoscope. Navigational bronchoscopy can be used to pre-plan the optimal location for each beacon to be placed within the airways by using a pre-bronchoscopy CT scan.</description>
