      The MYnd Analytics PEER Online strategy utilizes EEG diagnostics to direct patients with&#xD;
      psychiatric illnesses to the best medication treatments. This trial will evaluate patients&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of depression who will either receive (1) PEER Online directed therapy or&#xD;
      (2) conventional treatment without EEG guidance and will compare 6 month clinical and&#xD;
      economic outcomes between these groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mynd Analytics has developed the Psychiatric Electroencephalography Evaluation Registry&#xD;
      (PEER) Online® clinical decision support database that uses a combination of software,&#xD;
      analytics, and clinical outcomes to provide objective, adjunctive medication response&#xD;
      information to physicians treating patients with non-psychotic behavioral disorders. PEER&#xD;
      Online uses a statistical analysis of EEG outputs and other patient information to generate a&#xD;
      report that indicates the statistical likelihood of the patient's responsiveness to classes&#xD;
      of central nervous system (CNS) medications (i.e. antidepressants), groups (i.e. SSRI) and&#xD;
      individual agents (i.e. fluoxetine). A discriminant analysis compares neurophysiologic&#xD;
      abnormalities of the patient to patterns of abnormalities of known responders to CNS drugs in&#xD;
      the company's outcomes database of symptomatic patients. This provides a probability estimate&#xD;
      of the similarity of the patient's profile with the profile of groups of individuals&#xD;
      constituting the normative and clinical (symptomatic) database, which provides the treating&#xD;
      physician guidance to which treatments the patient will most likely respond to, and those&#xD;
      treatments to which the patient is least likely to respond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedurally, PEER Online utilizes standard 21-lead digital electroencephalographic equipment&#xD;
      measuring the patient in a resting (but awake) state. The recording generally takes 30-60&#xD;
      minutes. Patients are classified based upon the 1,142 variables calculated in the recording&#xD;
      (FDA-approved neurometric system) and categorized based on the outcome history in treating&#xD;
      patients with similar neurophysiologic outputs. From these outputs and the correlation to the&#xD;
      outcome database, reports may indicate single or multiple medications based on the nature of&#xD;
      the physiologic abnormality discovered. The entire procedure is rapid, non-invasive, devoid&#xD;
      of radiation or high strength magnetic fields, and results in a report, the PEER Outcome&#xD;
      Report that is provided to clinicians in a format similar to antibiotic sensitivity testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design (summary)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient population will consist of individuals with depression who in the opinion of&#xD;
           their physician require medication management. A score of 10 or more on the PHQ-9&#xD;
           instrument will be required for enrollment. Non-psychotic co-morbid illnesses will be&#xD;
           permitted. Patients must not currently be receiving psychotropic medications (including&#xD;
           stimulants, benzodiazepines, or THC). Patients previously on these medications but off&#xD;
           treatment for &gt;30 days are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The physician will declare whether they wish to treat the depression or refer to a&#xD;
           participating psychiatrist. Individual physicians (prior to enrolling any patients) will&#xD;
           be assigned to either agree to utilize MYnd Analytic directed care or to be part of the&#xD;
           control cohort. This will minimize any physician learning effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient will sign informed consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All patients will undergo a study related EEG and MYnd Analytics will develop a PEER&#xD;
           Online report. The report will be released to the treating physicians in the directed&#xD;
           care group but will not be released to the control physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All patients will complete a disease specific assessment tool (QIDS-SR16) at every&#xD;
           office visit (at a minimum assessments at baseline, 3 months into treatment, and 6&#xD;
           months into treatment). Patients choosing to withdraw from the study or from treatment&#xD;
           will also be offered the assessment at participation endpoint. COTA will score each&#xD;
           patient based on the standardized tools as either improved, stable, or worsened. The&#xD;
           primary endpoint for this study is QIDS-SR16 percent mean change from baseline, with&#xD;
           response being defined as a reduction of &gt;50% from baseline. Physicians may know the&#xD;
           results of these tests and may alter therapy per their usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Medication management will be at the final discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
           Physicians assigned to the MYnd Analytics directed care cohort will be encouraged, but&#xD;
           not required, to follow the PEER Online report. Any change in therapy will be documented&#xD;
           by the physician with reason (lack of efficacy, toxicity, patient preference).&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>QIDS-SR-16 is a 16-question self-report inventory that includes the 9 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria symptom domains: sad mood, concentration, self-outlook, suicidal ideation, involvement, energy/fatigability, sleep disturbance (4 items: initial, middle, late insomnia, and hypersomnia), appetite/weight increased or decrease (4 items), and psychomotor agitation/retardation (2 items). The QIDS-SR-16 total scores range from 0 (least severe) to 27 (most severe). This study will examine the percentage of patients with improvement in depression as assessed by the QIDS-SR-16 at the 6 month treatment visit [repeated measures from all visits - for patients who received the intervention ie. MD followed PEER recommended therapy]. Response will be defined as a &gt;50% reduction in QIDS-SR-16 score from baseline.</description>

    <description>PEER Online is similar to a standard QEEG in that it uses QEEG output variables, but differs from a standard QEEG in that it references the QEEG to a normative and then symptomatic database. By comparing a given patient's QEEG to a database of QEEGs of subjects who have tried and responded to a specific medication, PEER Online can provide useful information regarding the response of neuro-physiologically similar patients to a wide number of medications. PEER Online may thus have the advantage of providing physicians with useful information as to medication outcomes before a medication regime is started. It has also been used to help select the medication that best matches the QEEG brainwave pattern, regardless of &quot;symptom clusters,&quot; currently used for diagnostic nomenclature. Patients will receive anti-depressant therapy guide by the results of the PEER Online algorithm.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of depression who in the judgement of their&#xD;
             physician require medication management may be eligible for enrollment. A score of 10&#xD;
             or more on the PHQ-9 instrument will be required for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Some practices utilize the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 are part of routine screening for&#xD;
             depression. If the tests are performed routinely, they do not need to be repeated for&#xD;
             study eligibility, and may be performed prior to informed consent for this study. If,&#xD;
             however, the PHQ-9 is not routinely performed, informed consent must be performed&#xD;
             prior to administration. Patients with a score below 10 will be considered screen&#xD;
             failures and will not be enrolled or offered the MYnd testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with non-psychotic comorbid conditions may be included.&#xD;
