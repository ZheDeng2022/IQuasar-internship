  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mission of corrections is to provide care, custody, and control for incarcerated&#xD;
      individuals. United State prisons are required by constitutional law to provide adequate care&#xD;
      for growing numbers of older inmates who will likely spend their final days in prison. This&#xD;
      Phase I project focuses on research and development of highly interactive computer-based&#xD;
      learning modules for inmate peer caregivers to promote an integrated systems approach to&#xD;
      enhancing the care of the aged and dying in prisons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The US has the highest incarceration rate in the world-imprisoning 693 people per 100,000.&#xD;
      The older adult segment of the prison population has more than tripled since 1990 and their&#xD;
      health issues are common to free people who are 10-15 years their senior. Inmates over the&#xD;
      age of 55 have a death rate that is 10 times that of prisoners aged 25-34. US prison systems&#xD;
      are facing sharply increased demands in caring for aged and dying inmates. A recent&#xD;
      systematic review revealed that inmate peer caregivers can figure prominently in delivery of&#xD;
      end-of-life (EOL) care in prison. However, the degree of training received by inmate peer&#xD;
      caregivers varies widely. The lack of consistent training, both in content and duration&#xD;
      points to a need for evidence based, current, and readily accessible training for this&#xD;
      abundant human resource for meeting a growing need in US prisons. In response to this need,&#xD;
      this Phase I STTR project, titled E-training of Inmate Peer Caregivers for Enhancing&#xD;
      Geriatric and End-of-Life Care in Prisons, will demonstrate the scientific merit and&#xD;
      feasibility of developing cutting edge, media rich learning modules to train inmate peer&#xD;
      caregivers in geriatric and EOL care. The specific aims of the project are to (1) transform&#xD;
      best practices in inmate peer caregiving into a comprehensive training program that consists&#xD;
      of media-rich and highly interactive computer-based learning modules for providing geriatric&#xD;
      and EOL care to their peers; and (2) conduct in-person usability testing of the media-rich&#xD;
      and highly interactive web-based prototypes with inmates who are currently Mental Health Peer&#xD;
      Support Specialists (i.e., prisoners who are experienced caregivers, but na√Øve to geriatric&#xD;
      and EOL care) to evaluate the user interface, ease of use, and perceived barriers in order to&#xD;
      refine and optimize the product. In collaboration with an advisory board of experts in prison&#xD;
      healthcare, geriatrics, ethics, palliative/hospice care, and oversight of an inmate peer&#xD;
      support program, the investigators plan and develop discussion guides and then conduct focus&#xD;
      groups with three groups of prison stakeholders: inmates who serve as peer caregivers for&#xD;
      aged or dying peers; interdisciplinary staff who care for, or oversee care of aged and dying&#xD;
      inmates; and training and information technology staff. One focus group with each of the&#xD;
      above three constituent groups will be held at a men's and a women's prison. Focus groups&#xD;
      will permit investigators to ensure that the design and technology plans match what is&#xD;
      allowable for inmate training and will allow us to isolate essential geriatric and EOL&#xD;
      content for specification in the development of the comprehensive training program. Finally,&#xD;
      the investigators will create and evaluate prototypes of media rich, interactive&#xD;
      computer-based learning modules for inmates serving as peer caregivers. At the end of Phase&#xD;
      I, the investigators will have a specifications document for the design of modules that: fit&#xD;
      with the technology available in corrections settings; is permissible to be used by inmates;&#xD;
      represents the critical learning needs of inmate peer caregivers for assisting with geriatric&#xD;
      and EOL care; and further develops the collaborative relationships in preparation for&#xD;
      commercialization of the product.&#xD;

    <description>The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a validated tool for assessing the usability and acceptability of technology-based products. It contains 10 questions that are rated on a scale from 1 to 5. &quot;The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100.&quot; A score of 68 is considered &quot;above average.&quot; Anything below a 68 is considered &quot;below average.&quot; The higher the score, the higher the usability of the product.</description>
