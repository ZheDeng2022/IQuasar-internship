  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of daratumumab following a&#xD;
      single subcutaneous (SC) administration in healthy participants and to determine whether&#xD;
      premedication with corticosteroids is required to improve the tolerability of SC&#xD;
      administration of daratumumab in healthy participants.&#xD;
