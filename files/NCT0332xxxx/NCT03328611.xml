  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to develop a database of information regarding the&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of participants who have had a joint replacement. The more&#xD;
      information gathered, the better the investigators will be able to treat future patients who&#xD;
      need a joint replacement. For example the investigators learn what works well to help design&#xD;
      implants and treatment protocols for the future. The investigators publish manuscripts and&#xD;
      present research findings around the world to help other investigators and clinicians learn&#xD;
      what is discovered. Furthermore, implant manufacturers may be able to use this information in&#xD;
      the database to evaluate the success rates of specific joint replacement products.&#xD;

      As part of our growing clinical tracking EMR system the investigators plan to collect&#xD;
      preoperative and postoperative Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS) on all patients with&#xD;
      degenerative hip and knee disease. The investigators will collect PROMS along with implant&#xD;
      device specific revision rates. This will be used for implant surveillance, clinical outcome&#xD;
      tracking, return to work outcome metrics and failure modes and rates of various hip and knee&#xD;
      implants. Information generated during regular hospital and clinic visits will be entered&#xD;
      into the database. For example, x-ray findings done before surgery will be entered into the&#xD;
      database. Surgery information will be entered into the database. The investigators will also&#xD;
      enter demographic information into the database such as name, email, birthdate, gender,&#xD;
      height, and weight. Medical co-morbidities such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and prior&#xD;
      surgeries will also be entered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect this information before surgery, during the operation, and at&#xD;
      annual follow-up visits. The investigators will also contact patients via email with short&#xD;
      outcome score surveys (known as Patient Reported Outcome Measures or PROM's). This will save&#xD;
      many hours of return visits if scores indicate the joint replacements are doing well. Also&#xD;
      this will trigger additional follow-up measures if PROMS scores drop off.&#xD;
