      This study will investigate the relationship between resistance training load and repetitions&#xD;
      on cardiometabolic outcomes. The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine&#xD;
      whether high load or low load resistance exercise training affects arterial stiffness in&#xD;
      overweight or obese men and women. Our secondary objectives are to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      high and low load RT on vascular function, cardiac structure, and markers of insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity. Finally, we are going to preliminarily explore the effects of resistance&#xD;
      training on intestinal bacteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While it has been firmly established that aerobic exercise training is an effective modality&#xD;
      for managing cardiometabolic disease risk, the influence of resistance training (RT) is not&#xD;
      as well characterized. It is well established that RT improves muscular strength, size, cross&#xD;
      sectional area, and bone mineral density. Alterations in muscle fiber type, glycolytic and&#xD;
      oxidative enzyme profile, skeletal muscle proteins, and rates of protein synthesis also occur&#xD;
      in response to RT and are obtained from skeletal muscle biopsies. Data from&#xD;
      quasi-experimental studies suggest that moderate-to-high repetition RT with lower training&#xD;
      loads may positively affect skeletal muscle proteins (Glucose Transporter Type 4 (GLUT4),&#xD;
      Hexokinase 2 (HK2), and Adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) involved in insulin signaling in&#xD;
      non-diabetic, obese men. However, data on high load, low rep RT on these variables is&#xD;
      lacking. Thus, we will collect skeletal muscle biopsies to determine if changes in insulin&#xD;
      signaling skeletal muscle proteins are present in response to both training with both high&#xD;
      and low training loads. There is also a body of evidence suggesting that RT may improve&#xD;
      VO2peak values in individuals with low baseline VO2peak values via a possible increase in&#xD;
      capillary density, however, results are currently mixed. Low VO2peak values in overweight and&#xD;
      obese individuals are positively associated with high risk of cardiovascular and all-cause&#xD;
      mortality. Thus, we will measure VO2peak values to determine if (A) starting previously&#xD;
      untrained obese individuals with RT can also improve VO2peak and (B) potential changes in&#xD;
      VO2peak are load dependent. RT has also been reported to improve insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      central pressure. Additionally, aerobic exercise training may positively influence&#xD;
      alterations in the intestinal microbiome, with no currently available evidence on the effects&#xD;
      of RT, Although RT has been shown to be beneficial for improving arterial stiffness and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, most of the available literature is based on protocols prescribing&#xD;
      moderate-to-high repetitions and thus lower training loads. Thus, the effects of prescribing&#xD;
      higher training loads on the aforementioned variables are not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased arterial stiffness (as characterized by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV)&#xD;
      and augmentation index) is a clinical marker for cardiovascular disease and an independent&#xD;
      risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Increased arterial&#xD;
      stiffness has is positively associated with insulin resistance and type II diabetes. In the&#xD;
      early stages of insulin resistance, peripheral insulin action, which occurs primarily in the&#xD;
      skeletal muscle is impaired. This leads to a compensatory increase in insulin release in&#xD;
      order to maintain glucose homeostasis, thus leading to hypertrophy of the pancreatic β cells.&#xD;
      During the early stages of insulin resistance, fasting glucose levels will remain normal,&#xD;
      with hyperglycemia manifesting in the later stages. Chronic hyperinsulinemia and&#xD;
      hyperglycemia in turn cause increases in the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system as well&#xD;
      expression of the angiotensin type I receptor in vascular tissue, thus stimulating VSMC&#xD;
      proliferation, which leads to an increase in arterial stiffness. Chronic hyperglycemia and/or&#xD;
      type II diabetes can lead to an increase in the production of advanced glycation end products&#xD;
      (AGEs), which are proteins or lipids that become glycated due to exposure to glucose.&#xD;
      Excessive production of AGEs can lead to an increase in collagen cross linking in the&#xD;
      vascular walls, which thus leads to an increase in arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it appears that increases in arterial stiffness occur due to perturbations in pulsatile&#xD;
      shear and flow, which leads to abnormal turnover of scaffolding proteins, specifically&#xD;
      excessive collagen production, and the proliferation of VSMCs, which results in a stiffer&#xD;
      vasculature. This is exacerbated by the insulin resistant and/or hyperglycemic state due to&#xD;
      an increase in local activity of the RAAS and expression of angiotensin I receptor activation&#xD;
      in the vascular wall and an increase in age production, which leads to an increase in VSMCs&#xD;
      and collagen cross-linking, respectively, thus further contributing to the development of a&#xD;
      stiffer vasculature. These structural changes can have deleterious downstream consequences&#xD;
      that include ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current studies on the effects of RT on arterial stiffness have reported mixed results. It&#xD;
      has been suggested that training with higher loads may cause greater increases in stiffness&#xD;
      than training with lower loads due to greater acute elevations in blood pressure that occur&#xD;
      with high load RT. Case control studies have reported that resistance trained young and&#xD;
      middle aged non obese men demonstrated higher levels of arterial stiffness when compared to&#xD;
      their aged-matched counterparts. Alternative cross-sectional studies reported that muscular&#xD;
      strength was inversely related with arterial stiffness. Follow-up randomized control trials&#xD;
      (RCT) investigated changes in arterial stiffness after several months of RT in non-obese,&#xD;
      resistance training naïve adults. Improvements in central pressure, in the absence of changes&#xD;
      in PWV, have been reported in non-diabetic obese adults after 12 weeks of RT but the study&#xD;
      lacked an effective control group. Additionally, improvements in insulin sensitivity in&#xD;
      non-diabetic obese males after 12 weeks of RT but was not a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT). Improvements in endothelial function has also been reported after six months of&#xD;
      progressive RT that included both moderate and high training loads. This is significant&#xD;
      because endothelial dysfunction is a downstream consequence of increased arterial stiffness,&#xD;
      and thus an improvement in endothelial function, as measured by relative flow mediated&#xD;
      dilation (%FMD), in response to RT is a reflects an improvement in vascular function, which&#xD;
      is unlikely to occur in conjunction with an increase in vascular stiffness. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      there are no current published RCTs on the effects of high load RT that have measured both&#xD;
      arterial stiffness and endothelial function. This study will follow up on previous studies by&#xD;
      comparing the effects of two distinct RT protocols (high load vs low load) on arterial&#xD;
      stiffness as, measured by PWV and augmentation index, and endothelial function, as measured&#xD;
      by %FMD, to a nonexercising control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A body of literature exists to suggest that morphological changes of the left ventricle take&#xD;
      place in response to resistance training. Case control studies have reported that elite&#xD;
      resistance trained athletes demonstrate evidence of left ventricular wall thickening. The&#xD;
      increase in left ventricular wall thickness is referred to as concentric hypertrophy, which&#xD;
      occurs in response to a chronic increase in afterload. This occurs in the presence of&#xD;
      increased arterial stiffness, uncontrolled hypertension, and aortic stenosis, all of which&#xD;
      can lead to heart failure (HF). RT induced concentric hypertrophy appears to be a&#xD;
      physiological training adaptation, similar to the eccentric hypertrophy that takes place in&#xD;
      response to aerobic training, and thus does not appear to be deleterious. Furthermore,&#xD;
      current RCTs on the effects of RT on morphological changes of the LV suggest that this&#xD;
      adaptation does not always occur or may occur in response to specific training volumes,&#xD;
      frequencies, intensities, and/or over a longer training duration. Since the main outcome of&#xD;
      this study is arterial stiffness, which is a precursor for concentric hypertrophy of the LV,&#xD;
      we will also measure left ventricular wall thickness to see if A) morphological changes in&#xD;
      the LV take place and B) if LV morphological changes are influenced by training load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it appears that moderate training loads are shown to improve insulin sensitivity in&#xD;
      obese individuals. This is significant because insulin resistance is a precursor to increases&#xD;
      in arterial stiffness. However, the effects of training with higher loads on insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity is a current gap in the literature. It has been previously proposed that high&#xD;
      load RT may reduce arterial compliance and/or lead to concentric hypertrophy of the left&#xD;
      ventricular walls. However, current evidence suggests that both moderate and high training&#xD;
      loads improve endothelial function, without negatively affecting the left ventricular wall.&#xD;
      Since endothelial dysfunction is a negative downstream consequence of an increase in arterial&#xD;
      stiffness, it is unlikely that it would improve in conjunction with an increase in stiffness.&#xD;
      Thus, this study will be the first to measure all of these variables to determine if and how&#xD;
      they are influenced by training load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intestinal human microbiome is a recent target of interest due to its role in metabolic&#xD;
      disease risk. Current evidence reports a link between cardiometabolic diseases and changes in&#xD;
      the intestinal microbiota. The effects of exercise training on changes in the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiome is also currently under investigation. Evidence in rat models currently suggest&#xD;
      that voluntary and controlled aerobic exercise training is associated with favorable changes&#xD;
      in the gut microbiome. However, human studies on the effects of exercise on the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiome are currently lacking. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects and potential differences between&#xD;
      high load and low load RT on arterial stiffness. Based on the above described gaps in the&#xD;
      literature the current study will serve as a follow up RCT to previous studies and will&#xD;
      further explore the link between RT, arterial stiffness, and insulin sensitivity. From an&#xD;
      exploratory stand-point we will examine changes if any in the gut microbiome following&#xD;
      resistance training versus control. The proposed study will serve as a follow up RCT to&#xD;
      investigate the differences between high load and low load RT on markers of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness and insulin sensitivity. This study will also serve as the first RCT to investigate&#xD;
      the long-term effects of RT in the intestinal microbiome. Studies investigating the effects&#xD;
      of high load/low repetition RT on cardiometabolic biomarkers are currently lacking, with the&#xD;
      current body of literature focusing on the effects of moderate and low loads and high&#xD;
      repetitions, with limited data on the effects of high load RT.&#xD;
