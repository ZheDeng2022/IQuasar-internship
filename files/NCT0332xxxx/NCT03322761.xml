      This study seeks to investigate whether early exercise efforts can expand the use of exercise&#xD;
      in Multiple sclerosis (MS), from symptom treatment only, to early supplementary&#xD;
      disease-modifying treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in a randomized and controlled manner, with single blinding.&#xD;
      Participants will be allocated to either a systematic aerobic exercise intervention or an&#xD;
      educational programme on exercise and physical activity. Both interventions will last 1 year,&#xD;
      and involve a 1 year follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that early exercise efforts can modify the disease activity and disability&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease in the central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS), characterized by a complex pathogenesis and heterogeneous symptoms. The&#xD;
      histopathological hallmark of the disease is sclerotic lesions. These inflammatory lesions&#xD;
      manifests as disabling relapses, and the number of relapses in the first few years after&#xD;
      disease onset is associated with progression of disability, with a higher number of relapses&#xD;
      leading to a more rapid progression. In addition, diffuse neurodegeneration seems to occur&#xD;
      early in the disease, and even though it is not always clinically evident it is associated&#xD;
      with disease progression. A reduction in relapse rate and neurodegeneration early in the MS&#xD;
      disease course may slow the progression of disabilities and can possibly reduce overall&#xD;
      disease burden. For the individual person with MS (pwMS) a reduction in overall disease&#xD;
      burden will often improve quality of life, and since MS is a lifelong disease this is of&#xD;
      great interest. Preventing disability in pwMS is also highly relevant in a societal&#xD;
      perspective, as it lowers the large costs associated with increased disability. As a&#xD;
      consequence, the importance of early treatment have been emphasized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of MS have seen great advances in the recent years, resulting in an increasing&#xD;
      number of available disease-modifying treatments (DMT). Despite the fact that the current&#xD;
      DMTs favourable alter a number of clinical outcomes and the course of the disease, it is&#xD;
      still a serious and deteriorating condition with significant disease activity, impaired&#xD;
      neurological functions and thus progression of disabilities. New and supplemental treatment&#xD;
      strategies are therefore still warranted, and exercise have gained attention as a safe and&#xD;
      tolerable rehabilitation strategy. Recently, exercise furthermore have gained substantial&#xD;
      attention, as the first indications of neuroprotective and disease-modifying effects of&#xD;
      exercise has been published. However, despite the focus on early treatment in medical DMTs no&#xD;
      studies have investigated the effects of exercise as a supplemental treatment strategy early&#xD;
      in the disease course of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of early exercise&#xD;
      efforts on disease activity and disability progression. In a sub-group the effects will&#xD;
      furthermore be investigated on brain volume, specific brain regions, and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that early exercise efforts can modify the disease activity and disability&#xD;
      progression, by reducing the relapse rate, the progression of Multiple Sclerosis Functional&#xD;
      Composite (MSFC) and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores. The rate of brain&#xD;
      atrophy and the lesion load, obtained by MRI scans, is also hypothesized to be reduced. This&#xD;
      is expected to be due to an exercise-induced reduction in inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomised and controlled study with randomisation to either an&#xD;
      systematic aerobic exercise intervention or an educational programme on exercise and physical&#xD;
      activity. Both interventions are in addition to standard treatment, and will last 1 year. The&#xD;
      exercise intervention will consist of 2 supervised exercise sessions per week in the complete&#xD;
      duration of the study, while the standard treatment plus exercise education program will&#xD;
      consist of 4 educational sessions on the health benefits associated with exercise and&#xD;
      physical activity held every third month throughout the intervention period. The training in&#xD;
      the exercise group will be aerobic exercise (running, cycling, rowing or on a cross-trainer)&#xD;
      planned by exercise physiologists and performed in a progressive manner. To allow handling of&#xD;
      a large number of participants, who is also geographically spread, the exercise intervention&#xD;
      will be locally anchored, but at the same time supervised by student employees from Section&#xD;
      for Sports Science and controlled by internet- and telephonic communication. In addition to&#xD;
      the two intervention groups, data from The Danish MS registry will serve as population based&#xD;
      standard treatment control data. All groups will be followed up 1 year after cessation of the&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To set the estimated number of participants a two-sample two-sided power calculation has been&#xD;
      conducted. The basis for this calculation is an report from Tallner et al. who have shown a&#xD;
      difference in relapse rate during a two-year period (equal to our 1 year intervention, and 1&#xD;
      year follow-up) of 0.65 relapses between physically active and physically inactive MS&#xD;
      patients (active: 0.95 +/- 0.97 relapses in 2 years ; inactive: 1.60 +/- 1.64 relapses in 2&#xD;
      years). 83 patients with MS should be enrolled in each intervention group (a 20% drop-out&#xD;
      rate has been included). Newly published data on the brain atrophy in percentage of total&#xD;
      brain volume after 24 weeks of resistance training have been the basis for a similar&#xD;
      calculation of the number of participants in the sub-group, from whom MRI-scans and blood&#xD;
      samples will be obtained. 41 participants from each intervention group should form this&#xD;
      sub-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS is a complex disease with heterogenous symptoms, and by combining the disciplines of&#xD;
      exercise physiology, neurology and radiology this study can be the first long-term and&#xD;
      large-scale exercise study to investigate the possible neuroprotective and disease-modifying&#xD;
      effects of exercise when initiated early in the disease course of MS. Consequently, this&#xD;
      project has the potential to change present clinical practice and generate further attention&#xD;
      to exercise, not only as symptom treatment, but also as an supplemental disease-modifying&#xD;
      treatment strategy early in the course of MS.&#xD;
