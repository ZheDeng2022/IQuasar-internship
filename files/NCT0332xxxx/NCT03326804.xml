    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, consecutive series, multicentre, observational study&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical outcome of ceramic-on- ceramic hip resurfacing arthroplasty using&#xD;
      the ceramic, non-porous, non-cemented H1 Hip Resurfacing Arthroplasty. It includes a safety&#xD;
      study followed by an efficacy study. Patients will be followed up for 10-years&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to confirm the safety of the H1 hip resurfacing prosthesis by&#xD;
      demonstrating non-inferiority of the H1 device in terms of survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary is to evaluate superiority of the ceramic-on-ceramic H1 hip resurfacing&#xD;
      prosthesis compared to Metal-on-Metal (MoM) hip resurfacing in terms of absence of metal ion&#xD;
      release.The primary end point is revision for any reason.&#xD;

      Investigation type: Premarket study to receive a CE marking, followed by post-marketing&#xD;
      surveillance follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation design: Multi-centre, prospective, non-randomized, observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to confirm the safety and efficacy of the H1 hip resurfacing&#xD;
      prosthesis by demonstrating non-inferiority of the cumulative percent success in subjects&#xD;
      implanted with the H1 hip resurfacing compared to a literature reference rate of the&#xD;
      Birmingham hip resurfacing (BHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to demonstrate superiority of the ceramic-on-ceramic H1 hip&#xD;
      resurfacing prosthesis with its metal-free articulation compared to MoM hip resurfacing in&#xD;
      the absence of metal ion release. Additional goals are to demonstrate non-inferiority of the&#xD;
      ceramic-on-ceramic H1 hip resurfacing prosthesis compared to hip resurfacing with regard to&#xD;
      patient reported outcome measures, objective clinical and functional outcomes, and&#xD;
      radiological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is revision for any reason&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complication rate (adverse events and revisions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicology (blood metal ion measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT assessment (Implant migration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective clinical and functional outcomes (Harris Hip Score, Gait Analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiological assessment (implant orientation, osseointegration)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most successful surgical interventions.&#xD;
      Replacement of an arthritic hip joint provides significant pain relief and improvement of hip&#xD;
      function and mobility. Patients, even elderly people, are more active, have a better quality&#xD;
      of life, less comorbidities and a longer life expectancy. The World Health Organisation (WHO)&#xD;
      has declared THA the second best intervention, only preceded by cataract surgery, regarding&#xD;
      cost effectiveness and quality of outcome. In patients older than 70 years, the overall&#xD;
      survivorship of THA is more than 90% at 10 years and the best clinical results are obtained&#xD;
      for THA as a treatment for osteoarthritis (OA). In this patient population, THA can thus be&#xD;
      considered a lifelong solution. However, both survivorship and clinical results are much&#xD;
      worse in young and active people. The reasons for this worse outcome are multiple. First of&#xD;
      all, younger people usually have a more active lifestyle regarding work and sports. Secondly,&#xD;
      the hip disorders leading to THA in a younger patient population are more difficult to treat.&#xD;
      Congenital hip dysplasia is frequently associated with gross hip deformities, as may be the&#xD;
      case in secondary traumatic OA. Bone stock may be jeopardised in cases of avascular necrosis&#xD;
      of the femoral head (AVN) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Thirdly, a faster bone metabolism&#xD;
      may play a role, but this remains to be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) was introduced to address the inferior survivorship&#xD;
      and unsatisfactory clinical results with THA in young and active patients. The anatomical&#xD;
      reconstruction of the joint has the potential to provide a better function and higher&#xD;
      activity levels compared to THA. Hip resurfacings are inherently higher performing than total&#xD;
      hip replacements because they preserve the flexibility of native femoral head and neck.&#xD;
      Metal-on-Metal (MoM) hip resurfacings have been shown to be safe and effective in many&#xD;
      patients. These patients have superior clinical function over patients with total hip&#xD;
      replacements, with little or no wear at the bearing surface in comparison to hard on soft&#xD;
      bearings. The two most serious complications following hip surgery are death and infection.&#xD;
      Both of these are substantially rarer after hip resurfacing when compared to patients with a&#xD;
      cemented total hip arthroplasty, which is often presented as the gold standard of hip&#xD;
      replacement. However, patients with poorly positioned hip resurfacing implants, poorly&#xD;
      designed implants and smaller sizes especially in females have reported progressive pain&#xD;
      leading to early revision. This pain is commonly caused by one of two problems: either metal&#xD;
      ion particles generated by excessive wear associated with adverse soft tissue reactions to&#xD;
      metal debris or soft tissue impingement on the hard metal edges of the components. Despite&#xD;
      these two problems, hip registries continue to show superior survivorship of hip resurfacing&#xD;
      using a well-designed device in young and active males when compared to total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher metal ion levels have been found in whole blood, serum and urine of patients with MoM&#xD;
      hip arthroplasties (THA and HRA) compared to preoperative values, and to THA with other&#xD;
      bearing surfaces (metal-on-polyethylene, ceramic-on-polyethylene, ceramic-on-ceramic).&#xD;
      Although MoM hip arthroplasty has been shown to produce less volumetric wear compared to&#xD;
      metal-on-polyethylene, the wear debris consists of more numerous, small, nanometre size&#xD;
      particles, which are ingested by macrophages. Contrary to polyethylene, metal particles and&#xD;
      ions are not chemically inert but may have directly toxic, biological effects and may elicit&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reactions in addition to the macrophage-driven, innate, foreign-body immune&#xD;
      responses to particulate debris of any material. Consequently, concerns have been raised&#xD;
      about the physiological consequences of metal release from MoM hip prostheses into the peri-&#xD;
      prosthetic tissue and systemic circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By exchanging the metal material of the bearing with BIOLOXÂ®delta ceramic, a better wearing&#xD;
      and more inert material, the positive clinical performance aspects of MoM hip resurfacings&#xD;
      are retained, while the main cause of early revision is removed. The anatomic shape of the&#xD;
      contours of the devices may go some way to reducing the pain caused by soft tissue erosion,&#xD;
      Thus, the H1 ceramic-on-ceramic hip resurfacing could be used for wider indications than the&#xD;
      currently restricted group of large men. Patients with smaller head sizes, females and&#xD;
      patients with metal sensitivity may all be candidates, enabling them the option to have a&#xD;
      more conservative operation if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The H1 hip resurfacing design is innovative both in its anatomical shape and in the bearing&#xD;
      couple materials as there is currently no all-ceramic bearing hip resurfacing implant in&#xD;
      clinical use. Ceramic-on-ceramic THA has a proven track record with excellent survivorship&#xD;
      results in the arthroplasty registries as well as low complication rates and good functional&#xD;
      results from large clinical series. The materials have been thoroughly tested regarding&#xD;
      biocompatibility, biomechanical and tribological characteristics, and have been used in over&#xD;
      one million clinical cases over the last 11 years, confirming safety of the material.&#xD;
      However, a mono-block ceramic acetabular component without a metal shell such as the H1 hip&#xD;
      has not yet been used clinically. The concept requires investigation before it can be CE&#xD;
      marked and marketed in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anatomical contoured edge of both the cup and the head reduces the incidence of psoas&#xD;
      impingement. The iliopsoas tendon is stretched over the femoral head when the hip is&#xD;
      extended. In the normal hip, the tendon runs over the front edge of the acetabulum, and&#xD;
      femoral head, which it uses as a fulcrum giving some leverage advantage as the muscle&#xD;
      contracts to lift the leg up when bringing the leg up into the bath or into a high car for&#xD;
      instance. When the femoral head is resurfaced, the tendon has to rub over the hard edge of&#xD;
      the resurfacing device. Until now, femoral resurfacing devices have had a symmetric rim,&#xD;
      which tends to extend beyond the normal limits of a femoral head, particularly in female&#xD;
      hips. This overhang can cause painful abrasion of the tendon. Most acetabular components are&#xD;
      also symmetric in shape, unlike the natural acetabular rim contour, which has a recess where&#xD;
      the tendon runs. The rim of the acetabular shell can also be a cause of tendon irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOLOXÂ®delta is a zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA). Along with alumina (Al) and zirconia&#xD;
      (Zr), this material also contains traces of chromium (Cr), strontium (Sr) and very low&#xD;
      amounts of yttrium (Y). This ceramic has an 11-year history of worldwide use in hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty, with an excellent track record. Ceramic-on-ceramic bearings consist of the&#xD;
      hardest material with the lowest wear rate of all bearing couples used in hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
      The very low volume of inert ceramic nanoparticles and the absence of elevated Cobalt (Co)&#xD;
      and Cr ion levels in the bloodstream virtually abolishes the risk of adverse local tissue&#xD;
      reactions (ALTR), allergic reactions and systemic cobalt toxicity which can complicate some&#xD;
      MoM Hip replacements. BIOLOXÂ®delta contains very small amounts of Cr, but Cr release from the&#xD;
      material remains below the detection limit in the blood. Strontium ions are found in the&#xD;
      blood of control patients without any implant and remain at similar background level in&#xD;
      patients with BIOLOXÂ®delta ceramic implants, Yttrium ions are not detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOLOXÂ®delta is a zirconia-toughened alumina ceramic with increased fracture strengths. The&#xD;
      use of BIOLOXÂ®delta has virtually eliminated the already low fracture risk of the older&#xD;
      ceramic implants. The fracture risk in the arthroplasty registries and as assessed by the&#xD;
      manufacturer CeramTec is now estimated at &lt; 0.001%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides a significantly lower risk of mortality with hip resurfacing compared to conventional&#xD;
      cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA), the use of BIOLOXÂ®delta ceramic on ceramic bearings&#xD;
      further reduces the risk of the most devastating complication associated with THA, i.e.&#xD;
      periprosthetic infection . Because of a significant reduction in biofilm formation and&#xD;
      adherence to ceramic surfaces (69%) compared to metal (92%) and highly cross-linked&#xD;
      polyethylene (HXL PE) (100%), the risk of periprosthetic infection is significantly reduced,&#xD;
      to &lt;0.5% at 10 years compared to &gt;1% with polyethylene bearings including HXL PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uncemented fixation of the H1 hip resurfacing is not novel. The porous ingrowth coating&#xD;
      of plasma sprayed titanium and hydroxyapatite has been applied by a leading implant coating&#xD;
      specialist (Medicoat AG, MÃ¤genwil, Switzerland). Acetabular cups using these coatings are now&#xD;
      standard products with more than 15 years of experience. Several metal-on-metal hip&#xD;
      resurfacing designs for non-cemented use, have successfully been implanted in large series of&#xD;
      patients. Ti ions may be released as part of the bone ingrowth process of the non-cemented&#xD;
      hip of knee prosthesis, but Ti_ions from Titaniumdioxyde (TiO2) coatings or&#xD;
      Titanium-aluminum-vanadium (TiAlV) hip or knee arthroplasty components are not associated&#xD;
      with toxic, teratogenic or carcinogenic reactions.&#xD;
