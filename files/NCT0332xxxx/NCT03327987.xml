  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although time from transplant has been a factor in vaccine response, there is limited data on&#xD;
      immunizations that occur in the first post-transplant year, and there are no data that&#xD;
      suggest influenza vaccination early post-transplant may have any adverse effects on the&#xD;
      graft. It is suggested that early vaccinations may lead to reduced immunogenicity due to&#xD;
      induction immunosuppression. However, not vaccinating patients may leave them vulnerable to&#xD;
      influenza infection for a period of time. This study is designed to look at the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and side effects of the standard of care influenza vaccine in patients between&#xD;
      31 and 365 days post-transplant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus is an important cause of morbidity in the transplant population and can lead&#xD;
      to viral and bacterial pneumonia. Influenza vaccine is effective in the prevention of&#xD;
      influenza infection and is recommended by the Canadian National Advisory Committee on&#xD;
      Immunization (NACI). The annual influenza vaccine is suggested for transplant patients as the&#xD;
      standard of care starting from 3 months post-transplant. Most recent guidelines now suggest&#xD;
      that it is reasonable to get a flu shot starting earlier at 1 month post-transplant.&#xD;
      Anti-rejection drugs are now tapered more quickly and it is possible that antibodies will be&#xD;
      produced against the flu shot as early as 1 month post-transplant. The study hypothesizes&#xD;
      that kidney and liver transplant recipients in the early post-transplant period (31-180 days)&#xD;
      will have similar immunogenicity as those in the late post-transplant period (&gt;180 days).&#xD;
