      CTC-STOP is a multicentre prospective randomised controlled phase III trial for metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine if serial CTC counts can be used as early markers of progression to&#xD;
      direct early discontinuation of docetaxel chemotherapy in patients with mCRPC without&#xD;
      adversely impacting overall survival, when compared with standard approaches to guide&#xD;
      treatment switch decisions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer will be randomised 1:1 to&#xD;
      either control group (standard of care) or intervention group (CTC-guided treatment). All&#xD;
      patients will commence first line chemotherapy with docetaxel three-weekly and will receive a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 cycles of treatment before any recommendation to discontinue first-line&#xD;
      docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Group (standard of care): patients will receive first line docetaxel until&#xD;
           disease progression according to treating clinician or completion of 10 cycles. Patients&#xD;
           and treating clinicians will not be disclosed to the results of CTC determinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention Group (CTC guided treatment): patients will receive first line docetaxel&#xD;
           until progression by CTC, and/or disease progression according to treating clinician or&#xD;
           completion of 10 cycles. CTC results will be available to the treating clinician to&#xD;
           guide decision-making. A progressing CTC count on Day 1 will require confirmation with a&#xD;
           second CTC count performed on Day 15 (-/+ 5 days) of that cycle. If a patient is found&#xD;
           to have two successive CTC determinations showing progression by CTCs, the clinician&#xD;
           will receive a recommendation to discontinue docetaxel on the following cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons of the treating clinician to discontinue docetaxel will be reported in both&#xD;
      groups. Patients who discontinue first line docetaxel according to the criteria for each&#xD;
      group will be switched to second line chemotherapy with cabazitaxel. After progression on&#xD;
      cabazitaxel or completion of 10 cycles, patients will be followed up for survival every three&#xD;
      months until end of study.&#xD;
