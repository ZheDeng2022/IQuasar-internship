  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm phase II study, to determine the overall response rate for&#xD;
      the combination of lenvatinib and pemrolizumab in patients with metastatic gastroesophageal&#xD;
      cancer who have progressed on first or subsequent line therapies. Given the significant cross&#xD;
      talk between angiogenesis and the immune response, combined therapy with lenvatinib and&#xD;
      pemrolizumab in advanced gastroesophageal cancer patient will provide improved outcomes&#xD;
      compared to standard treatment with currently approved agents.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to determine the progression free survival (PFS), overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) and toxicity rates in advanced gastroesophageal patients treated with&#xD;
      lenvatinib and pemrolizumab.&#xD;
