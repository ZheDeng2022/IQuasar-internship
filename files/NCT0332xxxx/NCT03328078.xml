  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label trial to evaluate oral administration of CA-4948 in adult&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. Part A will evaluate escalating&#xD;
      doses of CA-4948 either as monotherapy (Part A1) or in combination with ibrutinib for non-&#xD;
      Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (WM/LPL) and chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) (Part A2). Once the combination&#xD;
      dose has been determined, Part B will comprise an expansion phase to assess efficacy (CR&#xD;
      rate) and safety of the RP2D of CA-4948 and ibrutinib in 4 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)&#xD;
      disease-specific cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 - Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 - activated B-cell (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or extranodal&#xD;
           subtypes: Leg-, testicular-, or not otherwise specified (NOS)-type&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3 - Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4 - Patients receiving ibrutinib monotherapy who have developed adaptive,&#xD;
           secondary resistance. Indications include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), MZL, CLL/SLL, or WM/LPL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Indications for which ibrutinib is National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#xD;
                (NCCN)-listed (e.g., PCNSL)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with NHL and known myddosome mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients may be candidates for maintaining ibrutinib while CA-4948 will be added&#xD;
                for resistance reversal. A brief gap of ibrutinib therapy of &lt;3 weeks is&#xD;
                acceptable.&#xD;
