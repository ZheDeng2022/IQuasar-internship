  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upwards of 40% of cancer patients will develop brain metastases during their illness, most of&#xD;
      which become symptomatic. The burden of brain metastases impacts the quality and length of&#xD;
      survival. Thus the management of brain metastases is a significant health care problem.&#xD;
      Standard treatment options include stereotactic radiosurgery and/or whole brain radiation.&#xD;
      There is a great interest in studying the association between the functional characteristics&#xD;
      of tumors - such as tumour hypoxia and lactate accumulation - and clinical outcomes in order&#xD;
      to guide management. These characteristics may predict future tumor behavior and stratify&#xD;
      risk of therapy failure. Hyperpolarized 13C MR imaging is a novel functional imaging&#xD;
      technique that uses 13C-labeled molecules, such as pyruvate, and MRS to image in vivo tissue&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is significant clinical heterogeneity in patients with brain metastasis due to&#xD;
      differences in underlying tumour biology. Biochemical differences in tumour metabolism have&#xD;
      been shown to correlate with response to therapy. While the significance of tissue hypoxia&#xD;
      for radiosensitivity has been established for years, the impact of lactate accumulation on&#xD;
      radiosensitivity has only recently been recognized. Studies have shown that tissue lactate&#xD;
      levels correlate with radioresistance in several human tumours. Hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate&#xD;
      MRS has been shown in numerous pre-clinical studies and a recent clinical study to have great&#xD;
      potential as a metabolic imaging tool. Our study seeks to establish the role of&#xD;
      hyperpolarized 13C MRS in characterizing the metabolic features of intracranial metastasis.&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide insight into intracranial metastatic disease&#xD;
      signatures with MR spectroscopy and determine if there is added benefit for incorporation of&#xD;
      this new technique into future clinical MRI protocols. If the technique can accurately&#xD;
      differentiate between aggressive and indolent tumours based on MR spectroscopic patterns,&#xD;
      hyperpolarized 13C MRS may have wide-ranging utility in the future. In the era of&#xD;
      personalized medicine, the ability of imaging tests to predict response to therapy would open&#xD;
      the door for individualized treatment options specific to each patient's disease biology.&#xD;

      This is a pilot prospective, single-institution study in both control participants, control&#xD;
      participants with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and participants with&#xD;
      evidence of intracranial metastases who will be planned for brain radiation therapy. Control&#xD;
      participant accrual will be done through advertisements. For control participants with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and intracranial metastatic disease screening and&#xD;
      accrual will be completed by a member of the participant's Circle of Care. Clinical&#xD;
      procedures will be completed at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (SHSC) by the study's&#xD;
      Qualified Investigator or medical designate. Eligible control participants must meet the&#xD;
      study's inclusion and exclusion criteria and MRI eligibility. Intracranial metastatic&#xD;
      participants must meet the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria, MRI eligibility will be&#xD;
      undergoing radiation therapy (stereotactic radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I (Controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Population: up to 106 study participants, ≥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant in Groups A to G and J and K will undergo a single MRI sequence with a&#xD;
           single hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate injection. Participants in group H and I will undergo&#xD;
           MRI sequences with two consecutive injections of hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate. The scans&#xD;
           are expected to be of approximately 60 to 75 minutes in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: up to 6 participants ≥ 18 years of age. Group B: up to 10 male participants between&#xD;
      the age of 18-39 Group C: up to 10 female participants between the age of 18-39 Group D: up&#xD;
      to 10 male participants between the age of 40-59 Group E: up to 10 female participants&#xD;
      between the age of 40-59 Group F: up to 10 male participants ≥ 60 years of age Group G: up to&#xD;
      10 female participants ≥ 60 years of age Group H: up to 10 male or female participants ≥ 18&#xD;
      years of age Group I: up to 10 male or female participants ≥ 18 years of age Group J: up to&#xD;
      10 male or female participants ≥ 60 years of age with Mild Cognitive Impairment Group K: up&#xD;
      to 10 male or female participants ≥ 60 years of age with Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Population: up to 5 study participants from the Odette Cancer Centre, ≥18 years of age&#xD;
           with demonstrated intracranial metastasis on imaging (CT or MRI), who have been referred&#xD;
           to clinic for radiotherapy consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure: Each participant will undergo additional MRI sequences (hyperpolarized 13C&#xD;
           pyruvate MRS) with an additional length of approximately 30-60 minutes that will be&#xD;
           performed on the day of or in advance of the participant's routine radiation planning&#xD;
           scan prior to radiation treatment. No extra visits to the hospital, beyond routine&#xD;
           clinical care, are anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Population: up to 30 study participants from the Odette Cancer Centre, ≥18 years of age&#xD;
           with demonstrated intracranial metastasis on imaging (CT or MRI), who have been referred&#xD;
           to clinic for radiotherapy consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure: Each participant will undergo additional MRI sequences (hyperpolarized 13C&#xD;
           pyruvate MRS) with an additional length of approximately 30-60 minutes that will be&#xD;
           performed on the day of or in advance of the participant's routine radiation planning&#xD;
           scan prior to radiation treatment In addition, each participant will undergo one&#xD;
           non-routine MRI scan with a length of approximately 60-90 minutes at a time point of 1-5&#xD;
           days following radiation treatment.&#xD;
