    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed specifically to determine the short-term effect of OBVAT on&#xD;
      intermittent exotropia in terms of 4 key areas (Standardizing reported outcomes of surgery&#xD;
      for intermittent exotropia): control score, alignment, near stereoacuity and quality of life&#xD;
      score. Result of this pilot study will be used to determine whether a full-scale RCT should&#xD;
      be conducted to evaluate the short and long term effectiveness of OBVAT.&#xD;

          1. 8 to 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. deviation meeting all of the following criteria: A. intermittent or constant exotropia&#xD;
             at distance (mean of 3 baseline assessments of distance control&gt; or = Grade 2) B.&#xD;
             intermittent exotropia at near (at least 1 of 3 assessments of near control at the&#xD;
             baseline visit Grade 2-4) C. distance and near exodeviation both between 15 to 35&#xD;
             prism diopters (PD) measured by prism and alternate cover test (PACT); D. near&#xD;
             deviation not exceeding the distance deviation by &gt;10PD by PACT (i.e., convergence&#xD;
             insufficiency type IXT excluded)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. cycloplegic objective refraction spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error between&#xD;
             -6.00 diopters (D)and +1.00 D inclusive in either eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be wearing the updated refractive correction (spectacles or contact&#xD;
             lenses) for at least 1 week if refractive error (based on cycloplegic refraction&#xD;
             performed within 6 months) meets any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A. Myopia &gt;-0.50 D spherical equivalent in either eye B. Anisometropia &gt;1.00 D&#xD;

             exotropia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Regular use of any ocular or systemic medications known to affect accommodation or&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Relocation anticipated for 2 years；&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Significant ocular or neurologic disorders (e.g. cerebral palsy) other than strabismus&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Vertical deviation greater than 1 pd in cover test&#xD;
