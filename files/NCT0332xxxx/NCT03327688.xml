      This study has two aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a common suspected medical condition. If it cannot be&#xD;
           excluded clinically and using D-dimer, ultrasound examination is required. An option for&#xD;
           traditional radiologist-performed ultrasound is a 2-point compression ultrasound&#xD;
           (2-CUS). The safety of this technique is proven. However there does not exist any data&#xD;
           on costs comparing traditional and 2-CUS pathways in primary health care. This study&#xD;
           will evaluate the total cost of both pathways by conducting a cost-minimization&#xD;
           analysis. It will also study the effect of a simple ultrasound education on the&#xD;
           referrals to hospital due to suspected DVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1: Short education in ultrasound will reduce significantly referrals to&#xD;
           hospital and save resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Length of stay (LOS) in emergency department (ED) is related to increased mortality,&#xD;
           morbidity, prolonged hospital stay and probably patient satisfaction. LOS of patients&#xD;
           with a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) performed by an emergency physician (EP) will be&#xD;
           compared to those that have a radiology performed ultrasound examination. Further&#xD;
           examination and accuracy of POCUS will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: POCUS can shorten LOS significantly in selected clinical conditions&#xD;

      This study has two aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Deep venous thrombosis is a common suspected medical condition. If it cannot be excluded&#xD;
           clinically and using D-dimer, ultrasound examination is required. An option for&#xD;
           traditional radiologist-performed ultrasound is a 2-point compression ultrasound&#xD;
           (2-CUS). The safety of this technique is proven. However there does not exist any data&#xD;

           will evaluate the total cost of both pathways by conducting a cost-minimization&#xD;
           analysis. It will also study the effect of a simple ultrasound education on the&#xD;
           referrals to hospital due to suspected DVT. T&#xD;
&#xD;
           he study is performed in Saarikka Primary Care Public Utility, Saarij√§rvi, Finland.&#xD;
           There are 15 general practitioners (GP) working. During year 2014, 2 of them were&#xD;
           performing 2-CUS. 9 of the other GPs were trained during years 2015-2016 to perform a&#xD;
           2-CUS and hence 11 of 15 GPs are able to do 2-CUS in 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a register study. Referrals to hospital in 2014 (pre-training) and 2017&#xD;
           (post-training) are examined and the difference is assumed to be because of training and&#xD;
           new pathway. Based on population the expected number of referrals due to a suspected DVT&#xD;
           should be approximately 100 annually and the expected number after intervention is 30.&#xD;
           According to power analysis a reduction from 100 to 76 is statistically significant&#xD;
           (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1: Short education in ultrasound will reduce significantly referrals to&#xD;
           hospital and save resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Length of stay (LOS) in emergency department (ED) is related to increased mortality,&#xD;
           morbidity, prolonged hospital stay and probably patient satisfaction. LOS of patients&#xD;
           with a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) performed by an emergency physician (EP) will be&#xD;
           compared to those that have a radiology performed ultrasound examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part started in Central Finland Central Hospital and Kuopio University Hospital 10/2017.&#xD;
      Tampere university hospital will start at 5/2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An average LOS in Central Finland Central hospital ED is approximately 150 minutes. In a&#xD;
      randomly selected monday in January, 2017, the average time from a referral to radiologist to&#xD;
      a finished radiologist statement was 86 minutes. The times in Kuopio university hospital are&#xD;
      much longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When an EP decides to perform a POCUS exam, they will recruit the patient in the study and&#xD;
      fill a simple structured form. It is up to the EP treating the patient to decide if the&#xD;
      patients needs POCUS. No additional examination because of this study is made on the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed time stamps for the patient to register in the ED, first doctor visit and&#xD;
      finished from the doctor are retrieved from the files. In a follow-up of 6 months it is noted&#xD;
      if the patient had a further examination by radiologist and if it was an ultrasound, CT, or&#xD;
      some other examination. The results from POCUS will be compared to the radiologist&#xD;
      examination, surgery or autopsy results where available and appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group is found from picture archive system (PACS) system with going through&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations on the same days as POCUS examinations are made, with a referral&#xD;
      question that a POCUS could answer, and referring unit being emergency department, and the&#xD;
      same time points will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There exists plenty of research on a focused ultrasound examination performed mostly by&#xD;
      emergency physicians. In certain clinical questions such as abdominal aorta aneurysm or&#xD;
      gallbladder stones, the accuracy of POCUS is excellent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There also exists some research on POCUS effect on LOS compared to a standard ultrasound&#xD;
      examination performed mostly by a radiologist. The reduction in LOS has been huge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no data on regarding the Finnish health care system in this field. Also this study&#xD;
      aims to evaluate multiple POCUS indications in a single real life setting which is not&#xD;
      published before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: POCUS can shorten LOS significantly in selected clinical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance plan: non-existent Data checks: non-existent Source data verification: EP&#xD;
      filling the research form fills in only the finding in POCUS. It cannot reliably be verified&#xD;
      in any way. All other data comes from medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data dictionary: Non-existent for now Standard operation procedures: Non-existent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assesment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: a whole year prior and after intervention is evaluated. According to power analysis,&#xD;
      change from 100 to 76 would be statistically significant. A reduction of 100 to 30 is&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: According to expected LOS reduction of at least 86 minutes, the study should need&#xD;
      only approximately 10 patients + control group to show statistical significance. However a&#xD;
      group of 400 patients will be recruited. The purpose of this is to be able to perform quality&#xD;
      sub-group analysis based on indication of POCUS but also the experience level of EP&#xD;
      performing the POCUS examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data: The study form in part 2 is the only reliable source for the POCUS&#xD;
      results and if this is missing, the patient must be excluded. All other data is derived from&#xD;
      the medical files statistics and should reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: A cost-minimization analysis will be performed in part 1. Other&#xD;
      statistical analysis methods will be decided later.&#xD;
