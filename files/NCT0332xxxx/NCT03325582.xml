  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perianal Crohn's disease (pCD) is the commonest form of fistulising Crohn's disease, with up&#xD;
      to 38% of patients affected and with 30% of them experiencing recurring disease symptoms.&#xD;
      Presence of fistula can lead to major morbidity due to cutaneous perianal abscess formation&#xD;
      or drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, it is very difficult to quantify inflammation in patients with pCD due to the&#xD;
      absence of reliable disease activity measurements. In addition to this, optimising therapies&#xD;
      for pCD is quite challenging and may have a major impact on quality of life. Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging of pelvic is a standard examination for the anatomical evaluation of pCD&#xD;
      which is significant in terms of surgical therapy and progress. The overall hypothesis is&#xD;
      that newer MRI techniques such as magnetization transfer (MT), diffusion weighted image (&#xD;
      DWI) and dynamic contract enhancement (DCE) are better suited to measuring the inflammatory&#xD;
      vs fibrotic burden in pCD. The aim of this project is to measure disease activity within pCD&#xD;
      and luminal CD using MRI sequences before and after biological therapy&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease has the United Kingdom prevalence of ~620,000 patients. PCD is the&#xD;
      commonest form of fistulising Crohn's disease with 20% of patients affected and with 30% of&#xD;
      them experiencing recurring disease symptoms. Durable clinical remission rate for complex&#xD;
      fistulas is only 37% at the end of a 10-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this date, it is very difficult to reliably measure disease activity within the fistulas&#xD;
      in pCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are sometimes needlessly left on long term medical therapy when their pCD has&#xD;
      reached a chronic, fibrotic and irreversible stage. This practice needlessly exposes patients&#xD;
      to clinical risk and health care systems to the financial expense of up to&#xD;
      ~£20k/patient/year. More commonly, medical therapies are stopped prematurely, leading to&#xD;
      prompt disease recurrence and chronic fistulisation with a major impact on quality of life.&#xD;
      Importantly, it is very difficult to optimise therapies for pCD due to the absence of&#xD;
      reliable disease measures. It is not possible to reliably correlate therapeutic drug&#xD;
      monitoring to disease activity states. Due to all these limitations there has been an&#xD;
      alarming paucity of well-designed randomised clinical trials. To this effect, both the 5th&#xD;
      Scientific Workshop on pCD of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the global&#xD;
      consensus on the classification, diagnosis and treatment of pCD by the international&#xD;
      Organisation of Inflammatory Bowel disease, have highlighted the urgent need of more&#xD;
      sensitive and specific MR-markers of disease activity in pCD. Once reliable MR measures of&#xD;
      disease activity have been validated then these can be used to design appropriate,&#xD;
      inexpensive, sensitive and non-invasive MR based clinical activity scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various clinical and radiological outcome measures have been investigated to quantify pCD&#xD;
      activity. Clinical assessment is crude and participant to inter-operator-variability, with&#xD;
      response loosely defined as a reduction of ≥50% in the number of draining fistulas and&#xD;
      remission the absence of draining fistulas on two consecutive visits. This assessment has&#xD;
      never been validated, and takes no account of the inflammatory state of the disease deep&#xD;
      within the perineum. A Perineal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) was developed to assess&#xD;
      perianal disease severity and response to therapy. It is based on the assessment of quality&#xD;
      of life and disease severity. The PDAI score is 87% accurate and wrongly classifies patients'&#xD;
      disease activity in 10% of cases, but is insensitive to change after medical therapy and its&#xD;
      remission cut-off never been properly determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard imaging modality for pCD is pelvic MRI. A recent meta-analysis indicated a&#xD;
      sensitivity of MRI for fistula detection of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.63-0.96) but a low specificity of&#xD;
      0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51-0.82).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A T2-weighted MR sequence with fat-suppression sequences is the current advised technique for&#xD;
      MR fistula imaging. This forms the basis of the Van Assche 1 score. This MR-based score was&#xD;
      suggested to provide combined information of anatomical fistula description and features&#xD;
      reflecting inflammatory activity. The score is insensitive to clinical response, with no&#xD;
      significant difference shown in clinical responders to anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF)&#xD;
      therapy before and 6 weeks after treatment, nor was there a difference in the score between&#xD;
      clinical responders and non-responders. Longer term studies replicated these findings and&#xD;
      also showed a dis-concordance of at least 12 months between clinical and radiological&#xD;
      remission. T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced images did not change significantly before or&#xD;
      after treatment . No correlation was found between these MR-based measures of fistula&#xD;
      activity and other known markers of disease activity like C-reactive protein and the PDAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of published studies have been carried out at 1.5T. The 3T scanners available at&#xD;
      the Universities of Nottingham,London and Manchester will provide better resolution and&#xD;
      sensitivity allowing us to design better clinical protocols incorporating quantitative MRI.&#xD;
      3T MR scanners are available in National Health Service(NHS) trusts but are not routinely&#xD;
      used for the assessment of pCD. Our aim is to develop an optimized protocol for 3T imaging&#xD;
      although we expect that our results will also be able to improve 1.5T imaging. This work will&#xD;
      create a paradigm shift in the radiological monitoring of disease activity in pCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent work has highlighted the use of magnetisation transfer (MT) MRI techniques7 in&#xD;
      quantifying inflammation and differentiating this from fibrosis. MT generates contrast that&#xD;
      is determined by the fraction of large macromolecules and the immobilised phospholipid cell&#xD;
      membranes in tissues. Particularly when combined with T2 measurements, MT may be helpful in&#xD;
      differentiating and quantifying inflammation by the relative absence of collagen, and&#xD;
      differentiating inflamed perianal fistulas that need treatment from other chronic fibrotic&#xD;
      and irreversible fistulas that would not be responsive to treatment - better selecting&#xD;
      patients for expensive medical or surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCE has shown marked enhancement in patients who later develop perianal abscesses needing&#xD;
      surgical treatment or needed medical escalation of therapy. Changes to the timing of how the&#xD;
      tissue takes up the contrast agent may also provide information on whether the tissue is&#xD;
      still actively inflamed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early pilot data on fistula volumetrics and diffusion-weighted MRI in luminal Crohn's disease&#xD;
      have shown good correlation to disease activity both in pCD and in luminal disease. In&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted MRI, the source of the contrast is the movement of the increased number of&#xD;
      water molecules found in inflamed, oedematous tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We suggest that new MR techniques will make it possible to more accurately quantify the&#xD;
      inflammatory burden within pCD. This will allow for better patient follow-up and more&#xD;
      effective clinical decision making. Better medical management with more timely therapy onset,&#xD;
      optimisation and cessation of therapy is needed. Moreover, although early data on therapeutic&#xD;
      drug monitoring is emerging in luminal Crohn's disease, similar data is lacking in pCD due to&#xD;
      the lack of appropriate measures of disease activity. Improving MR methodology, by employing&#xD;
      quantitative MRI to separate inflammation from fibrotic tissues, and to determine fistula&#xD;
      size better will allow for the design and validation of a sensitive clinical scoring system.&#xD;
      We will use the improved sensitivity of 3T to develop optimal imaging approaches and then use&#xD;
      these results to tailor a convenient clinical score. We will determine whether this score can&#xD;
      be used at both 3T and 1.5T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis is that newer MRI techniques such as MT, DWI and DCE are better suited&#xD;
      to measuring the inflammatory vs fibrotic burden in pCD The aim of this project is to measure&#xD;
      disease activity within pCD and luminal CD using MRI sequences before and after biological&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients This multicentre prospective cohort study will be conducted at three sites in&#xD;
      Nottingham (Nottingham University Hospitals), London (Northwick Park NHS Foundation Trust)&#xD;
      and Manchester (Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust). A total of 25 patients (age 16-75 years)&#xD;
      with pCD as deemed by a PDAI of &gt; 4 and a clinician assessment, prior to the onset of&#xD;
      biological therapy. All eligible patients will receive infliximab or adalimumab or&#xD;
      Ustekinumab. Patients will have infliximab 5 mg/kg i.v. at weeks 0, 2, 6 and 8 weekly&#xD;
      thereafter, or Adalimumab subcutaneously (s.c.) at week 0 (160 mg), 2 (80mg), 40 mg every 2&#xD;
      weeks thereafter or Ustekinumab 6mg/kg i.v. at week 0 and a weight-based s.c. every 12 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter. Patients will be excluded from the study if they are due to have surgery in the&#xD;
      near future (12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited participants will have no more than three visits. Visit 1: This will include&#xD;
      screening to ensure participants meet the inclusion criteria and possess none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. The MRI evaluation (visit 2) at 1.5 and then 3T will be performed for all&#xD;
      those recruited before starting biological therapy at week 0. The second MRI scanning session&#xD;
      will be 12 weeks after biological therapies onset (visit 3). The period between scanning&#xD;
      (MRI) (visit 2) and biological therapy onset will be a maximum of 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR Imaging Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be placed in a supine position (feet first) for scanning at both 1.5T and 3T,&#xD;
      with the pelvis centred within a torso phased-array surface coil unless this position proves&#xD;
      too uncomfortable.The MRI scanning will be undertaken on 1.5 Tesla (2 Philips and 1 GE) and&#xD;
      3T (Philips) scanners at the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre at the University of&#xD;
      Nottingham, the Clinical Sciences Building at the Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust ,&#xD;
      Northwick park NHS trust (1.5T) and University College London (UCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All data will be assumed to be non-parametric (due to the small sample&#xD;
      size). Data will be presented as median +/- interquartile range with all comparisons of&#xD;
      single and multiple categorical and continuous matched and non-matched variables done&#xD;
      accordingly. Correlation between the clinical and MR endpoints will be carried out with a&#xD;
      Spearman test. A univariate analysis will be undertaken of the MR endpoints at 12 weeks for&#xD;
      responders and non-responders. For all candidate parameters, κ reliability values based on X2&#xD;
      probability testing will be calculated. We aim to undertake a multiple regression model in&#xD;
      order to create the best-fit weighted scoring system. Double-weighting will be applied for&#xD;
      inflammatory scores versus anatomical scores. However, this may not be possible at this&#xD;
      present stage but this work will provide the pilot data to properly power a downstream study.&#xD;
      P values of less than 0.05 will be deemed significant. All analyses will be carried out with&#xD;
      GraphPad Prism.&#xD;
