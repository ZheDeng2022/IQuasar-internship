  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T- cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy) has an&#xD;
      increase in proteins in a specific pathway called the mTOR pathway within the cancer cells.&#xD;
      In cancer cells it can encourage untimely cell growth, cell production, and cell survival.&#xD;
      Everolimus is an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway and can decrease the growth and survival of&#xD;
      cancer cells. It also prevents communication within cells and stops proteins from being made&#xD;
      that may contribute to leukemia. The main purpose of the study is to find the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose of everolimus when used together with standard chemotherapy.&#xD;

      that may contribute to leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two to six participants will receive the starting dose of everolimus. If the side effects are&#xD;
      not too severe, the next group of participants will take the study drug at a higher dose&#xD;
      level. Up to two dose levels of the study drug will be tested. The main purpose of the study&#xD;
      is to find the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus when used together with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Everolimus has been found to be safe and effective in adults and children for&#xD;
      treatment of T- and B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Corticosteroids: Patients receiving corticosteroids who have not been on a stable&#xD;
                  or decreasing dose of corticosteroid for at least 7 days prior to enrollment are&#xD;
                  not eligible. Corticosteroids must be held for 24 hours prior to initiation of&#xD;
                  study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Investigational Drugs: Patients who are currently receiving another&#xD;
                  investigational drug are not eligible. The definition of &quot;investigational&quot; for&#xD;
                  use in this protocol means any drug that is not licensed by the FDA&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anti-cancer agents: Patients who are currently receiving or may receive while on&#xD;
                  therapy, other anti-cancer agents, radiation therapy or immunotherapy are not&#xD;
                  eligible [except leukemia patients who relapsed on Maintenance therapy or&#xD;
                  patients receiving hydroxyurea, which may be continued until 24 hours prior to&#xD;
                  start of protocol therapy]. Intrathecal therapy may be given up to one week prior&#xD;
                  to initiation of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anti-GVHD or agents to prevent organ rejection post-transplant: Patients who are&#xD;
                  receiving cyclosporine, tacrolimus or other agents to prevent either&#xD;
                  graft-versus-host disease post bone marrow transplant or organ rejection&#xD;
                  post-transplant are not eligible for this trial. At least 3 half-lives must have&#xD;
                  elapsed after the last dose of GVHD meds.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: Patients who are currently&#xD;
                  receiving ACE inhibitors are not eligible due to the development of angioneurotic&#xD;
                  edema-type reactions in some subjects who received concurrent treatment with&#xD;
                  everolimus + ACE inhibitors. At least 3 half-lives must have elapsed after the&#xD;
                  last dose of ACE inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anti-convulsants: Patients who are currently receiving CYP3A4/PgP enzyme inducing&#xD;
                  anticonvulsants (eg. phenytoin, phenobarbitol, or carbamazepine) are not&#xD;
                  eligible. Stabilizing on a non-hepatic inducing metabolizing anti-convulsant (ie:&#xD;
                  gabapentin or levetiracetam) prior to study entry is acceptable. At least 3&#xD;
                  half-lives must have elapsed after the last dose of enzyme inducing&#xD;
                  anti-convulsants.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inhibitors of everolimus metabolism: Patients receiving treatment with azoles&#xD;
                  such as fluconazole or voriconazole which are potent inhibitors of everolimus&#xD;
                  metabolism. At least 3 half-lives must have elapsed after the last dose of&#xD;
                  azoles.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2.5 Patients with significant concurrent disease, illness, psychiatric disorder or&#xD;
             social issue that would compromise patient safety or compliance with protocol&#xD;
             treatment or required observations, interfere with consent, study participation,&#xD;
             follow up, or interpretation of study results.&#xD;
