    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to assess the safety and tolerability of study drugs,&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate (Lutathera) and nivolumab in subjects with small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      or advanced or inoperable neuroendocrine tumor of the lung that has overexpressed&#xD;
      somatostatin receptors (SSRT). Lutathera is an investigational radioactive agent that targets&#xD;
      tumor cells that express SSRT. Nivolumab is an investigational agent that targets and&#xD;
      inhibits a pathway that prevents your immune system from effectively fighting your cancer.&#xD;
      The combination of these 2 study drugs is investigational. The term &quot;Investigational&quot; in this&#xD;
      context means that the drugs have not been approved for clinical use by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Giving Lutathera and nivolumab together may increase the effectiveness of this therapy. We&#xD;
      first need to find out the highest dose of Lutathera that can be given safely together with&#xD;
      nivolumab. This study will be the first study to test giving Lutathera together with&#xD;
      nivolumab. Once we have found the highest dose of Lutathera that can be given with nivolumab,&#xD;
      we will treat more patients with this combination to determine how effective it is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find the highest doses of Lutathera that can be given with nivolumab without causing&#xD;
      severe side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out the side effects seen by giving Lutathera at different dose levels with&#xD;
      nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the amount of something in your tumor called PD-L1 makes you more likely to&#xD;
      have a response to the combination of Lutathera and nivolumab.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project to see if the combination of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate and&#xD;
      nivolumab is safe and tolerable, and provides PFS benefit compared to observation alone in&#xD;
      the maintenance setting in patients with ES-SCLC and no disease progression after first-line&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. A standard dose-escalation phase I&#xD;
      design will be used. Three subjects will be enrolled at each dose level in the absence of&#xD;
      DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of the starting dose of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate and nivolumab is based on the&#xD;
      results from previous clinical studies with each compound used as single agent and the fact&#xD;
      that the combination has not been tested in clinical trials. The first dose of&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate will be given two weeks after the first administration of&#xD;
      nivolumab. Studies have shown that intravenous administration of amino acids has a renal&#xD;
      protective effect [46]. An infusion of amino acids (lysine 2.5% and arginine 2.5% in 1 L 0.9%&#xD;
      NaCl; 250 mL/h) will be started 30 minutes before the administration of&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate and last 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab will be administered as a fixed dose of 240 mg as an intravenous infusion over 30&#xD;
      minutes every 2 weeks. Nivolumab will be given until progressive disease, patient withdrawal&#xD;
      or toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II portion will consist of patients with ES-SCLC who completed platinum based&#xD;
      standard first-line chemotherapy (e.g. 4-6 cycles of platinum plus etoposide or irinotecan)&#xD;
      without disease progression (responders plus stable disease) at the time of initiation of the&#xD;
      combination therapy with 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate and nivolumab. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      then be randomly allocated in two arms: one will be treated with the combination of&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate and nivolumab, and the other arm will continue be followed&#xD;
      (observation) after completion the standard chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not receive radiotherapy after chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The randomization must occur within 6 weeks of the last chemotherapy cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study treatment must start within 2 weeks from randomization. Patients who receive&#xD;
           radiotherapy (including prophylactic cranial radiation and/or thoracic radiation) after&#xD;
           chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The randomization must occur within 9 weeks of the last chemotherapy cycle but at least&#xD;
           2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first dose of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate cannot be given within 8 weeks of&#xD;
           radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization will be stratified according to NETSPOT® PET tumor uptake score (Grade 2,&#xD;
           3 and 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OnCore will be used as statistical center and the randomization algorithm will be&#xD;
           developed by the study biostatistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The project management department will be the first point of contact for assessment&#xD;
           through email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Courses are defined as 56 days of dosing. Nivolumab will be given until progressive disease,&#xD;
      patient withdrawal, or toxicities. For patients randomized to the observation group,&#xD;
      cross-over at the time of disease progression will be allowed, since the primary endpoint is&#xD;
      PFS and not OS.&#xD;

    <description>177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate will be administered every 8 weeks. The first dose of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate will be given two weeks after the first administration of nivolumab. Each dose is infused over 30 minutes. On the day of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate infusion, an intravenous bolus of anti-emetics will be given (suggested options: ondansetron (8 mg), granisetron (3 mg), or tropisetron (5 mg)). Administration of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate may be given one day earlier or delayed up to 1 week due to holidays, inclement weather, conflicts, or similar reasons.&#xD;
Concurrent amino acids are given with each dose of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate since co-infusion of amino acids leads to a significant reduction (47%) in the mean radiation dose to the kidneys. The amino acid solution and 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate are administered in parallel by peripheral vein infusion</description>
