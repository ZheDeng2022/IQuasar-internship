  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventionally fractionated radiation therapy given over 6-7 weeks alone, sequentially, or&#xD;
      concurrent with chemotherapy have produced poor outcomes in Stage II NSCLC in most series.&#xD;
      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has been shown to be very effective and is now&#xD;
      standard of care for Stage 1 disease. There has been initially reluctance to utilize SABR for&#xD;
      central lung tumors because of published reports that showed an excess of toxicity when SABR&#xD;
      was utilized; however, newer data with less intense treatment regimens suggest safety in&#xD;
      treatment of central lung disease. The safety and efficacy of SABR in treating hilar nodes or&#xD;
      N1 disease currently is not known fully and will be evaluated in this study.&#xD;

      1. Primary Objectives Safety run-in - To determine the safety of SABR for the treatment of&#xD;
           primary lung disease and N1 (hilar) node in stage T1-2a N1 NSCLC Phase II - To determine&#xD;
           2-year local control of SABR for T1-2a N1 NSCLC with sequential chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objectives Phase II - To determine overall and progression-free survival&#xD;
           times, pattern of failures, and rates of ≥ grade 3 adverse events after SABR for T1-2a&#xD;
           N1 NSCLC combined with sequential chemotherapy&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase II single-institution trial with a 3 + 3 safety run-in period. SABR will be delivered per protocol, followed by a planned 4 cycles of sequential chemotherapy within 3-8 weeks after the completion of SABR. Four cycles of chemotherapy shall be planned as typically used for adjuvant chemotherapy following surgical resection for T1-2aN1 non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) unless otherwise indicated by institutional guidelines.</intervention_model_description>
