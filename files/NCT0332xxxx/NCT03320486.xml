  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate that dapaconazole cream 2% (experimental&#xD;
      drug) is non-inferior to ketoconazole cream 2% (Nizoral® - active comparator) for the&#xD;
      treatment of dermatological lesions of Tinea pedis, when applied to the skin (topically) once&#xD;
      daily during 28 days. Additionally, the safety and tolerability aspects will be evaluated in&#xD;
      a descriptive way, through the observation of the incidence of adverse events.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized (allocation of&#xD;
      treatment), balanced, controlled (active comparator) trial, with two parallel groups in a 1:1&#xD;
      proportion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will depend on inclusion/exclusion criteria, taking into account the&#xD;
      confirmation of diagnosis by the direct mycological test performed during the screening&#xD;
      phase. However, cases whose diagnosis is not additionally confirmed by positive fungal&#xD;
      culture (sampled during the screening phase) will be excluded from the efficacy analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will show up to the clinic, for treatment, during 42 consecutive days, when one&#xD;
      of the investigational products (according to the randomization) will be applied by a blind&#xD;
      member of the study staff. A non-blind member of the study staff will weigh the corresponding&#xD;
      investigational product and pass on to the blind member only a spatula with the weighed&#xD;
      product, in order to maintain the blinded aspect of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For exploratory purposes, clinical and mycological evaluations will also be performed after 7&#xD;
      and after 14 days of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis will be performed considering all the randomized patients to which at least&#xD;
      one dose of the investigational products has been applied, regardless of the result of the&#xD;
      fungal culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion of non-inferiority will be based on the per protocol set. It will be deemed as per&#xD;
      protocol those participants who do not miss more than 20% of the applications and, also, no&#xD;
      more than four consecutive application days.&#xD;

    <description>Proportion of participants, in each treatment group, who achieved therapeutic cure, defined as both clinical cure and mycological cure, on the assessment performed after 28 days of treatment.&#xD;
Clinical cure is defined as a score ≤ 2 for the sum of scores attributed to each sign or symptom (erythema, maceration/peeling, fissuring/cracking, itching and burning) as evaluated by a four-point categorical scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe).&#xD;
Mycological cure is defined as negative result for the direct mycological examination (potassium hydroxide [KOH] test) and a negative fungal culture.</description>
