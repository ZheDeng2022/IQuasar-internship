      This study evaluates the medical device Newbreez LD is designed to protect the lower airways&#xD;
      from saliva, liquids and food aspirations in tracheotomized patients suffering from chronic&#xD;
      aspirations that require specific care and may lead to complications, including inhalation&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from swallowing disorders characterized by chronic aspirations (repeated&#xD;
      episodes of aspirations defined as penetration of material - liquids, food, saliva, into the&#xD;
      respiratory system due to a malfunctioning of the swallowing mechanism) are subject to&#xD;
      pathologies and pulmonary insufficiencies. The risks of aspiration pneumonia or suffocation&#xD;
      are significantly greater if the patient is not able to expectorate and thus engages the&#xD;
      vital prognosis. There are several methods to treat chronic aspirations: the least invasive&#xD;
      methods involve adopting postures and/or positions of the body during swallowing and adapting&#xD;
      food textures; when these treatments are insufficient there is the need to recur to more&#xD;
      advanced ones to protect the airways and keep the patient on a sufficient nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these severe cases, heavier surgical methods can be also considered. These methods lead&#xD;
      to important anatomical changes, with a variable degree of reversibility, up to&#xD;
      irreversibility (eg total laryngectomy). Among surgical methods, there is also an implant of&#xD;
      a tracheotomy cuffed cannula that allows patient to breathe through a hole in the trachea.&#xD;
      The efficacy of this solution is highly controversial as reported by numerous studies and&#xD;
      several adverse effects are reported on the tracheal duct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the interest of a prosthetic treatment and the disadvantages of the current methods&#xD;
      and devices, PROTiP Medical has developed a closed intra-laryngeal implant: NewBreez LD. This&#xD;
      device is innovative because its geometry has been optimized to conform totally to the&#xD;
      anatomy of the larynx with the aim to ensure a sealing against saliva, liquids and food&#xD;
      aspirations.&#xD;
