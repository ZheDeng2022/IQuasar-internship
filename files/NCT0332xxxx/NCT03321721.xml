  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand and feet lacerations are common in children with repair often requiring conscious&#xD;
      sedation and needle sticks for repair. Growing evidence in adults reveal that many of these&#xD;
      small lacerations do quite well cosmetically without intervention. This randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial will evaluated the cosmetic outcome at 4 months in two groups of children with hand or&#xD;
      feet lacerations &lt;2 cm comparing suturing vs conservative wound management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes of 2 repair methods in simple (&lt;2cm) hand&#xD;
      and feet lacerations in the pediatric population (2-17 yrs). Our hypothesis is that there is&#xD;
      no statistical difference in cosmetic outcomes between suture repair and non-repair of these&#xD;
      injuries. This study has been performed in the adult population, but has not yet been done in&#xD;
      children. The researchers would like to be the first to show that conservative repair can be&#xD;
      done in our pediatric population. The suture group will have their injuries repaired with&#xD;
      non-absorbable sutures (nylon) which remain the gold standard in cosmetic repair of hands and&#xD;
      feet. The conservative group will have identical cleaning and preparation of the wound, but&#xD;
      the laceration will be covered with antibiotic ointment and sterile gauze without repair.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure include patient satisfaction, infection rates, pain during repair,&#xD;
      time of initial ED visit stay, and cost of supplies used in repair. Our patients will return&#xD;
      in 10 -14 days for follow up and in 4 months for evaluation of the wound and for digital&#xD;
      pictures to be taken of the wound. Wounds and scars will be evaluated at both 10 -14 days and&#xD;
      4 months by both the researchers and the parents or care givers. A satisfaction survey will&#xD;
      be administered to the parent or guardian. At 3-4 months, digital photographs of the healing&#xD;
      lacerations will be graded for appearance by clinicians blinded to the repair method. The&#xD;
      initial visit will be billed to their insurance and the follow-up visits will be free.&#xD;

    <description>Randomized, parallel group study will compare cosmetic outcome by digital picture by blinded evaluators at 4 months post enrollment.&#xD;
The digital pictures of the laceration repairs were scored using a previously validated Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS scale is a 100-mm continuous line that is marked at the right end with &quot;best appearance/scar&quot;(score 100), and on the left end with &quot;worst appearance/scar&quot; (score 0).</description>
