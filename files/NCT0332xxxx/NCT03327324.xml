  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test potential functional/psychosocial benefits of improved&#xD;
      sleep using a program designed to teach nursing facility staff to improve sleep promoting&#xD;
      strategies and environment for nursing home residents. Sleep disturbances are quite common in&#xD;
      skilled nursing facilities and affect as many as 69% of residents while staff do not fully&#xD;
      understand how to improve sleep without using medications. Medications for sleep are commonly&#xD;
      used as first-line therapy for older adults but this is problematic because these medications&#xD;
      can lead to greater problems with thinking, more frequent falls, and even worse sleep over&#xD;
      time. In addition, poor sleep can lead to depressed mood, greater trouble with thinking and&#xD;
      memory, worse pain, and greater need for help with daily activities.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Suspended</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to the COVID19 pandemic, as of March 14, 2020, all nursing homes in New York were on&#xD;
    lockdown, as a result, all of the recruitment efforts have been on pause until further notice.&#xD;

    <measure>Measure of Subjective sleep quality using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components):subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure of Mood using Brief Anxiety and Depression Scale (BADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Total score is determined by adding together the scores for each of the 4 items. Scores are rated as normal (0-2), mild (3-5),moderate (6-8), and severe (9-12). Any woman with a positive screen (mild, moderate or severe) should be assessed for suicidal ideation. A positive score, the presence of suicidal ideation and/or your clinical judgment can indicate that further assessment is warranted.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Cognitive Assessment Tool (BCAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>consists of five assessment tools that allow the clinician or administrator to accurately assess current cognitive and mood functioning. There are 21 items and the total possible score is 50 points. The full BCAT can be administered in 10-15 minutes by professionals and techs, is sensitive to the full spectrum of cognitive functioning (normal, MCI, mild dementia, moderate-severe dementia), produces separate Memory Factor and Executive Functions Factor scores, and can predict basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL, IADL).</description>

    <description>SLUMBER is a non-pharmacological intervention program, delivered by providing mentoring to facility staff who work directly with residents. SLUMBER focuses on detecting sleep-disruptive factors including: nighttime noise and patient behaviors associated with poor sleep quality; disruptions caused by nighttime caregiving; daytime inactivity; and limited light exposure. In this model, staff-delivered interventions to improve these factors improve sleep quality thereby creating opportunities to test the impact of improving sleep quality (measured by actigraphy) on mood (depression and anxiety), pain, cognitive function, functional ability, and observed activity levels.</description>

          -  capacity to consent assessed with standard questions used to assess capacity or having&#xD;
             a surrogate who can provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Does not have capacity and does not show enthusiasm for the research&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  inability to consent and without surrogate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  non-English and non-Spanish speaking. In keeping with QI strategies, all residents&#xD;
             will be exposed to the environmental aspects of the intervention, as these strategies&#xD;
             represent clinically proven non-experimental behavioral strategies with no perceptible&#xD;
             harm.&#xD;
