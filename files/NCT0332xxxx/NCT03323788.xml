      We are trying to understand how insulin (a type of hormone in the body that regulates how the&#xD;
      body regulates how one metabolizes protein and carbohydrates) and exercise alter proteins&#xD;
      involved in energy production and metabolism in skeletal muscle.&#xD;

      (Aims 1-3) We are trying to understand how insulin (a type of hormone in the body that&#xD;
      regulates how the body regulates how one metabolizes protein and carbohydrates) and exercise&#xD;
      alter proteins involved in energy production and metabolism in skeletal muscle. By studying&#xD;
      this, they hope to better understand the causes of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      Insulin is a hormone that is produced normally in the body and causes blood sugar to return&#xD;
      to normal after eating. Insulin resistance is a state when the body is not using insulin&#xD;
      correctly, and more insulin is needed to keep blood sugar concentrations normal. Insulin&#xD;
      resistance can lead to Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which blood sugar&#xD;
      levels are too high. Our studies may help to find out why some people develop Type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and how exercise may prevent this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 4) We are asking patients from aims 1-3 to take part in this research study because they&#xD;
      have high triglycerides that could be treated anyway with fibrates, and they do not have&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triglycerides and cholesterol are the two main kinds of fat that are in blood. People who&#xD;
      have high triglycerides have some health risks and are sometimes treated with drugs called&#xD;
      &quot;fibrates&quot;. This drug turns on a protein in ones body that controls the activity of some of&#xD;
      the genes that make it easier for their liver to get rid of triglycerides. We think that&#xD;
      maybe this same gene, in ones muscle, can lower the ability of genes in ones muscle to&#xD;
      respond beneficially to exercise, but we don't know if this is true.&#xD;

    <description>Aim 1. To determine whether the transcription factor expression response to exercise is dysregulated in muscle from type 2 diabetic patients. We will test the hypothesis that MZF1, NFKB1, RELA, SP1/KLF and EGR1 responses to an acute exercise bout are reduced in insulin resistant patients with type 2 diabetes.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Aim 2</arm_group_label>
    <description>Aim 2. To determine how insulin resistance changes the response of post-translational modifications of SP1/KLF family and MZF1 transcription factors to acute exercise in muscle from type 2 diabetic patients. We will test the hypothesis that:&#xD;
SP1/KLF2, 4, and 6 and phosphorylation/acetylation and MZF1 phosphorylation is altered in response to acute exercise.&#xD;
The response of SP1/KLF2, 4, and 6 phosphorylation and acetylation and MZF1 phosphorylation to acute exercise is abnormal in patients with type 2 diabetes.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Aim 3</arm_group_label>
    <description>Aim 3. To define the response of miRNAs to acute exercise in healthy and insulin resistant muscle from obese and type 2 diabetic patients. We will test the hypotheses that:&#xD;
The exercise-induced increases in expression of miR-378 members and miR-128 are lower in obese and type 2 diabetic muscle than in lean healthy controls.&#xD;
FOXO1 expression, a target of miR-378 and miR-128, is higher in obese and type 2 diabetic muscle and this is accompanied by decreased FOXO1 phosphorylation.&#xD;
The exercise-induced increases in expression of miR-30 family members, miR-10a, miR-422a, and miR-532 are lower in obese and type 2 diabetic muscle.&#xD;
There are novel miRNAs that regulate the transcriptional program induced by acute exercise and are dysregulated in insulin resistance.</description>
