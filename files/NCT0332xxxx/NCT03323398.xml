  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of mRNA-2416&#xD;
      alone and in combination with administered fixed doses of durvalumab in participants with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma, as well as the objective response&#xD;
      rate (ORR) of mRNA-2416 alone or in combination with durvalumab in ovarian cancer based on&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The applicable dose of mRNA-2416&#xD;
      will be injected directly into the participant's tumor (intratumoral) and the applicable dose&#xD;
      of durvalumab will be administered intravenously.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and efficacy&#xD;
      study designed to determine the safety and tolerability of repeated intratumoral injections&#xD;
      of mRNA-2416 alone (Arm A) and in combination with intravenously administered durvalumab (Arm&#xD;
      B) in participants with advanced relapsed/refractory solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma and&#xD;
      to assess the ORR of mRNA-2416 alone and in combination with durvalumab in ovarian cancer&#xD;
      based on RECIST v1.1. The study includes 2 treatment arms (mRNA-2416 monotherapy [Arm A],and&#xD;
      mRNA-2416 + durvalumab [Arm B]), each arm of the study consists of a Dose Escalation period&#xD;
      in non-visceral lesions followed by a Dose Confirmation period in visceral lesions and an&#xD;
      Expansion period in participants with ovarian cancer at the MTD/RDE as determined by the Dose&#xD;
      Escalation period. Once the expected maximum tolerated dose/recommended dose for expansion&#xD;
      (MTD/RDE) has been cleared in Dose Escalation for Arm A, Dose Escalation for Arm B will begin&#xD;
      with mRNA-2416 at 1 dose level lower than the Arm A MTD/RDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of 6 cycles of mRNA-2416 + durvalumab (Arm B), participants may continue&#xD;
      with durvalumab alone until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 24 months of&#xD;
      treatment (total), whichever is sooner.&#xD;
