  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Localized cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is usually treated by radical surgery with&#xD;
      or without radiotherapy. The cure rate is high around 90% of cases (1). Unresectable CSCC&#xD;
      represents less than 10% of all CSCC. The prognosis of these advanced forms is poor, without&#xD;
      any proven treatment option. The number of studies investigating systemic treatment of&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic CSCC is limited, mostly based on phase II trials or case reports.&#xD;
      Systemic treatment includes cytotoxic chemotherapy such as cisplatin and 5-Fluoro-uracil&#xD;
      (5FU), immunotherapy (interferon alpha) or retinoic acid (13CRa) (1,2). Recently, epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting agents have been explored (1,2). The anti-EGFR&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody Cetuximab has shown some clinical efficacy in advanced CSCC alone or&#xD;
      concomitant with radiotherapy or chemotherapy (3-5). A recent phase II study aimed at&#xD;
      investigating the role of Cetuximab in 36 patients with unresectable CSCC (6). The authors&#xD;
      reported a disease control rate at 6 weeks of 69% (95% CI, 52% to 84%). The best responses&#xD;
      were eight partial responses and two complete responses. There were no Cetuximab-related&#xD;
      deaths. There were three related serious adverse events: two grade 4 infusion reactions and&#xD;
      one grade 3 interstitial pneumopathy. Grade 1 to 2 acne-like rash occurred in 78% of patients&#xD;
      and was associated with prolonged Progression Free Survival (PFS) (6). The authors concluded&#xD;
      that regarding the Cetuximab therapeutic index it could be interesting in this particular&#xD;
      situation mainly for elderly patient. Unfortunately, the small number of patient included not&#xD;
      allowed to draw definitive conclusion. It was interesting to note that the Disease rate&#xD;
      control (DRC) with Cetuximab increased of 15% comparatively of DRC with chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Additionally it seems that in case of efficacy the functional improvement of&#xD;
      Cetuximab-sensitive patients occurred after very few infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking these data together it seemed logical to design a larger retrospective clinical trial&#xD;
      to confirm these results in &quot;real life patients&quot;.&#xD;
