  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is a widely used, highly accurate&#xD;
      technique for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD), with sensitivity and negative&#xD;
      predictive values of over 90% (1-4). Patients with normal CTA findings have an excellent&#xD;
      prognosis and do not require further testing for CAD (5). However, like invasive coronary&#xD;
      angiography (QCA), CTA is an anatomic test and, unless lesions are very severe (&gt;90%&#xD;
      stenosis), cannot reliably predict the impairment of flow (functional significance) of&#xD;
      intermediate grade stenoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, in approximately 15-25% of patients, additional functional testing may be&#xD;
      required after CTA, usually in the form of stress testing (6-8). Stress testing is commonly&#xD;
      done by exercise or pharmacologic stress with electrocardiographic monitoring and often,&#xD;
      imaging of myocardial perfusion by nuclear scintigraphy (MPI) or detection of abnormal&#xD;
      contraction by echocardiography. This requires a separate procedure, entailing time, expense&#xD;
      and limited risk. Furthermore, in patients with previously known CAD, CTA alone is not an&#xD;
      adequate test, because in most cases there are multiple lesions that are possible sources of&#xD;
      ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 10 years, these investigators and others around the world have developed a&#xD;
      method of imaging myocardial perfusion by CT (CTP). This test is an adjunct to the usual&#xD;
      Cardiac Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) procedure and can be done immediately&#xD;
      thereafter, using conventional pharmacologic stress agents. It has demonstrated accuracy in&#xD;
      many single center trials, and in this large multicenter study, the CORE320 trial (9,10)&#xD;
      which showed a high accuracy in predicting the combined results of QCA plus MPI testing and a&#xD;
      second multicenter trial established non-inferiority of myocardial CTP compared with nuclear&#xD;
      stress testing (11,12). Additionally, this investigator group has published a direct&#xD;
      comparison of diagnostic performance of myocardial CTP imaging and SPECT myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      imaging and demonstrated superior diagnostic performance of CTP imaging compared with SPECT&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of significant disease on invasive angiography (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTP images can be acquired with two different approaches: static or dynamic. In the CORE320&#xD;
      study, the CTP protocol used static acquisition method. The static CTP method, samples a&#xD;
      snapshot of the iodine distribution in the blood pool and the myocardium over a short period&#xD;
      of time, targeting either the upslope or the peak of contrast bolus. The notion behind this&#xD;
      is that, at the upslope of the contrast, the difference in attenuation value of the ischemic&#xD;
      and remote myocardium is at the maximum which enables for qualitative and semi-quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of myocardial perfusion defects. The static CTP, however, does not allow for&#xD;
      direct quantification of the myocardial blood flow (MBF). One of the drawbacks of static CTP&#xD;
      lies in the acquirement of only one sample of data and the possibility of mistiming of the&#xD;
      contrast bolus that results in poor contrast-to-tissue ratios by missing the peak attenuation&#xD;
      (14). Output and flow rate of the contrast material may affect bolus timing. In addition, the&#xD;
      acquisition of data from sequential heartbeats affects the attenuation gradient and may&#xD;
      result in a heterogeneous iodine distribution, mimicking perfusion defects (15). Furthermore,&#xD;
      the static CTP is limited in detection of balanced ischemia, where the perfusion of the&#xD;
      entire myocardium is impaired and therefore there is no reference remote myocardium for&#xD;
      comparison for semi-quantitative or qualitative static methods of CTP interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic CT perfusion imaging uses serial imaging over time to record the kinetics of&#xD;
      iodinated contrast in the arterial blood pool and myocardium. This technique allows for&#xD;
      multiple sampling of the myocardium and the blood pool and creating time attenuation curves&#xD;
      (TAC) by measuring the change in CT attenuation over time. Mathematical modelling of TACs&#xD;
      permits for direct quantification of MBF. Despite its advantages, the use of dynamic CTP were&#xD;
      limited in the past. A high temporal resolution and high number of detectors are required for&#xD;
      dynamic CTP to allow for entire myocardial coverage, and in order to obtain multiple&#xD;
      consecutive images at high heart rates(16,17). But the main challenge of dynamic CTP&#xD;
      acquisition was the high radiation dose associated with this technique. Nevertheless, with&#xD;
      the introduction of the cutting-edge 320 detector CT scanning systems with fast gantry&#xD;
      rotation the issue of the cardiac coverage is eliminated(17). The second-generation 320-row&#xD;
      scanners also permit the quantification of the MBF with dynamic CTP acquisition with&#xD;
      relatively low-dose of radiation(18,19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility, safety and accuracy of the&#xD;
      low-radiation dose dynamic myocardial CT perfusion compared to static CTP approach to detect&#xD;
      hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective study comparing the low-dose dynamic vs. static CTP combined with&#xD;
      the CTA for detecting hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to assess the feasibility, safety and accuracy of low-dose dynamic CTP following&#xD;
      CTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll patients who have documented coronary artery disease and an indication&#xD;
      for coronary angiography or CT angiography. Referred patients will be assessed for&#xD;
      eligibility through phone calls followed by in-person interviews. Patents will be provided&#xD;
      with the informed consent forms for CTA-CTP and iodine contrast if it is determined that&#xD;
      participants are eligible for the study. Patients have the right to refuse to participate in&#xD;
      the study and in that case participants will receive the regular care, per clinical&#xD;
      guidelines. Baseline information will be collected from the patients after participants&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study. Baseline data collection will happen at the same day&#xD;
      that the patients will undergo CTA-CTP. The CTA-CTP acquisition takes less than 60 minutes&#xD;
      after the patient is on the CT scanner table. Patient preparation time before patient is&#xD;
      brought on the CT scanner depends on patients' heart rate and the time that takes to reduce&#xD;
      patient's heart rate to a level that is appropriate for CTA-CTP acquisition. The blood sample&#xD;
      will be obtained from the patients at the same day as CTA-CTP acquisition. Patients will be&#xD;
      discharged to home at the same day participants undergo CTA-CTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants. There will be&#xD;
      only one visit required for the purposes of the study, during which the CTA-CTP acquisition&#xD;
      will be completed, baseline information will be collected and the blood samples will be&#xD;
      drawn. The study participants will be contacted through phone 3-days after CTA-CTP&#xD;
      acquisition for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT Imaging protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have two 18-20 gauge intravenous lines placed, one preferably in an antecubital&#xD;
      vein for contrast administration. The patient will be hydrated with normal saline&#xD;
      intravenously (250 - 500 ml) prior to CT scanning. The patient will lie supine on the scanner&#xD;
      table and be attached to a 12 lead electrocardiographic monitor and an automated blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor. Baseline ECG, heart rate, and blood pressure will be recorded and reviewed&#xD;
      by one of the study investigators. Due to resultant artifacts from precordial leads, the 12&#xD;
      ECG leads and electrodes will be removed and rhythm monitoring will continue using the 3 lead&#xD;
      system attached to the scanners monitoring system during scanning. A physician will be&#xD;
      present at all times during adenosine infusion and CT imaging. Patients may receive an oral&#xD;
      and/or intravenous dose of metoprolol up to one hour prior to the CT. If the heart rate is&#xD;
      &gt;60 beats per minute, 75 mg (max 80 mg) of metoprolol will be given orally. If Heart rate&#xD;
      remains &gt;60 beats per minute at the scan acquisition then, intravenous beta blocker&#xD;
      (metoprolol, propranolol or landiolol) 2.5 - 5.0 mg every 5 minutes will be administered to&#xD;
      achieve a heart rate between &lt;60 beats per minute as blood pressure tolerates under the&#xD;
      supervision of a physician. Scout images for determining scanning range will be obtained in&#xD;
      the anterior-posterior and lateral views. Patients with systolic blood pressure ≥110 will&#xD;
      receive sublingual fast acting short lasting nitrates (e.g. nitroglycerin, isosorbide&#xD;
      dinitrate). Patients will then be asked to hold their breath (approximately 10-15 seconds)&#xD;
      and non-contrast CT imaging will be performed starting just cranial to the coronary ostia and&#xD;
      extending just caudal to the apex of the heart in order to obtain a coronary calcium score.&#xD;
      CT angiogram will be performed to evaluate the coronaries and myocardial perfusion at rest.&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be checked and intravenous adenosine infusion (0.14 mg/kg/min) will begin&#xD;
      with continuous heart rate and rhythm monitoring. After 5 minutes of adenosine infusion,&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced CT perfusion imaging will be performed during a 4-5 ml/sec intravenous&#xD;
      iodinated contrast (ISOVUE®-370) infusion. Total contrast dose for the entire protocol will&#xD;
      not exceed 140 ml and will be based on patient's body size. Patients will be asked to hold&#xD;
      their breath during scanning. Immediately following completion of the scan, the adenosine&#xD;
      infusion will be discontinued. A twelve lead ECG and blood pressure measurement will be&#xD;
      repeated after discontinuation of adenosine and reviewed by a physician. Intravenous&#xD;
      hydration will be continued during recovery with normal saline for a total volume for the&#xD;
      entire post scan of 250 to 500 ml if deemed appropriate by the supervising physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      320-Detector CT Protocol for Combined Coronary Angiography and Perfusion Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Coronary calcium scan will be performed using the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CT Imaging: tube voltage = 120kV, tube current = 140 mA, gantry rotation speed =&#xD;
                0.35 seconds, slice thickness = 0.5 mm, rows = 256-320, range = 128-160 mm. X-ray&#xD;
                tube will be on for a total of 0.35 seconds. Estimated radiation dose = 1.5 mSv.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rest coronary arterial imaging Rest perfusion and coronary arterial imaging will be&#xD;
           performed during a 4-5 ml/sec intravenous iodinated contrast (ISOVUE®-370) infusion. The&#xD;
           rest CTA-dynamic CTP images will be started using a test bolus acquisition and accurate&#xD;
           quantification of optimum timing for dynamic CTP and boost CTA acquisition and will&#xD;
           continue for 20-30 sec using a ECG triggering method to allow acquiring the images only&#xD;
           within 70-80% of the R-R interval, but not continuously. The parameters for the dynamic&#xD;
           CTP image acquisition are the followings: For the heart rate of &lt;60 bpm the tube voltage&#xD;
           will be 80 kV and the tube current will be 100mA. Other parameters are: gantry&#xD;
           rotation=0.275, range=120mm. The CTA and static CTP imaging will be performed as a boost&#xD;
           scan during the dynamic CTP with the same tube voltage (80kV) but the tube current of&#xD;
           600mA within 70-80% of R-R interval. The boost timing will be quantified from test bolus&#xD;
           acquisition. The average radiation dose for rest CTA and rest dynamic and static CTP&#xD;
           acquisition is 3.69mSv.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stress Myocardial Perfusion imaging 20 minutes after rest image acquisition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be checked and intravenous adenosine infusion will begin with continuous&#xD;
      heart rate and rhythm monitoring. After 5 minutes of adenosine infusion, contrast-enhanced CT&#xD;
      perfusion imaging will be performed during a 4-5 ml/sec intravenous iodinated contrast&#xD;
      (ISOVUE®-370) infusion. The stress dynamic CTP images will be started using a test bolus&#xD;
      acquisition and accurate quantification of optimum timing for dynamic CTP and boost CTA&#xD;
      acquisition and will continue for 20-30 sec using a ECG triggering method to allow acquiring&#xD;
      the images only within 70-80% of the R-R interval, but not continuously. The parameters for&#xD;
      the stress dynamic CTP image acquisition are the followings: For the heart rate of &lt;80 bpm&#xD;
      the tube voltage will be 80 kV and the tube current will be 100mA. Other parameters are:&#xD;
      gantry rotation=0.275, range=120mm. The stress static CTP imaging will be performed as a&#xD;
      boost scan during the stress dynamic CTP with the same tube voltage (80kV) but the tube&#xD;
      current of 600mA within 70-80% of R-R interval. The boost timing will be quantified from test&#xD;
      bolus acquisition. The average radiation dose for stress dynamic and static CTP acquisition&#xD;
      is 5.17mSv. The scan parameters are summarized in the table below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HR kV mA Rot Range Cardiac Phase Total Scan Time Boost Skip beat CTDIVol DLP Dose [mSv] Dose&#xD;
      Sum [mSv] CAC score 120 140 0.35 120 70-80 0.35 1.5 10.551 Test Bolus every 2s 33.8 13 0.182&#xD;
      CTA-CTP Rest 60 80 100 0.275 120 70-80 25 V 600mA 22 264.1 3.6974 Stress 80 80 100 0.275 120&#xD;
      70-80 25 V 600mA 30.8 369.4 5.1716&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated average radiation dose for the entire cardiac computed protocol is 10.55 mSv&#xD;
      and shall not exceed 15mSv. Beta-blockers will be used to control the heart rate and thus&#xD;
      maintain the radiation dose as low as reasonably achievable. The total contrast dose will not&#xD;
      exceed 140 ml. Depending on patient size, 50-70 ml of iodinated contrast will be used for&#xD;
      each of rest and stress scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that the CT raw data are not readable at the Johns Hopkins University, a copy of&#xD;
      the raw data (anonymized without patient identifiers) will be transferred to Toshiba Medical&#xD;
      Systems for engineering support of image reconstruction in these isolated cases. Toshiba&#xD;
      Medical Systems will perform the image reconstruction and return the raw data and the&#xD;
      reconstructed image data to the Johns Hopkins University for image analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 weeks of the CT, the CT will be reviewed for non-cardiac findings by a locally&#xD;
      qualified, institutionally approved cardiologist and reported to the patient's clinical&#xD;
      physician and patient in a timely fashion preferably prior to or during the 30-day follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic and static CTP images will be analyzed separately and when analyzing the CTP images&#xD;
      with each method, the readers will be blinded to the results the other method. However the&#xD;
      readers will have access to the results for CTA interpretation while reading the CTP images&#xD;
      with either of static or dynamic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Justification of why participants will not receive routine care or will have current&#xD;
      therapy stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be only enrolling patients with an indication for CTA or invasive coronary&#xD;
      angiography and will undergo these tests. So routine care will be delivered to the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Study Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Primary outcome variable. The primary outcome measures will be feasibility, safety and&#xD;
      accuracy of dynamic CTP-CTA compared to static CTP-CTA to detect hemodynamically significant&#xD;
      coronary artery stenosis. The hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis will be&#xD;
      defined as having at least one vessel with a ≥50% stenosis associated with perfusion defect&#xD;
      in static CTP images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the index visit, failure to complete the CTP protocol will constitute an incomplete study&#xD;
      and such patients will be excluded from the per protocol analysis. All patients completing&#xD;
      the CTP protocol and providing informed consent will be included in per-protocol analyses.&#xD;
      All data from all consented patients who do not complete the CTP protocol will be included in&#xD;
      the intent-to-diagnose analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be given for all variables including indications for the test,&#xD;
      demographics, patient history, CTA test information, dynamic and static CTP information.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be summarized as counts and percentages. All continuous variables&#xD;
      will be summarized as means+/- the standard deviation followed by the median, minimum and&#xD;
      maximum and 25th, 75th percentiles where needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of the primary safety outcomes [death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina,&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia, asystole, severe bradycardia, allergic skin reactions, allergic&#xD;
      respiratory reactions, hypotension, anaphylaxis and contrast induced nephropathy] will all be&#xD;
      summarized; 95% binomial confidence intervals for the proportions of these outcomes will be&#xD;
      calculated. The additional safety outcomes involving CTP complications will be summarized&#xD;
      with frequencies and 95% confidence intervals for proportions. Radiation dose and efficiency&#xD;
      measures (duration(s) involving the CTP procedure) will be summarized overall with median and&#xD;
      25th and 75th percentiles. Also minima and maxima will be provided. The investigators may&#xD;
      explore possible associations between patient characteristics [demographics (gender, age),&#xD;
      prior histories or indications] and the binary safety outcomes using contingency table&#xD;
      methods, t tests or Wilcoxon Rank Sum, as appropriate. Associations between radiation dose&#xD;
      and patient characteristics may be explored with nonparametric methods. The investigators may&#xD;
      also explore possible relationships between the CTA stenosis categories (0%, 1-49%, 50-100%)&#xD;
      and the dynamic and static CTP results. The occurrence of clinical events recorded at 30-day&#xD;
      chart review will be related to the category of CTP final results (Normal, Probably Normal,&#xD;
      Equivocal, Probably Abnormal and Abnormal) using methods for contingency tables which&#xD;
      incorporate the natural ordering of CTP categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of the studies with the adequate image quality for interpretation of dynamic&#xD;
      CTP images will be reported as a measure is feasibility. This feasibility index will be also&#xD;
      reported at the myocardial segment level and the frequency of Left Ventricular (LV) segments&#xD;
      with adequate dynamic CTP image quality will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inter- and intra-reader reproducibility of dynamic CTP interpretation will be assessed&#xD;
      using kappa statistics, intra-class correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plot, as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy of the dynamic CTP for detection of hemodynamically significant coronary artery&#xD;
      stenosis will be based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve&#xD;
      (AUC) with the static CTP results as the comparator. The correlation of the dynamic vs.&#xD;
      static CTP will be also assessed in the categorical (Chi-squared test) and continuous&#xD;
      (Spearman's correlation coefficient) scale.&#xD;

    <description>This will be a prospective study comparing the low-dose dynamic vs. static CTP combined with the CTA for detecting hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis. Patients will have two 18-20 gauge intravenous lines placed for contrast administration. The following image sequences will be completed: coronary calcium scan (non-contrast), rest coronary arterial imaging (with 4-5 mL/sec intravenous ISOVUE-370 infusion), stress myocardial perfusion imaging 20 minutes after rest acquisition imaging (blood pressure will be checked then an infusion of adenosine will be started for a total of 5 minutes; after 5 minutes of adenosine infusion, CT perfusion imaging will be performed during a 4-5 mL/sec ISOVUE-370 infusion). Total estimated radiation dose: 10.551 mSv.</description>
