  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of BOS172722 when&#xD;
      administered as monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel in participants with advanced&#xD;
      nonhaematologic malignancies and also to establish the maximum tolerated dose and recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose of BOS172722 in combination with paclitaxel in those participants.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>a minimum of approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product (IP), whether or not related to the IP. AEs include pre-existing conditions that worsen.</description>

    <description>BOS172722 will be administered on Cycle 0 Day 1 and on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 in Cycle 1 and subsequent 28-day cycles in participants with histopathologically confirmed advanced nonhaematologic malignancies. The participants will also receive 80 milligrams per meters squared (mg/m^2) paclitaxel as an intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. During dose escalation, further exploration of the treatment schedule for the BOS172722-paclitaxel combination will be initiated. In such combination cohorts, BOS172722 will be administered with paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 only of each treatment cycle (except for Cycle 2 Day1), and will not be administered on Day 2, 9, and 16. These alternative schedules will be explored to further characterize the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of such a dosing regimen.</description>
