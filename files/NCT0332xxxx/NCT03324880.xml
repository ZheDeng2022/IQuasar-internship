  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recombinant human parathyroid hormone, also known as if rhPTH(1-84), is a medicine to treat&#xD;
      people with Hypothyroidism. The main aim of this study is to learn if rhPTH(1-84) can improve&#xD;
      symptoms in adults with hypoparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will receive 1 of 2 treatments: rhPTH(1-84) or a placebo. A&#xD;
      placebo looks like the medicine being studied but does not have medicine in it. In this&#xD;
      study, the placebo will be a standard treatment which is either active Vitamin D, or active&#xD;
      Vitamin D with calcium. Active Vitamin D is a form of vitamin D that has a faster effect on&#xD;
      the body. These treatments will be given as a daily injection just under the skin.&#xD;
      Participants will not know which treatment they received, nor will their study doctors. This&#xD;
      is to help make sure the results are more reliable. All participants will also take active&#xD;
      vitamin D and calcium supplements during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will record their symptoms in a tool called the hypoparathyroidism symptom&#xD;
      diary. This tool is used to assess symptoms and their impact and will give an overall score&#xD;
      for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctors will also check for side effects from the study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, researchers will check if there is any difference in the diary scores&#xD;
      between the 2 treatment groups. A difference in score means there is a difference in symptoms&#xD;
      and their impact. From this, researchers will learn if symptoms have improved for&#xD;
      participants treated with rhPTH(1-84) compared with those treated with placebo.&#xD;

      24 SEPTEMBER 2020: The temporary enrollment stop of new patients into this study due to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic has been lifted in one or more countries, and the study is now again&#xD;
      enrolling new patients. However, some countries/sites may still have paused the enrollment of&#xD;
      new patients due to the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 APRIL 2020: Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19&#xD;
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The HPT-SD is a 13-item patient-reported outcomes instrument that consists of the following items: symptom subscale (items 1-7), anxiety (item 8), sadness and depression (item 9) and impact subscale (items 10-13). For items 1-9, the individual score ranges from None=0 to Very severe=4 and for items 10-13, it ranges from Not at all=0 to Very much=2. For symptom subscale score, the average score of the symptom items 1-7 will be calculated.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Any disease that might affect calcium metabolism or calcium-phosphate homeostasis&#xD;
             other than hypoparathyroidism, such as poorly controlled hyperthyroidism; Paget&#xD;

             disease; Cushing syndrome; rheumatoid arthritis; myeloma; active pancreatitis;&#xD;
             malnutrition; rickets; recent prolonged immobility; active malignancy (other than&#xD;

             hyperparathyroidism; or documented parathyroid carcinoma within the previous 5 years,&#xD;
             acromegaly, or multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Very low or very high blood calcium level (eg, ACSC &lt;1.87 mmol/L [&lt;7.5 mg/dL] or&#xD;
             &gt;=2.97 mmol/L [&gt;=11.9 mg/dL]) at the Week -3 screening visit. Results from the central&#xD;

             corticosteroids, within respective prohibited periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any other investigational study in which receipt of investigational&#xD;
             drug or device occurred within 6 months before screening for this study. Prior&#xD;
             treatment with PTH-like drugs (whether commercially available or through participation&#xD;
             in an investigational study), including PTH(1-84), PTH(1-34), or other N-terminal&#xD;
             fragments or analogs of PTH or PTH-related protein, within 3 months before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of other drugs known to influence calcium and bone metabolism, such as calcitonin,&#xD;
             fluoride tablets, or cinacalcet hydrochloride, within the prohibited period.&#xD;

          -  Use of oral bisphosphonates within the previous 6 months or intravenous bisphosphonate&#xD;
             preparations within the previous 24 months before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonhypocalcemic seizure disorder with a history of a seizure within the previous 6&#xD;

             setting of hypocalcemia are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is at increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma, such as those with&#xD;
             Paget's disease of bone or unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase, hereditary&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
