      1. RATIONALE All-ceramic endocrowns are bonded to the tooth using adhesive resins creating&#xD;
           strong bonds to the tooth structure resulting in strengthening effect and reducing the&#xD;
           need for post and core. various CAD/CAM materials can be used for the fabrication of&#xD;
           endocrowns including lithium-disilicate reinforced glass-ceramics, feldspathic ceramics,&#xD;
           in ceram alumina and in ceram spinell as well as hybrid ceramics and composites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fewer data are available on the clinical performance of the different materials used for&#xD;
           endocrowns. With the rapid innovation in the dental restorative materials clinicians are&#xD;
           sometimes confused when selecting the best restorative material to restore an&#xD;
           endodontically treated tooth with an endocrown. This is due to lack of data with regard&#xD;
           to clinical performance of these restorations as well as the degree of patient&#xD;
           satisfaction.&#xD;

      II. Introduction 6.a. Background and rational 6.a.1. Background Endodontically treated teeth&#xD;
      often show marked coronal mutilation,(1) which influence the structural integrity of such&#xD;
      teeth and pose a higher risk of biomechanical failure than vital teeth.(2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally those teeth are restored using post retained full coverage crowns.(3) Such&#xD;
      treatment was thought to be the ideal way of restoring endodontically treated teeth while&#xD;
      reinforcing the remaining tooth structure.(4) However, it was reported by many authors that&#xD;
      placing a post can enhance the retention of the coronal restoration and the crown but at the&#xD;
      same time carrying out the preparation for post insertion can weaken the remaining tooth&#xD;
      structure, and hence increasing the risk of catastrophic tooth fracture.(5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All-ceramic endocrowns are bonded to the tooth using adhesive resins creating strong bonds to&#xD;
      the tooth structure resulting in strengthening effect and reducing the need for post and&#xD;
      core.(6) various CAD/CAM materials can be used for the fabrication of endocrowns including&#xD;
      lithium-disilicate reinforced glass-ceramics, feldspathic ceramics, in ceram alumina and in&#xD;
      ceram spinell as well as hybrid ceramics and composites.(7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.a.2 Description of research question&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulated question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with endodontically treated molar teeth requiring endocrown restorations, what&#xD;
      are the clinical performance and the level of patient satisfaction of cerasmart endocrown&#xD;
      versus lithium disilicate (e-max) ceramic endocrowns? 6.a.3 Justification for undertaking the&#xD;
      trial: In 2016 Borgia et al. in their retrospective study to report the clinical performance&#xD;
      of 11 endocrowns over a period of 9-18 years concluded that Endocrown being a conservative&#xD;
      and aesthetic approach can be used to restore posterior endodontically treated teeth, mainly&#xD;
      molars, with a very good biomechanical and functional performance, and very acceptable&#xD;
      longevity. (22) Also the clinical performance of ceramic endocrowns showed a survival rate of&#xD;
      99 % and the success rate of 89.9 % in a 10 year retrospective study done by Bellflamme et&#xD;
      al. 2017, where lithium disilicate (IPS Empress 2 or e-max) constituted 84.8 % of the&#xD;
      functioning endocrowns while 12.1 % for polymer infiltrated ceramic (Vita Enamic) and only 3&#xD;
      % for artisanal indirect composite.(7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, lithium disilicate ceramics have disadvantages that may influence the outcome of the&#xD;
      endocrowns, among which is the high stiffness and rigidity owing to the higher modulus of&#xD;
      elasticity (67.2 GPa)(18) compared to natural dentin (18.6 GPa)(19) which may affect the&#xD;
      marginal adaptation.(12) Moreover, high stress values will be induced with a detrimental&#xD;
      effect on the biomechanical behavior of the restorative system when used to replace&#xD;
      dentin.(20)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a biomimetic point of view, the less brittle composite CAD/CAM blocks offer mechanical&#xD;
      properties that are closely related to those of human dentin.(6) Nano ceramic material being&#xD;
      more resilient and having lower stiffness and lower elastic modulus (12.1 GPa)(23) comparable&#xD;
      to that of human dentin (18.6)(24) can act as a cushion and offer force absorption qualities&#xD;
      thus reducing the stresses transferred to the adhesive junction.(25)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of the research to the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will receive a restoration with superior marginal adaptation and quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will provide the patient with long-term predictable prosthetic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of the research to the clinician:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practitioner will have the advantage to assess a new material that can be used in different&#xD;
      situations for better marginal adaptation outcomes and bio integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will improve patient's confidence with the dentist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.b. Explanation for choice of comparators: Ceramic material used for endocrown fabrication&#xD;
      should be of acid etchable quality in order to obtain the necessary retention for such&#xD;
      restoration through the adhesive cementation system.(15) thus lithium disilicate either&#xD;
      machined or pressed seem to be the best restorative options in this case.(26)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012 Biacchi and Basting reported that lithium disilicate ceramics possess a high bonding&#xD;
      capacity to the dental structure which makes them the best restorative materials for&#xD;
      endocrowns.(27)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover lithium disilicates have been reported to offer high mechanical strength combined&#xD;
      with exceptional esthetics which mimics greatly natural tooth appearance.(15) 7.a.&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction of new flexible ceramic material Cerasmart compared to lithium disilicate&#xD;
      endocrowns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.b. Research hypothesis: Cerasmart endocrowns may have better clinical performance if&#xD;
      compared with Lithium disilicate ceramic endocrown restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Trial design: Randomized Clinical Trail (parallel group with 1:1 allocation ratio) A&#xD;
      Superiority trial. III. A. Methods: Participants, interventions, and outcomes 9. Study&#xD;
      setting: This study will be carried out on patients enrolled from the Outpatient clinic in&#xD;

&#xD;
      11. Interventions: 11.a. Main procedures: Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients collecting:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (E.M) will select no of patients from outpatient clinic in fixed prosthodontic&#xD;
           department clinic regarding previously mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Suitable participants will be informed about the experimental trial and the possible&#xD;
           complications that could occur during the period of this experiment. Each participant&#xD;
           will be asked to sign informed consents, which will be provided in patient native&#xD;
           language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tooth preparation and restoration placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (E.M) is responsible for all clinical procedure that will be conducted in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Clinical records will be taken including history, clinical examination and clinical&#xD;
      photographs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographs will be taken for the proposed abutments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary impressions will be taken and poured to obtain the study casts.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. st visit: (E.M) will call all selected participant before tooth preparation&#xD;
                procedure for X-ray reviewing and pre-operative photographing using a digital&#xD;
                camera also; primary impression will be taken using alginate impression material *&#xD;
                for study cast analysis combined with suitable size stock tray**.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. nd visit: (Tooth preparation) After performing adequate disinfection and&#xD;
                sterilization procedures for each instrument and tool that will be used in this&#xD;
                trial, endocrown preparation will be carried out following the principles of&#xD;
                endocrown preparation with a circumferential butt joint margin (of 1.5-2 mm&#xD;
                thickness) with a reduction of at least 2 mm in the axial direction and a central&#xD;
                retention cavity (of 3mm depth) making the coronal pulp chamber and the endodontic&#xD;
                access cavity continuous. Walls less than 2 mm thick will be removed. 1-2 mm of&#xD;
                Flowable composite resin base will be used to fill the undercuts. 2 observers will&#xD;
                select visually the appropriate shade. Secondary impressions will be taken for each&#xD;
                participant in each group using silicon rubber base impression material ***&#xD;
                combined with suitable size tray Impressions will be removed from patient mouth&#xD;
                after final setting and will be checked for accuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be followed by temporization using temporary filling material **** and will be left&#xD;
      till the placement of endocrown in the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impressions will be sent to the lab, which will be poured with extra hard stone material,&#xD;
      after final setting of casts; it will be removed from the impression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Casts will then be scanned using a scanning unit and then data will be saved on the computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restoration fabrication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Cerec in Lab software 4.2, a design of the desired e-max and cerasmart endocrowns will&#xD;
      be planned in the form of a fully anatomical molar with a standardized proposal from the&#xD;
      software this proposal will then be saved on the computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The e-max block as well as the cerasmart block will be fixed into its place in the wet&#xD;
      milling machine, then the milling preview will be screened to check for any further&#xD;
      adjustment, and finally an order will be given to the milling machine to mill the endocrowns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3rd visit: Participants will be called again for final cementation. Temporary filling will be&#xD;
      removed and abutments will be cleaned of any residues using pumice slurry ***** applied with&#xD;
      bristle brush and rubber cup under water irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper isolation will be done before cementation then permanent resin cement ******will be&#xD;
      used for luting of the endocrowns according to the manufacturer instructions. The patients&#xD;
      will be requested to hold the endocrowns under occlusal compression until luting cement&#xD;
      polymerization. After 5 minutes, excess cement will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring of different outcomes will be in this visit for all patients. 11.b. Criteria for&#xD;
      discontinuing interventions Conditions for discontinuing the prosthetic treatment include&#xD;
      disappearance of the patient with loss of contact or patient's own request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.c. Strategies to improve adherence to intervention protocol: Face-to-Face adherence&#xD;
      reminder session will take place in the initial visit. This session will include: the patient&#xD;
      should be informed about the study steps and maintain oral hygiene. Subsequent sessions will&#xD;
      occur at the follow-up visits. Participants will be asked about any problems they are having&#xD;
      like pain, and oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.d. Relevant concomitant care and interventions that are Permitted or prohibited during the&#xD;
      trial: Motivation and maintenance of oral hygiene measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessment surveys (clinical evaluations) will be carried out for both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1 = immediately after restoration delivery periapical radiograph. T2 = postoperatively:&#xD;
      assessment of the restoration for patient satisfaction. The primary outcomes including&#xD;
      retention, marginal adaptation, anatomic form, secondary caries, and surface texture will be&#xD;
      examined using sharp explorer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes including modified gingival bleeding index and gingival periodontal&#xD;
      index will be assessed and measured using periodontal explorer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the primary as well as the secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline, after 1&#xD;
      month, then after 3 months and finally after 6 months (28) which will be enough for any color&#xD;
      change or soft tissue response to take place.(29) Patients will be asked to give their&#xD;
      restorations a grade out of 10 in order to indicate the level of their satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the grades of all the patients in both groups will be collected (for the alpha, bravo and&#xD;
      Charlie) and the scores for the modified gingival index and the gingival periodontal index&#xD;
      and aggregation will be done for the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the clinical performance outcome, aggregates of all the alpha grades will be grouped as&#xD;
      well as for the bravo and Charlie grades, then a percentage will be calculated for each&#xD;
      grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the soft tissue response outcome, the discrete scores will be gathered and grouped (0-4)&#xD;
      for the modified gingival index and (0-5) for the gingival periodontal index and a percentage&#xD;
      will be calculated for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patient satisfaction outcome, the results will be grouped in five groups (0-2, 3-4,&#xD;
      5-6, 7-8 and 9-10) and a median will be drawn for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13. Participant timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be treated in visits designated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit (1): Preoperative records, signing consents, clinical, radiographic examination&#xD;
           and primary impression for diagnostic cast construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit (2): Teeth preparation, secondary impression and temporary restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit (3): try in&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit (4): Placement and permanent cementation of the final restoration (endocrown) on&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients grouping and allocations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (E.G) will divide participants into two groups each (n=). Regarding restoration type,&#xD;
      allocation will be done using software application and implementation will be carried out by&#xD;
      (E.G) to insure validity of the trial (www.randomizer.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      16.a. Sequence generation (E.G) will allocate participants into two groups with 1:1&#xD;
      allocation ratio by using computerized Sequence generation (www.randomizer.org). Simple&#xD;
      randomization will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      16.b. Allocation concealments: (E.G) will write generated numbers by indispensable pen on&#xD;
      large white paper sheet. The sheet will be folded eight times and saved inside opaque well&#xD;
      sealed envelope in which the inner content cannot be seen by naked eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      16.c. Implementation: Each patient will select one of the envelopes that were previously well&#xD;
      sealed and (A.K) will open the envelopes and assign the patients into the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      17. Blinding: Participants, operator, outcome assessor and statistical analyst will be&#xD;
      blinded to avoid performance, detection and analysis bias. Only (E.G) and (A.K) will be aware&#xD;
      of the allocated patients in each group and the specific type of intervention given to every&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (E.M) will be responsible for all experimental procedures and outcomes assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. C. Methods: data collection, management, and analysis Methods 18. Data collection&#xD;
      methods: (E.M) will assess the outcomes of each group. Primary outcome: the two groups will&#xD;
      be assessed using the modified United States public health service (USPHS) criteria as&#xD;
      follows • Alpha (Excellent) ideal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bravo (Acceptable) less than ideal but no modifications required&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Charlie (Acceptable but modifications needed) staining or other shade modifications&#xD;
           required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: (patient satisfaction) of the two groups will be assessed using the Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS) which is discrete and will be documented in chart including number of&#xD;
      satisfied and unsatisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: soft tissue response will be assessed using Modified Gingival bleeding&#xD;
      index MGI and Gingival Periodontal Index GPI which are discrete scores (0-4 and 0-3&#xD;
      respectively) and will be documented in chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plans to promote participant retention &amp; complete follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone numbers and address of the patient included in the study will be recorded. All&#xD;
      patients will be given a phone call and text message before the next appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      19. Data management: (A.K) will enter all data electronically. Patient files are to be stored&#xD;
      in numerical order in a secured place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20. Statistical methods: All Data will be collected, checked, revised, tabulated and entered&#xD;
      into the computer. Quantitative variables from normal distribution will be expressed as mean&#xD;
      and standard deviation (SD) values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. D. Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      21. Data monitoring The main supervisor is responsible for data monitoring if harms arise;&#xD;
      (lost, deleted) in that case: back up will be asked from (E.M) to provide hard copy for the&#xD;
      requested data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      22. Harms: Unintended adverse effects will be collected, assessed and reported if any&#xD;
      happened.&#xD;
