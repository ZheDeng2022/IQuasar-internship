      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A radioligand is a radioactive substance that is used to diagnose diseases. A new ligand is&#xD;
      called [11C]PS13. This has a small amount of radioactivity that can be detected by a positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) scan. If this ligand works well in this study, researchers may be&#xD;
      able to use it to better understand and diagnose brain disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if [11C]PS13 can measure its receptor, which is involved in inflammation. To see&#xD;
      if researchers get the same results when scanning a person twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18 and older who are in Protocol 01-M-0254.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study requires three visits of 2-5 hours each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 PET scans with [11C]PS13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A needle will guide a small plastic tube (catheter) into an arm vein. The needle will be&#xD;
      removed, leaving only the catheter in the vein. The ligand will be injected through the&#xD;
      catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET scanner is shaped like a doughnut. Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and&#xD;
      out of the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear a molded a plastic mask that fits the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another catheter will be put into an artery at the wrist or elbow area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs will be monitored during the PET scan. Participants will have a test during the&#xD;
      PET scan to monitor heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The MRI scanner is a metal&#xD;
      cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides&#xD;
      in and out of the cylinder.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cyclooxygenase (COX) system is implicated in the pathophysiology of brain diseases,&#xD;
      including Alzheimer s disease and depression, and is a potential biomarker for&#xD;
      neuroinflammation. COX is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandins from&#xD;
      arachidonic acid and exists as two primary isoforms COX-1 and COX-2. Our laboratory recently&#xD;
      developed [(11)C]PS13, a novel PET ligand to selectively image COX-1, and initial PET scans&#xD;
      in monkey demonstrated that [11C]PS13 is a promising ligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two primary objectives. First, we will determine whether the uptake of&#xD;
      [(11)C]PS13 in brain and periphery reflects the distribution of COX-1, as demonstrated by&#xD;
      blocking with a COX-1 preferential drug (aspirin) and no effect with a COX-2 selective drug&#xD;
      (celecoxib). Second, we will measure the test/retest reproducibility of brain uptake&#xD;
      quantified by compartmental modeling and using arterial blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult female and male volunteers (age 18 or older) will have either whole body&#xD;
      imaging (n = 41) or brain imaging (n = 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: We will begin with whole body scanning in a single human subject using up to 10 mCi.&#xD;
      The aim of this first scan will be to detect a tracer that disproportionately accumulates in&#xD;
      a single radiosensitive organ, such as the gonads. If we confirm that radioactivity is fairly&#xD;
      widely distributed in the body, higher activities may be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:Thirty healthy subjects will have three whole body imaging PET scans using 20 mCi of&#xD;
      [11C]PS13. Scan 1 will serve as the baseline scan for comparison to enzyme occupancy studies&#xD;
      and will provide dosimetry information. Scan 2 will be an enzyme occupancy study using the&#xD;
      COX-2 selective antagonist celecoxib. Scan 3 will be an enzyme occupancy study using the&#xD;
      COX-1 preferential antagonist aspirin. Ten healthy subjects will have two whole body imaging&#xD;
      PET scans using 20 mCi of [11C]PS13. Scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 will serve as the baseline scan, and scan 2 will be an enzyme occupancy study using another&#xD;
      potent COX-1 antagonist ketoprofen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: We will perform 15 test retest kinetic brain imaging PET studies with arterial blood&#xD;
      sampling and 5 test retest brain PET studies with both arterial and venous blood sampling,&#xD;
      using a 20 mCi dose of [(11)C]PS13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      For whole body imaging, organ uptake will be quantified as a Standardized Uptake Value (SUV),&#xD;
      which normalizes for injected activity and body weight. Blockade by aspirin and celecoxib&#xD;
      will be expressed as a percentage of the baseline scan in each subject and plotted relative&#xD;
      to the plasma concentration of the drug at time of the PET scan. For dedicated brain imaging,&#xD;
      uptake will be quantified as distribution volume (VT) calculated with compartmental modeling&#xD;
      and serial concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA All phases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit COX-1 and/or COX-2,&#xD;
             subjects should not have taken NSAIDs for two weeks prior to the PET scan. In&#xD;
             addition, aspirin must not have been taken in the prior month, as aspirin irreversibly&#xD;
             inhibits COX.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities based on tests performed under&#xD;
             screening protocol 01-M-0254&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any current Axis I diagnosis, based on interview and self-reporting performed under&#xD;
             screening protocol 01-M-0254.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive HIV test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of medical or neurologic illness or injury with the potential to affect study&#xD;
             data interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent exposure to radiation related to research (i.e. PET from other research) that,&#xD;
             when combined with this study, would be above the allowable limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to lie flat on camera bed for at least two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have substance use disorder or alcohol use disorder. However,&#xD;
             alcohol or cannabis use by themselves are not&#xD;
&#xD;
        exclusion criteria, unless that use impairs function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of psychiatric medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NIMH employees and staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because aspirin and celecoxib require an acidic environment to be absorbed in the&#xD;
             stomach, we will exclude those who have taken proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs, H-2&#xD;
             receptor antagonist drugs, and antacid drugs in the last two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  additional contraindications to taking COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  history of hypersensitivity reaction to COX inhibitors history of aspirin- or&#xD;

               -  history of upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding, gastritis, peptic ulcer&#xD;
                  disease, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  coagulation disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  thrombocytopenia;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  G6PD deficiency;&#xD;

               -  history of gout;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  history of hepatic or renal impairment;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  history of cardiovascular disease or presence of cardiovascular risk factors such&#xD;
