  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the increased focus on education and changing lifestyle, college students are&#xD;
      particularly susceptible to poor overall health and wellness due to inadequate sleep and poor&#xD;
      dietary choices. This is particularly important because the behavioral choices college&#xD;
      students make may affect their risk of chronic disease. This study will research these topics&#xD;
      via an online survey, in person visit and stool sample.&#xD;

      It is important for college students to establish healthy habits during college because they&#xD;
      are likely to stay with them throughout their lives. The transition to college has been&#xD;
      identified as a critical period contributing to the rise in obesity rates. Several studies&#xD;
      have shown that the initial transition to college is associated with rapid weight gain and&#xD;
      the average weight gain in the first year of college ranges from 3.5 to 8.8 pounds. While&#xD;
      decreased dietary fiber, fruits and vegetables and junk food consumption are among the&#xD;
      dietary factors that have been linked to increased obesity rates in college students, little&#xD;
      is known about the effect of eating patterns on health in this population. Furthermore, lack&#xD;
      of sleep, smoking, binge drinking, and infrequent eating are all associated with negative&#xD;
      health outcomes. Previous work with college age youth has found that several behaviors&#xD;
      cluster together. The goal of the Online Survey portion is to expand on current findings, as&#xD;
      well as examine the interrelationships of alcohol use, sleep, smoking, and eating patterns&#xD;
      with adiposity and metabolic disease risk in a population of freshmen college students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eating frequency research has consistently found a negative association between the number of&#xD;
      eating occasions (EOs) per day and adiposity, as well as metabolic disease risk in both youth&#xD;
      and adult populations. Our group has shown that infrequent eating is linked to increased&#xD;
      obesity measures, blunted insulin action, and deleterious lipid parameters in multiple&#xD;
      populations of overweight Hispanic youth (8-18y). However, to date, no group has looked at&#xD;
      the effect of eating frequency on adiposity and metabolic disease risk in a sample of&#xD;
      overweight Hispanic college freshmen. In 2012, for the first time in history Hispanic high&#xD;
      school graduates (69%) were more likely to be enrolled in college than Non-Hispanic Whites&#xD;
      (NHW; 67%) and Blacks (63%) and last year Hispanic students represented 24% of freshman&#xD;
      enrollment at the University of Texas at Austin (UT), Hispanics also showed the largest&#xD;
      increase among all minority groups. Thus, the goal of the In-Person Visit is to examine the&#xD;
      relationship between eating frequency and adiposity/metabolic disease risk in this extremely&#xD;
      high-risk population of Hispanic freshmen and potentially identify interventions that may&#xD;
      reduce this risk within such a crucial period of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human body contains 100 trillion microbes, and microbial genes outnumber human genes&#xD;
      100:110. Over the past decade, interest in the complex ecosystem of gut microbiota has&#xD;
      increased immensely and research has uncovered a relationship between gut microbiota,&#xD;
      metabolic disease, and obesity. Both diet and obesity have been shown to alter the gut&#xD;
      microbiota12,13. However, few studies have investigated how individual dietary components can&#xD;
      affect the gut microbiota in humans. The Stool Sample portion of the study is an exploratory&#xD;
      investigation of the relationship between dietary components and gut microbiota composition&#xD;
      in college-aged Hispanic freshmen.&#xD;
