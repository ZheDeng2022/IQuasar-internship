      For marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) Rituximab in combination with conventional chemotherapy are&#xD;
      widely used for those patients who fail local therapy or do not qualify for such. Depending&#xD;
      on the MZL subtype Rituximab/chemotherapy is able to induce in part long remissions, but do&#xD;
      not prevent relapse later on. In addition, chemotherapy associated toxicity is often&#xD;
      problematic in MZL patients, who are mostly of advanced age. Thus, chemotherapy - free&#xD;
      approaches are highly attractive for this patient group. Rituximab single agent is a widely&#xD;
      used chemotherapy - free approach in MZL, but was significantly inferior compared to&#xD;
      Rituximab/chlorambucil in a large randomized prospective clinical trial in treatment naïve&#xD;
      MZL with a CR rate of 56 % vs. 80%, respectively (P&lt;0.001).Thus, it is the major aim to&#xD;
      develop chemotherapy - free approaches for MZL, which approach efficacy of&#xD;
      rituximab/chemotherapy combinations, but avoid chemotherapy associated toxicities. This in&#xD;
      particular important in MZL as many physicians are reluctant to treat these often elderly&#xD;
      patients with more intense treatments and prefer single agent therapies in these very often&#xD;
      well and long responding lymphoma subtype. The type II anti-CD20 antibody Obinutuzumab&#xD;
      (OBINUTUZUMAB) has demonstrated remarkable activity in follicular lymphoma and superiority to&#xD;
      Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy in treatment naïve (Gallium trial) and rituximab&#xD;
      refractory follicular lymphoma (Gadolin trial) as well as in CLL in combination with&#xD;
      chlorambucil. Based on these observations it is the aim of this study to test the toxicity&#xD;
      and efficacy of the anti-CD20 antibody Obinutuzumab (OBINUTUZUMAB) in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed MZL in need of treatment, who are not eligible or failed local therapy, following&#xD;
      the assumption that this novel anti-CD20 antibody is significantly more effective than&#xD;
      Rituximab single agent therapy, and avoids chemotherapy - related toxicity.&#xD;

      the assumption that this novel anti-CD20 antibody is significantly more effective than&#xD;
      Rituximab single agent therapy, and avoids chemotherapy - related toxicity. For efficacy the&#xD;
      rate of complete remissions (according to the GELA criteria for gastric MALT or to the Cheson&#xD;
      2007 criteria for non-gastric extranodal, nodal and splenic MZL) after induction therapy will&#xD;
      be primarily analysed. For toxicity treatment associated adverse events, quality of life and&#xD;
      cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase II trial of 6 cycles of&#xD;
      Obinutuzumab in the induction phase followed by a maintenance phase for a maximum of 12&#xD;
      infusions of Obinutuzumab every 8 weeks in patients aged ≥ 18 years with previously untreated&#xD;
      MZL in need of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study flow will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously untreated patients will be screened for eligibility for the trial. If the&#xD;
           patient is eligible for the study, the patient will be registered before the first cycle&#xD;
           of induction treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who progress at any time point during induction are considered as treatment&#xD;
           failure. They will be followed up for overall survival until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients, who achieve at least a SD after induction treatment will be eligible to&#xD;
           receive maintenance therapy with Obinutuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that a total of 56 patients at approximately 20 investigator sites will be&#xD;
      registered. Every patient will receive treatment over a time period of 6 x 4 weeks, followed&#xD;
      by a maintenance phase of every 8 weeks for a maximum of 12 infusions until progression or&#xD;
      study drug - related intolerable toxicity. Patient will be monitored every 3 months for 2&#xD;
      additional years, subsequently every 6 months for three additional years.&#xD;
