  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic pancreatic lesions are increasingly detected incidentally in imaging studies,&#xD;
      reportedly in up to 45% of the abdominal Magnetic Resonance (MR) examinations. The majority&#xD;
      of these lesions have potential to become cancer, therefore requiring surgery or imaging&#xD;
      follow-up to monitor the development of features indicative of malignant transformation.&#xD;
      Abdominal MR is the current standard of care for the follow-up of pancreatic cysts (PCs).&#xD;
      However, MR is expensive and access is limited, In our institution, more than 35 MR studies&#xD;
      for assessment of PCs were performed each month in 2015, placing a significant burden on the&#xD;
      health care system that includes contributing to longer MR wait times for other indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare MR to two new computed tomography (CT) techniques - dual&#xD;
      energy CT (DECT) and Subtraction imaging - with regards to their ability to detect features&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of malignancy (enhancing septa and mural nodules) in PCs. For&#xD;
      cases where there is disagreement between these 2 CT techniques and MR, histopathology of the&#xD;
      surgical specimen or the results of Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) will serve as reference&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using DECT or Subtraction instead of MR for the assessment and follow-up of PCs would save&#xD;
      significant healthcare costs and MR slots, which could be released to other indications and&#xD;
      to reduce waiting times. Furthermore, if DECT and/or Subtraction imaging end up demonstrating&#xD;
      to be superior to MR for this purpose, patients with cystic pancreatic lesions could have a&#xD;
      direct benefit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the rapid technological advancement, growth and widespread use of cross-sectional&#xD;
      imaging, there has been increased detection of pancreatic cystic lesions (PCs). The reported&#xD;
      incidence of pancreatic cysts varies widely, with some studies reporting incidental&#xD;
      pancreatic cysts detected in 0.7-2.6 % of asymptomatic adults undergoing imaging. The&#xD;
      incidence reportedly increases with age with a greater than 8% detection rate in those over&#xD;
      age 80 years. The prevalence of a cystic pancreatic lesion in one autopsy series was as high&#xD;
      as 24%. For MRI, the frequency of detection of a pancreatic cyst is significantly higher than&#xD;
      that of CT, with a reported prevalence of 13-45 % for MRI. Consequently, there has been a&#xD;
      significant increased number of MRs ordered for follow-up of these lesions. In our&#xD;
      institution, more than 35 MR studies for assessment of PCs were performed each month in 2015.&#xD;
      This represents greater than 5% of all abdominal/pelvic MR examinations, and this number&#xD;
      appears to be growing. The impact on health care system - particularly on health care costs&#xD;
      as well as MR waiting times for patients with other conditions - is significant. For&#xD;
      instance, in our institution, the average waiting period in 2015 for an outpatient MR&#xD;
      enterography for patients with Crohn's disease is over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, dual energy CT (DECT) has proven to be robust and clinically useful for many&#xD;
      abdominal applications (including solid pancreatic masses). The investigators expect V2R&#xD;
      kVmAS DECT and Subtraction imaging - two promising techniques which have scarcely been&#xD;
      investigated in abdominal disease processes in the literature - to prove to be very useful&#xD;
      for the characterization of pancreatic cysts and to demonstrate comparable diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy compared to MR&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether optimized DECT and/or Subtraction imaging&#xD;
      protocols allow for characterization of cystic pancreatic lesions (in particular, the&#xD;
      presence of enhancing septa and mural nodules) with a diagnostic accuracy equivalent to or&#xD;
      greater than MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-institution study in patients who are being evaluated or&#xD;
      followed for known pancreatic cystic lesions who are planned for a CT and MRI scan. All MRI&#xD;
      scans performed during the study period will be monitored prospectively to identify&#xD;
      consecutive patients undergoing MRI for assessment or follow-up of pancreatic cystic lesions&#xD;
      and meeting the study inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Group 1 includes patients who will undergo surgery for their pancreatic cysts: For these&#xD;
      patients, a pre-operative CT abdomen is routinely performed for surgical planning purposes.&#xD;
      The treating surgeon will contact the study team to arrange for the CT scan - which will&#xD;
      include a DECT scan - to be performed on the appropriate scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Group 2 includes patients who are undergoing surveillance. For these patients, the standard&#xD;
      of care is typically to follow these patients annually with serial MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where findings on MRI are in doubt, a CT scan - which will include a DECT scan -&#xD;
      will be requested as a problem solving tool and part of the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For most patients, a CT scan is not required as part of the standard of care. In these cases,&#xD;
      patients will be recruited and consented for an additional CT scan - which will include a&#xD;
      DECT scan - to be performed within 6 months of their MRI. This CT scan is in addition to the&#xD;
      standard of care. The patient will be recruited at the time of the first follow-up&#xD;
      appointment with their treating surgeon after their MRI scan.&#xD;

    <description>The single source V2R kmAS dual energy CT system has several theoretical advantages compared, such as perfectly matched X-ray paths and the possibility of performing dual-energy processing using projection data.&#xD;
Subtraction imaging is an accurate deformable registration algorithm that allows creation of iodine maps from matched pre- and post-contrast acquisitions. This algorithm can be applied to both single and dual energy CT.</description>
