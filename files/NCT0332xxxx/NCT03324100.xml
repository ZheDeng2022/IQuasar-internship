  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal mucus and nasal epithelium are the first defense barriers against allergens. Various&#xD;
      proteins are found in nasal mucus that play a role in allergic rhinitis and reflect immune&#xD;
      response to allergen exposure. The difference in the proteomic profile of allergic rhinitis&#xD;
      patients and healthy controls can give insight about how the response works and which&#xD;
      proteins could lead to either enhanced immune reaction or to defense response like&#xD;
      augmentation of epithelial integrity. It is also known that the airway epithelium plays a&#xD;
      crucial role in the regulation of airway immune responses and inflammation. Gene expression&#xD;
      profiling is widely used to analyses complex disease. For the airway epithelium gene&#xD;
      expression profile in diseased and healthy state as well as in baseline and provoked state&#xD;
      can clarify the mechanism of defense reactions and the course of inflammatory processes.&#xD;
      Nasal mucus proteins as consequence of different gene expression can be seen as part of the&#xD;
      end products of this complex mechanisms and interactions between allergens and the&#xD;
      epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal mucus proteins have different origins and production sites and gene expression does not&#xD;
      necessarily result in functional metabolites. The aim of this proposed project is to try and&#xD;
      analyze in a holistic proteomic approach the response to allergen on a genetic/genomic level&#xD;
      from the nasal epithelium to protein/proteomic level in nasal mucus. This analysis gives us&#xD;
      insight of how the different gene expression profiles result in a protein expression and&#xD;
      further clarifies which proteins are directly originate from the epithelium and which are&#xD;
      result of plasma exudation or underlie different regulatory processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From allergic rhinitis patients and healthy controls nasal mucus, nasal mucosa, and serum&#xD;
      will be obtained. Nasal mucus will be collected with a special suction device equipped with a&#xD;
      mucus trap from the middle meatus under endoscopic control without touching the mucosa. Nasal&#xD;
      mucosa will be obtained through nasal brushes under local anesthesia and put into primary&#xD;
      culture. Serum prepared from blood samples. Patients with grass or tree pollen allergy will&#xD;
      be included and allergic state will be determined by skin prick tests and RAST&#xD;
      (Radio-Allergo-Sorbent-test). The aimed for sample size will be 15 patients per group.&#xD;
      Samples will be obtained in and out of pollen season. Allergic patients will fill out a&#xD;
      symptom score and samples will be taken when symptoms are strong (in pollen season) and&#xD;
      disappeared (out of pollen season). For healthy controls the time point of sample taking will&#xD;
      be correlated to the allergic rhinitis patients to have a similar pollen exposure. Nasal&#xD;
      mucus will be sent for Liquid Chromatography Tandem mass spectrometry for proteomic analysis&#xD;
      and from nasal epithelial cells RNA will be isolated and send for Microarray analysis. By an&#xD;
      integrative omics approach gene and protein expression will be correlated and cross talk&#xD;
      between nasal mucus and epithelium will be analysed. The identification of key genes or gene&#xD;
      clusters leads to further identification of key proteins or protein groups as biomarkers that&#xD;
      could serve for novel therapeutic or diagnostic strategies in allergic rhinitis. The&#xD;
      integrative omic approach downsizes the potential candidates since the focus lies on&#xD;
      epithelial gene expression and their protein products and excludes proteins that are highly&#xD;
      abundant without direct correlation to allergen exposure e.g. through plasma exudation.&#xD;
      Moreover, the genomic and proteomic analysis could explain in more detail how the barrier of&#xD;
      mucus and epithelium are affected by allergen exposure. The comparison to healthy controls&#xD;
      and the longitudinal changes throughout the season further sheds light on how these&#xD;
      individuals react upon allergen exposure and how this could lead to prevention of&#xD;
      sensitization.&#xD;
