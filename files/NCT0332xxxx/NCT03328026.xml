      This is an open-label study of Study WRI-GEV-007, which evaluates SV-BR-1-GM in metastatic or&#xD;
      locally recurrent breast cancer patients, in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor INCMGA00012&#xD;
      and the IDO inhibitor epacadostat. Patients who with advanced breast cancer who have failed&#xD;
      prior therapies will be eligible to enroll in this study. The study will evaluate SV-BR-1-GM&#xD;
      in combination with INCMGA00012 and epacadostat. Treatment cycles will be every 3 weeks with&#xD;
      evaluations for tumor progression or response every 6-12 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm study of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen in combination with&#xD;
      INCMGA00012 and epacadostat in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer&#xD;
      who have failed at least two lines of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive the SV-BR-1-GM regimen with combination immunotherapy. There will be an&#xD;
      initial evaluation of the combination of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen with INCMGA00012 every 3&#xD;
      weeks. If this is found to be safe and well tolerated in a cohort of at least 6 patients&#xD;
      (dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in less than 30% of the patients evaluated), then a triple&#xD;
      combination of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen with INCMGA00012 and epacadostat will be evaluated in a&#xD;
      cohort of 6 patients. If the DLT rate remains below 30%, additional higher dose levels of&#xD;
      epacadostat will be explored. Once a dose of epacadostat has been determined that is safe and&#xD;
      reliably normalizes plasma kynurenine levels, the study will expand to treat an additional 36&#xD;
      patients. If DLTs are seen in 30% or more of patients, the dose of epacadostat will be&#xD;
      further reduced and an additional cohort of 6 patients evaluated in a stepwise fashion until&#xD;
      a safe dose level is determined. Once the recommended phase II dose is determined, the study&#xD;
      will expand to treat an additional 36 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SV-BR-1-GM regimen consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre- SV-BR-1-GM cyclophosphamide 2-3 days prior to SV-BR-1-GM inoculation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SV-BR-1-GM inoculation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interferon-alpha-2b - at the inoculation sites 2 (±1 day) post-SV-BR-1-GM&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Interferon-alpha-2b - at the inoculation sites 4 (±1 day) post-SV-BR-1-GM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SV-BR-1-GM regimen will be administered with the following combination immunotherapy&#xD;
      regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Combination therapy with INCMGA00012 (anti-PD-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Combination therapy with epacadostat (IDO inhibitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SV-BR-1-GM regimen with INCMGA00012 will be administered every 21 days (± 3 days), except&#xD;
      when approved by the Investigator in consultation with the medical monitor. Epacadostat will&#xD;
      be dosed twice daily and will continue through each cycle. Note that hormonal therapy (e.g.,&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors) is permitted if ongoing, but may be added while the patient is on this&#xD;
      study only with the medical monitor's approval (e.g. for hormone receptor positive patients&#xD;
      who are deriving clinical benefit but have not achieved a CR after &gt;6 cycles of therapy).&#xD;
