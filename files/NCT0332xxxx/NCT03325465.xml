      The KEO study is a single arm phase II trial including 44 patients with T1N1-2B, T2N0-N2B&#xD;
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) eligible for curative-intent resection (+/-&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy), who receive neo-adjvuant pembrolizumab + epacadostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine rate of major treatment effect (MTE) to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant pembrolizumab+epacostat immunotherapy in SCCHN compared to historic data with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant pembrolizumab alone.&#xD;

      The KEO study is a single arm phase II trial including 44 patients with T1N1-2B, T2N0-N2B&#xD;
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) eligible for curative-intent resection (+/-&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy), who receive neo-adjvuant pembrolizumab + epacadostat. Patients that fit&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria (see detailed eligibility criteria below) will receive neoadjuvant&#xD;
      immunotherapy either with anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab) alone or anti-PD-1 in combination with&#xD;
      IDO1 inhibition (epacadostat). Patients will receive 200 mg IV Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 3 doses over a period of 8 weeks as well as oral epacadostat 100 mg BID starting on&#xD;
      day 1 for the duration of pembrolizumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo baseline biopsy (mandatory, sampling ≥ 4 areas to represent the&#xD;
      tumor), as well as baseline imaging (and for exploratory analysis collection of blood for&#xD;
      baseline ctDNA testing and TCR analysis). Patients who are unable to safely (or for other&#xD;
      reasons unwilling to undergo biopsy at baseline and on treatment 3-4 weeks in for infiltrate&#xD;
      assessment are not eligible for the study. MRI is the preferred imaging modality; however,&#xD;
      diagnostic CT is acceptable if patient is unable to undergo MRI or as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently at week 3-4 an interim assessment will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients will undergo imaging with a 2nd MRI scan (or CT, to match prior imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All patients will also undergo repeat mandatory on-treatment biopsy consisting of of 4-6&#xD;
           representative samples to compare to the baseline biopsy. Adequacy of response to&#xD;
           treatment will be assessed in assessing eradication of tumor/presence of antitumor tumor&#xD;
           response (analogous to reports in lung cancer (Forde et al ESMO 2016). The on-treatment&#xD;
           biopsy is essential in the assessment of early response and decision to extend&#xD;
           neo-adjuvant treatment to 8 weeks is based in large part on this biopsy. In patients&#xD;
           where an on-treatment biopsy is not obtained (e.g no longer considered safe or status of&#xD;
           patient has changed), patients will automatically be considered non-complete responders,&#xD;
           and take off study after 4 weeks (with the very unlikely but possible exceptions of&#xD;
           complete response radiologic response at 4 weeks imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For exploratory purposes, blood will also be drawn for repeat ctDNA and TCR analysis in&#xD;
           order to assess potential suitability of dynamic changes ctDNA or TCR&#xD;
           clonality/diversity as candidate biomarkers for follow-up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the week 3/4 interim assessment, results of the imaging and biopsy will be used to&#xD;
      determine response and to determine continuation of immunotherapy induction treatment for up&#xD;
      to 8 weeks (full immunotherapy induction course). Patients that demonstrate stable disease or&#xD;
      tumor shrinkage radiographically and biopsy demonstrating dense lymphocytic infiltrate with&#xD;
      dying tumor / decrease in residual viable tumor will continue on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients with lack of lymphocytic infiltrate/dying tumor or increasing tumor on&#xD;
      radiology (and confirmed on pathology from 2nd biopsy) will be transitioned to standard of&#xD;
      care treatment with early salvage surgery or chemoradiation (as clinically indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-surgery assessment: For those patients continuing - a second confirmatory scan will be&#xD;
      done 3-4 weeks later again coupled with a blood draw, and followed by surgery at/around week&#xD;
      8 (+/-1 week depending on operating schedules).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitive surgery will be done at week 8. Surgical specimens will again be evaluated for&#xD;
      percentage residual viable tumor and inflammatory infiltrate. Patients that exhibit complete&#xD;
      pathologic response (no viable tumor) will follow close observation with repeat imaging&#xD;
      (CT/MRI at 4-6 weeks), clinical exams and a PET scan at 12 weeks post-surgery (as well as&#xD;
      serial ctDNA draws (exploratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with major pathologic responses (≤10% residual tumor, but tumor present) will be&#xD;
      treated with de-escalated adjuvant radiation therapy as determined by the tumor&#xD;
      board/radiation oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a surgical specimen that demonstrates &gt;10% residual tumor after surgery will&#xD;
      undergo standard adjuvant RT/CRT as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant Phase: Patients will continue adjuvant pembrolizumab plus epacadostat every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for 12 months and be monitored with ctDNA and imaging.&#xD;
