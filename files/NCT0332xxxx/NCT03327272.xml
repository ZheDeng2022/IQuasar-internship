  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neural injury is a well-known complication following extreme lateral lumbar interbody fusion&#xD;
      (XLIF). It has been found that up to 9.4% of patients will have either temporary or&#xD;
      persistent neurologic deficit. This occurs with traversal of the psoas muscle or direct&#xD;
      injury to lumbosacral plexus or sympathetic ganglion. While often temporary, it can cause hip&#xD;
      flexor weakness, thigh numbness, or pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated reduced patient reported pain scores following steroid&#xD;
      administration, particularly in the early postoperative period. However, few studies have&#xD;
      investigated the efficacy of intraoperative local injection of corticosteroid in reducing the&#xD;
      incidence and duration of postoperative pain or neurologic injury for XLIF patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the incidence and duration of postoperative pain&#xD;
      is reduced in the subjects receiving a local injection of methylprednisolone when compared to&#xD;
      placebo following XLIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that subjects undergoing XLIF who receive local&#xD;
      methylprednisolone will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduced incidence and duration of postoperative pain and neurologic injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Shorter hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Better short- and long-term outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also aims to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do subjects who receive local corticosteroids have a reduced incidence and duration of&#xD;
           postoperative pain and neurologic deficit compared to those who receive placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do subjects who receive local corticosteroids have a reduced hospital stay compared to&#xD;
           those who received placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is local corticosteroid therapy associated with improved short and long-term outcomes?&#xD;
