  <brief_summary>

      This research study is evaluating the impact of a psychological intervention on the quality&#xD;
      of life and mood of caregivers of patients undergoing stem cell transplant.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether a psychological intervention can make the&#xD;
      experience of being a caregiver more manageable by improving the participant's quality of&#xD;
      life, mood, and caregiving burden during the participant's loved one's transplant process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychological intervention will entail six visits with a trained clinician and will take&#xD;
      place during the first three months of the participant's loved ones' transplant process. A&#xD;
      trained behavioral psychologist or social worker will meet with the participant or talk with&#xD;
      the participant over the telephone or video conference for 45 minutes at a time to discuss&#xD;
      the participant's caregiver experience and to help the participant develop effective skills&#xD;
      to support the participant's loved one as well as participant over the course of the&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a series of questionnaires to measure the participant's quality of life,&#xD;
      mood, and overall caregiving burden. Study questionnaires will be completed in the hospital&#xD;
      or clinic. The participant will also have the option of completing these questionnaires&#xD;
      remotely through a secure web link, over the telephone, or in a mailed paper copy.&#xD;
