      To investigate the predictive value of stathmin expression as a predictive biomarker in OSCC&#xD;

      Induction chemotherapy is regarded as an effective way to reduce or downgrade the locally&#xD;
      advanced or aggressive cancers, and to improve the chance of eradication of the locoregional&#xD;
      lesions by radical surgery and/or radiotherapy. However, there are still debates on the&#xD;
      clinical value of induction chemotherapy for patients with advanced and resectable oral&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma(OSCC). A prospective, open label, parallel, interventional,&#xD;
      randomized control trial on TPF induction chemotherapy indicate there is no difference in&#xD;
      overall survival, disease free survival, local regional recurrence free survival and&#xD;
      metastasis free survival between experimental group and control group (Zhong et al,&#xD;
      Randomized Phase III Trial of Induction Chemotherapy With Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and&#xD;
      Fluorouracil Followed by Surgery Versus Up-Front Surgery in Locally Advanced Resectable Oral&#xD;
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma, J Clin Oncol 2013); however, the subgroup analysis proves that the&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy of TPF protocol could benefit the patients with low stathmin&#xD;
      expression.The previous study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov website with NCT01542931&#xD;
      identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, interventional, randomized control trial was to evaluate the TPF induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy have a better effects in the OSCC patients with low stathmin expression. The&#xD;
      patients would receive TPF induction chemotherapy followed by radical surgery and&#xD;
      post-operative radiotherapy (the experimental group) or radical surgery and post-operative&#xD;
      radiotherapy (the control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study had a power of 80% on the basis of an assumed 5-year survival rate of 93% in the&#xD;
      experiment group and 52% in the control group, with use of a two-sided log-rank test at a&#xD;
      level of significance of 0.05. The recruitment period would be 2 years, and the follow-up&#xD;
      period would be 5 years, and 10% of patients would drop out early or be lost to follow-up. A&#xD;
      total number of 60 patients were to be recruited with stplan 4.5 software calculation.&#xD;
      （Department of Biostatics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas，USA） The patients&#xD;
      in the experimental group received the TPF induction chemotherapy for 2 cycles followed by&#xD;
      radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy. The palpable edges of the&#xD;
      primary lesion (both the longest and shortest axis) were marked before induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      by at least four points, which were 0.5cm away. The patients in the control group received&#xD;
      the radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction chemotherapy: For the patients who were randomly assigned to receive TPF induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy, peripherally inserted central catheter was firstly inserted before intravenous&#xD;
      infusion, docetaxel(at a dose of 75mg/m2 of body surface area) was administered as a 2-hour&#xD;
      intravenous infusion, followed by intravenous cisplatin(75 mg/m2), administered during a&#xD;
      period of 2 to 3 hours. Then, 5-Fu(750 mg/m2/day) was administered as a 120-hour continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion for 5 days. Induction chemotherapy was given every 3 weeks for 2 cycles,&#xD;
      unless there was disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent by&#xD;
      the patients. Dexamethasone was given before docetaxel infusion to prevent docetaxel-related&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxic effects, and fluid retention; prophylactic antibiotics&#xD;
      were also given starting on day 5 of each cycle for 3 days. Hydration with diuretic and&#xD;
      antiemetic treatment was also performed. Primary prophylaxis with recombinant granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor was not suggested. Chemotherapy dose reductions were allowed for&#xD;
      grade 3/4 toxicities occurring after cycle 1: 25% and 50% dose reductions of the three&#xD;
      chemotherapy agents were suggested for grade 3 and grade 4 hematologic toxicities or&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicities, respectively; 25% and 50% cisplatin dose reductions were&#xD;
      suggested for grade 3 and grade 4 renal toxicities, respectively. Surgery was performed at&#xD;
      least 2 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery: Radical resection of the primary lesion and full neck dissection(functional or&#xD;
      radical) with proper reconstruction(pedicle or free flap) were performed. The safety margins&#xD;
      of the primary lesion were 1.0-1.5cm far away from the palpable margins of the lesion; for&#xD;
      patients who received induction chemotherapy, the safety margins were 1.0cm away from the&#xD;
      marks that were placed before induction chemotherapy, to ensure the same extent surgery in&#xD;
      both arms. Frozen sections during surgery were performed to confirm adequate margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative radiotherapy: Radiotherapy was arranged 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Routine&#xD;
      external beam radiotherapy, such as conformal or intensity modulated radiotherapy was&#xD;
      performed, and the dose was 1.8-2 Gy/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks, and totally 54-60 Gy, in&#xD;
      the patient with high risk features, such as positive surgical margin, extra capsular nodal&#xD;
      spread, vascular embolism, concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin of 80mg/m2 was suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete medical history was obtained and tumor assessment was performed at baseline.&#xD;
      Clinical tumor response was assessed by clinical evaluation and imaging study and was&#xD;
      characterized according to the criteria of response evaluation criteria in solid tumors&#xD;
      (version 1.1) before surgery. Post-operative pathologic response was assessed by&#xD;
      post-operative pathologic examination as good and bad response. A good response was defined&#xD;
      as absence of any tumor cells (pathologic complete response) or presence of scattered foci of&#xD;
      a few tumor cells (minimal residual disease with &lt;10% viable tumor cells); otherwise, a bad&#xD;
      pathologic response was defined. Toxic effects were assessed weekly during and after&#xD;
      completion of induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy according to the common terminology&#xD;
      criteria for adverse events (version 3.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death; disease&#xD;
      free survival was calculated from the date of randomization to tumor recurrence or distant&#xD;
      metastasis or death from any cause; locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis free survival&#xD;
      was calculated from the date of randomization to locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis&#xD;
      of tumor or death from any cause. Time to locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis was&#xD;
      calculated from the date of finishing treatment to tumor locoregional recurrence/distant&#xD;
      metastasis. Patients were monitored by every three months in the first two years, every six&#xD;
      months in the next 2 years, and once a year thereafter until death or data censoring&#xD;
