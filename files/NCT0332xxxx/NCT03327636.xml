  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is a common tumor in Hong Kong. Early immediate&#xD;
      surgery has traditionally been recommended. However, given its excellent prognosis, some have&#xD;
      recommended Active Surveillance (AS) as an alternative. AS involves monitoring the patients&#xD;
      who have PTMC until the tumor progresses. On the other hand, a new technology of ablation has&#xD;
      been developing to be an alternative treatment for thyroid nodules comparing with traditional&#xD;
      surgery, named High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). In our previous study, HIFU is&#xD;
      proved in shrinking the size of target site by 6 months gradually and effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesize that HIFU is an effective treatment for PTMC. Compared to AS,&#xD;
      HIFU may be a better option as it not only halts disease progression but also has a longer&#xD;
      progression-free survival, longer time to tumor progression and is less likely to harbor&#xD;
      active disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Differentiated thyroid cancer has been rising in incidence and is expected to be a leading&#xD;
      cancer by the year 2030 . However, the rise has been mostly attributed to an increased&#xD;
      detection of incidentally-discovered papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). PTMC is a&#xD;
      papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) measuring ≤ 10mm in its greatest dimension. Previous&#xD;
      screening and autopsy studies have confirmed these lesions are common and could be found in&#xD;
      up to 15% of normal healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, since the incidence of clinically-significant PTC has historically been &lt;0.5% (i.e.&#xD;
      100 times less than the occult rate), most occult PTMCs probably do not cause harm in one's&#xD;
      life-time and could be safely observed without immediate surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, several groups of investigators worldwide began evaluating the feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of observing PTMC without surgery. Rather than offering immediate surgery, well&#xD;
      selected patients with low-risk PTMC (i.e. no extrathyroidal extension, nodal and distant&#xD;
      metastases) were followed with regular ultrasound (USG) alone and only proceeded to&#xD;
      definitive to surgery when the PTMC showed progression. As expected, &gt;90% PTMCs did not&#xD;
      progress and of those who progressed and had surgery, all were cured. This meant even when&#xD;
      the initial surgery was deferred, there was no compromise in the chance of cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a recent shift towards a more conservative approach in the management of PTC, it has&#xD;
      become increasingly accepted that perhaps active surveillance (AS) might be a safe&#xD;
      alternative in well selected low-risk PTMCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the fact that AS is a viable alternative, there are issues and challenges.&#xD;
      First, although the majority of occult tumors do not progress initially, the accumulative&#xD;
      risk of tumor progression increases with time. From an analysis of the 1479 PTMCs observed&#xD;
      over 5 years, 212 (14.3%) eventually met the progression criteria (such as tumor enlargement,&#xD;
      local invasion, new lymph node metastasis or becoming clinical disease) and had surgery.&#xD;
      Therefore, with longer observation, a greater proportion of patients would end up having&#xD;
      surgery. Second some patients tend to find it difficult to accept AS as a treatment. Even if&#xD;
      they do initially, the &quot;wait and see&quot; approach may distress patients leading to&#xD;
      non-compliance. To date, little is known how this may affect patients' well-being and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) over time. Third, since there are no clinical or&#xD;
      molecular parameters to predict which tumors are more likely to progress, patients often need&#xD;
      life-long follow-up. However, this may be challenging because patients may move to different&#xD;
      places. Lastly, there are now less invasive, non-surgical options available to potentially&#xD;
      eradicate PTMCs. Image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA) using laser ablation or radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation appears promising. With technological advances, they may eventually replace surgery&#xD;
      in the future. However, reports have so far been non-randomized, uncontrolled and short&#xD;
      follow-up. Furthermore, despite being less-invasive, they still require a small skin&#xD;
      incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a form of IGTA that needs no skin incision or&#xD;
      needle insertion and so, is a truly noninvasive treatment. Under USG guidance, it is able to&#xD;
      cause irreversible tissue destruction deep to the skin and subcutaneous layer. Apart from&#xD;
      being non-invasive, it is less dependent on the operator's skill as the treatment could be&#xD;
      controlled by an automated program. In fact, HIFU is highly successful in a number of solid&#xD;
      cancers. In the thyroid, it induces tissue damage via the cavitation and thermal effects. To&#xD;
      date, several groups (including us) have confirmed that HIFU ablation is highly effective in&#xD;
      inducing shrinkage of benign thyroid nodules.&#xD;

             PTC (Bethesda class VI cytology) or suspicious of PTC (Bethesda V cytology). For the&#xD;
             latter, the nodule needs to have an additional suspicious sonographic feature (i.e.&#xD;
             marked hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, height-to-wide ratio &gt;1 and intravascular&#xD;
             microcalcifications);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not expressed a strong desire for immediate surgery after PTMC has been&#xD;
             confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≤ 18 or ≥ 75 years old;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have another thyroid nodule that is either indeterminate or malignant on FNAC;&#xD;

             and/or free thyroxine levels outside the normal ranges)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have sonographic evidence of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (because this generally&#xD;
             makes it difficult to assess and reassess tumor size accurately on USG alone)&#xD;

             extension, concomitant nodal or distant metastasis or a PTMC located within 3mm from&#xD;
             trachea-esophageal groove or recurrent laryngeal nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a condition considered not suitable for HIFU treatment (pregnancy, history of&#xD;
             neck irradiation, known contralateral vocal cord palsy, a tumor with coarse,&#xD;
             macroscopic intranodular calcifications or located outside the treatable depth of 5-30&#xD;
             mm from the skin, family history of non-medullary thyroid carcinoma and medical&#xD;
