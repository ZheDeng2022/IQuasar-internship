  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) has a relatively high incidence of 41 per 100,000/year in&#xD;
      Denmark. In spite of that, there is no regional or national consensus on treatment of PTA.&#xD;
      Abscess drainage can be done by aspiration, incision or acute tonsillectomy. Several studies&#xD;
      show that incision and aspiration are equally successful. The aim for this study is to&#xD;
      compare aspiration to acute tonsillectomy (tonsillectomy a chaud) in a RCT study regarding&#xD;
      sick-leave days, days of admission, pain, consumption of antibiotics, consumption of&#xD;
      painkillers and patientsÂ´ self-assessed quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a complication of acute tonsillitis. The condition&#xD;
      occurs when the infection spreads from the tonsil to the peritonsillar tissue, resulting in&#xD;
      accumulation of pus between the tonsil and the muscles of the throat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTA is a common condition with an incidence of 41 per 100.000/year in Denmark. Untreated, PTA&#xD;
      may develop into a potentially fatal condition with respiratory problems due to para- or&#xD;
      retrofaryngeal abscess or spread of infection to surrounding tissue with necrotizing&#xD;
      fasciitis, sepsis and thrombophlebitis of the jugular vein (Lemierres syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of the high incidence of PTA, there is no regional or national consensus on the&#xD;
      treatment of the PTA. There are several methods used for the treating of PTA. Draining of the&#xD;
      abscess can be done by puncture and aspiration, incision or immediate abscess tonsillectomy&#xD;
      (tonsillectomy a chaud). Additional treatment may consist of antibiotics, analgesics and&#xD;
      rehydration. Depending on the general condition patients are either hospitalized for&#xD;
      treatment or receive outpatient treatment (aspiration or incision).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute surgical intervention (tonsillectomy a chaud) is relevant in children, adults who&#xD;
      cannot cooperate to aspiration, if malignancy is suspected in the patient, patients who&#xD;
      experience insufficient effect from treatment with aspiration and antibiotics, patients with&#xD;
      recurrent PTA or history of recurrent tonsillitis. Based on these criteria, a previous&#xD;
      published article reported a relative indication for immediate abscess tonsillectomy in&#xD;
      approximately 30% of patients with PTA. The advantage of surgery is that the abscess cavity&#xD;
      cannot reform and that, in many cases, antibiotic treatment may be discontinued after the&#xD;
      operation. The risk of surgery is primarily post-operative hemorrhage. The hemorrhage rate&#xD;
      after immediate abscess tonsillectomy is not significantly higher compared to elective&#xD;
      tonsillectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative treatment options are puncture and aspiration of pus or incision and dilatation.&#xD;
      Benefits of these treatments are that the patient usually can be treated in outpatient&#xD;
      clinics, and avoid surgery in general anesthesia. Good patient compliance is required as well&#xD;
      as concomitant antibiotic treatment. Incision treatment has not been found more successful&#xD;
      compared to aspiration treatment (NNT=48).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have compared immediate abscess tonsillectomy to puncture and aspiration and&#xD;
      reported high success rates (82-95%) for aspiration. However, the risk of aspiration or&#xD;
      incision is that the PTA will reform, necessitating subsequent tonsillectomy. The PTA&#xD;
      reformation risk is highest in patients with a history of recurrent tonsillitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study including 53 patients hospitalized with PTA, has reported significantly&#xD;
      shorter hospital stay for patients treated with tonsillectomy compared to aspiration, but no&#xD;
      randomized studies have been conducted investigating differences in duration of hospital stay&#xD;
      or days absent from work between treatments. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies&#xD;
      investigating patient reported outcomes such af quality of life and satisfactionwith&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of tonsillectomy a chaud versus needle&#xD;
      aspiration for PTA. The primary outcome is number of sick-leave days and days spent in&#xD;
      hospital. Secondary outcomes include consumption of antibiotics, consumption of painkillers,&#xD;
      VAS score and patients' self-assessed quality of life in relation to treatment. The results&#xD;
      of the study will improve information and advice given to patients with PTA as well as aid&#xD;
      clinicians in choosing the best treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods The study is designed as a prospective randomized non-blinded&#xD;
      controlled multicenter trial. Patients will be enrolled from Departments of ENT-HNS in&#xD;
      Southern Denmark. Inclusion criteria are adult patients (age 18 years or older) with PTA.&#xD;
      Patients with respiratory distress, suspected malignancy, previous PTA, deep neck infection&#xD;
      or history of recurrent tonsillitis and patients with poor compliance to aspiration will be&#xD;
      excluded. Criteria are chosen based on current clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTA is defined by presence of pus, confirmed by 3-point aspiration. Aspiration can be&#xD;
      performed under local anesthesia with xylocaine spray or injection of local anesthetic.&#xD;
      Puncture and aspiration will be done from three predefined points. The patient is eligible&#xD;
      for inclusion in the presence of pus and is randomized to either needle aspiration or&#xD;
      tonsillectomy a chaud.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated with aspiration will receive standard antibiotic treatment according to&#xD;
      clinical guidelines: Penicillin and metronidazole or Clindamycin alone in case of penicillin&#xD;
      allergy. These patients will be treated in the outpatient clinic and will be examined again&#xD;
      the day after inclusion. Aspiration will be done if necessary. At this first control visit&#xD;
      the clinician will schedule the next visit based on findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated with tonsillectomy a chaud are admitted for intra-venous treatment with&#xD;
      penicillin and metronidazole until surgery. Antibiotic treatment is discontinued after&#xD;
      surgery and the patient may be discharged from the hospital the day after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected regarding gender, age, history of tonsillitis (number of sore throats&#xD;
      per year over the past 3 years) and regarding predefined outcomes: duration of hospital stay,&#xD;
      duration of sick leave, use of antibiotics, VAS score and use of painkillers. The patient is&#xD;
      also asked to indicate when he feels well again and free from disease. Quality of life will&#xD;
      be measured using the Glasgow benefit Inventory which is validated for use in ENT-surgery. In&#xD;
      addition, in the tonsillectomy group data regarding the number of episodes postoperative&#xD;
      bleeding and readmissions will be collected and in the aspiration group data regarding the&#xD;
      number of aspirations (outpatient controls) and number of rescue tonsillectomies due to&#xD;
      failure of aspiration treatment will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be follow-up after 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 3 months using online&#xD;
      surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has been approved by the The Regional Committees on Health Research Ethics for&#xD;
      Southern Denmark and The Danish Data Protection Agency. Data is stored in SharePoint or&#xD;
      RedCap and analyzed in STATA. Randomization was done by Sealed Envelope Ldt. 2017&#xD;
      (https://sealedenvelope.com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists [Accessed 6 Oct 2017]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will receive written information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Power calculation Power calculation was done in order to estimate the minimum number of&#xD;
      patients to be included in the study. A default value of 0.80 was chosen. Calculations are&#xD;
      based on the assumption of the minimum relevant clinical difference between the two types of&#xD;
      treatment in terms of number of days of sick leave. Patients will be randomized in two groups&#xD;
      of equal size. Based on similar studies the investigators expect normal/parametric&#xD;
      distribution of the data with standard deviation of 6 and mean difference of 3 between the&#xD;
      two groups. Based on these assumptions a minimum of 64 patients should be included in each&#xD;
      group to reject the null hypothesis (that there is no difference in the number of sick leave&#xD;
      days). Significance level is set at 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Statistics In case of normal distribution unpaired t-test will be applied. Non-parametric&#xD;
      tests will be applied if data is non-normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life data will be analyzed according to recommendations by the developers of the&#xD;
      applied instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects Both treatment options included in the study are well established and used in&#xD;
      current treatment of PTA. Patients fulfilling any of the exclusion criteria will be offered&#xD;
      tonsillectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained from all patients after oral and written information about&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact on the daily function in the ENT departments Patients with PTA are usually referred to&#xD;
      the ENT department from general practitioners, ENT doctors in private clinics, emergency&#xD;
      departments etc. A smaller proportion is treated in ENT private clinics if the general&#xD;
      condition of the patient is good. Therefore, ENT doctors in private clinics will be asked to&#xD;
      refer all patients with PTA to hospital departments for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will not interfere significantly with daily functions in the departments. However,&#xD;
      at first visit the clinician will inform patients orally and hand out written information on&#xD;
      the study as well as obtain written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economy Funding may be applied for in relevant research Foundations e.g. OUH's Research&#xD;
      Group, Independent research, Consultant Council at OUH and Maersk Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives The investigators expect to include a total of 128 patients divided into two&#xD;
      groups during a period of 12 months. The number of included patients from the different&#xD;
      departments will vary according to size and activity level. The investigators hope to obtain&#xD;
      enough evidence for a clinical guideline on the treatment of PTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results are expected to be published in an international journal.&#xD;
