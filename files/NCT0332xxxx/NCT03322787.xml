  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current literature clearly shows the benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation in symptomatic COPD&#xD;
      (Trooster,2005). However, these patients are frequently unable to sustain a work-load&#xD;
      sufficiently high to obtain a full benefit on exercise tolerance (Trooster,2005). Especially&#xD;
      in patients with Chronic Respiratory Failure (CRF), the development of hypoxia&#xD;
      (O'Donnel,2001) and the increase of dead space (Elbehairy,2015) during effort explain the&#xD;
      out-of-proportion increase in ventilation leading to an early achievement of the ventilatory&#xD;
      reserve. Recent studies on heated and humidified high flow oxygen (HFO) delivered through&#xD;
      nasal cannula, show several positive effects on breathing pattern and ventilatory efficiency,&#xD;
      mostly in critical care setting and at rest (Spoletini,2015). Some recent physiological&#xD;
      studies have evidenced that high flows of humidified oxygen improve exercise performance in&#xD;
      patients with COPD and severe oxygen dependency, in part by enhancing oxygenation&#xD;
      (Chatila,2004). Recently, a pilot study by our group showed that HFO may improve the exercise&#xD;
      performance in severe COPD patients with ventilatory limitation. This effect is associated to&#xD;
      an improvement of oxygen saturation (SatO2) and perceived symptoms at iso-time (Cirio,2016).&#xD;
      No clinical studies are available about the use of HFO during exercise training. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that, in severe COPD patients with CRF and exercise limitation ,&#xD;
      the use of HFO could improve the efficiency of ventilation, leading to an increase in the&#xD;
      patient's exercise performance and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim will be to evaluate in patients COPD with CRF the difference in the endurance&#xD;
      tolerance improvement (expressed in minutes) after an high intensity training program, at&#xD;
      iso-FiO2, using HFO with respect to usual oxygen administration by &quot; Venturi Mask&quot; .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be to study effectiveness of HFO with respect to &quot;Venturi Mask&quot; in&#xD;
      terms of improvement of meters of 6 Minute Walking Test, dyspnea at rest, peripheral and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength,blood gases, motor and respiratory disability,quality of&#xD;
      life,impact of the disease and patients satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      160 patients will be enrolled in 4 different hospitals. One of those, ICS Maugeri, will&#xD;
      contribute with 5 different Institutes [Brescia, Pavia, Tradate (VA),Veruno (NO) and Cassano&#xD;
      delle Murge (BA)]. Thus the total recruiting centers will be eight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the whole rehabilitation period, the patients will perform one training session/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will use medications and oxygen therapy at rest as prescribed. The patients will&#xD;
      perform no less than 20 training sessions within a period of one month. The rehabilitative&#xD;
      intervention will be constantly supervised by a respiratory therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cycle load started from the 50% of the theoretical maximum watt (evaluated by 6 minutes&#xD;
      walking test [6MWT] through the Luxton's equation) (Luxton,2008) and increased by Maltais's&#xD;
      protocol (Maltais,1997). Run-in training session: all patients will be submitted to a&#xD;
      preliminary 30 minute training under a Venturi mask to set the FiO2 able to maintain SpO2&#xD;
      constantly up to 93%. Usual nocturnal ventilation and nocturnal oxygen therapy under nasal&#xD;
      cannula will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OXYGEN (Control Group, n = 80): the training will be performed using the Venturi mask&#xD;
           with the FiO2 set during the run -in session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HFO (TREATMENT Group, n = 80): the training will be performed using the HFO device.&#xD;
           Air-flow will be set at the highest value tolerated by the patient, until a maximum&#xD;
           value of 60 l/min and with the same FiO2 set of the Control Group (iso-FiO2) during the&#xD;
           run-in session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HFO will be administered using the AIRVO2® (Fisher&amp;Paykel- NewZealand, CE0123 -&#xD;
      93/42/CEE). Afterwards, the oxygen flow provided into the system will be progressively&#xD;
      increased until the pre-fixed FiO2 will be reached, as displayed by the AIRVO2 monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators will expect an enrollmnet rate of at least 23 patients/center. An&#xD;
      enrollment rate less than 12 patients/center will not guarantee 1 author name on the possible&#xD;
      Scientific publication. All the centers will be named in a possible congress/poster&#xD;
      presentation. The possible publication will consider that a) the study is under the&#xD;
      endorsement of AIPO and ARIR societies and b) Authors acknowledge the Industry contribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (T0), for both groups the following clinical evaluations will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric (age, BMI, diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scale of comorbidity (CIRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry (FEV1 %prd, FVC %prd, FEV1/FVC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (T0) and at the end of rehabilitative program (T1), an operator, unblinded to the&#xD;
      study, will perform the following outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Constant load cycle-ergometer endurance [at work load of 80% of maximal load predicted&#xD;
           by Luxon's equation (Luxton,2008)] under usual oxygen supply with nasal cannula&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) under room air&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-min walking test (6MWT) under usual oxygen supply with nasal cannula&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scale of the MRC dyspnea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life (MRF26 scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory muscle strength (MIP and MEP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biceps and Quadriceps muscle strength tested by manual dynamometer and MRC muscle scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disability (Barthel index, Barthel dispnea)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of the disease (CAT scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each training session the investigators will evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects (discomfort, severe dyspnea, dryness of mucosa , etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  delta increase in training prescription (% of variation in watts compared with the&#xD;
           previous session)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only at the end of the program (T1) the investigators will evaluate :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patient satisfaction for training sessions with a Likert scale (0= no discomfort; 1&#xD;
           minimum discomfort; 2= moderate discomfort; 3 = high discomfort; 4= maximum discomfort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. drops out (number and reasons: exacerbation, intolerance of treatment, refuse, early&#xD;
           discharge, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using STATA 12. Descriptive data will be shown as mean&#xD;
      ± SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will be conducted on a intention-to-treat (all randomized patients) or&#xD;
      per-protocol (all completers) basis. A two-sample t test was used to explore differences in:&#xD;
      1. baseline characteristics intervention and control groups, 2. between improvers and non&#xD;
      improvers, 3.between completers and 4. dropouts and to assess differences in changes of&#xD;
      parameters following the rehabilitation program between intervention and control groups.&#xD;
      Wilcoxon matched-paired tests and Mann-Whitney U test will be employed for nonparametric&#xD;
      data. Frequency distributions will be analyzed with χ2 test. Data will be considered&#xD;
      significant for p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample estimated size for two sample comparison of means on primary outcome (endurance&#xD;
      time evaluated by cicloergometer at costant load) (alpha error 0.05, beta error=0.90&#xD;
      considering mean control group=150 s, mean treatment group=280s, standard deviation for both&#xD;
      groups 250s ) is 156 patients&#xD;
