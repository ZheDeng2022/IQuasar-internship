    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-site study to collect safety and efficacy data on&#xD;
      an intraoperative imaging system, the LUM Imaging System (LUM015 imaging agent in conjunction&#xD;
      with the LUM imaging device), in identifying residual cancer in the tumor bed of female&#xD;
      breast cancer patients. During the study, study physicians and clinical staff will complete&#xD;
      hands-on training in anticipation of the upcoming pivotal study. Site-specific or&#xD;
      user-specific issues related to the use of the device will be identified and addressed.&#xD;
      Additionally, the data collected in the study will be used to continue training the tumor&#xD;
      detection algorithm of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will be injected with LUM015 prior to surgery. The study physicians&#xD;
      will perform lumpectomy procedures according to his or her institution's standard of care&#xD;
      practice. After the main specimen removal is completed, the study physician will use the LUM&#xD;
      Imaging Device to image the tumor bed. Therapeutic shaves will be removed based on the&#xD;
      recommendation of the LUM Imaging System. Patients will be followed until their first&#xD;
      standard of care post-operative follow-up visit.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For breast cancer lumpectomies, the presence of residual cancer cells left in the tumor bed&#xD;
      after initial resection in inferred by post-operative margin assessment of the resected&#xD;
      tissue by a pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase C enrollment will include approximately 5 patients per surgeon, with 2-3 surgeons per&#xD;
      site and up to 20 sites. Subjects undergoing a lumpectomy procedure to treat primary breast&#xD;
      cancer will be injected with a single dose of LUM015 4 ± 2 hours prior to surgery at a dose&#xD;
      of 1.0 mg/kg. The sequence of events during the surgical procedure will vary based on the&#xD;
      standard of care used by the surgeon. Patients will receive at a minimum the standard of care&#xD;
      practices for each site. Lumicell-guided shaved cavity margins will be removed after the&#xD;
      surgeon has attempted to remove the main specimen with grossly negative margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed. All patients will continue their&#xD;
      enrollment in the study until their first follow-up visit and they will continue to be&#xD;
      followed until the medical team determines no further surgical intervention is required.&#xD;
      Patients with adverse events that are determined to be possibly related to the LUM Imaging&#xD;
      System will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed primary invasive breast&#xD;
             cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or a combination of invasive breast cancer and&#xD;
             DCIS. The protocol accepted methods for obtaining the histological samples are&#xD;
             diagnostic core needle biopsies or fine needle biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female, age of 18 years or older. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of LUM015 in subjects &lt;18 years of age, children are&#xD;
             excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be scheduled for a lumpectomy for a breast malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have received and signed an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have no uncontrolled serious medical problems except for the diagnosis&#xD;
             of cancer, as per the exclusion criteria listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function within limits as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt; 75,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects&#xD;
                  with creatinine levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are treated for bilateral breast cancer resection procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant at the time of diagnosis of their breast cancer; this&#xD;
             exclusion is necessary because the teratogenic properties of LUM015 are unknown.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with LUM015, breastfeeding should be discontinued&#xD;
             if the mother is treated with LUM015.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable&#xD;
             forms of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) upon&#xD;
             entering the study and for 60 days after injection of LUM015. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately. Breast cancer patients are routinely&#xD;
             advised against becoming pregnant during treatment, so this requirement does not&#xD;
             differ from standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have taken an investigational drug within 30 days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with prolonged QTc interval defined as greater than 480 ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who will have administration of methylene blue or any dye for sentinel lymph&#xD;
             node mapping on the day of the surgery prior to imaging the lumpectomy cavity with the&#xD;
             LUM Imaging Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have not recovered from adverse events due to other pharmaceutical or&#xD;
             diagnostic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension defined as persistent systolic blood pressure&#xD;
             &gt; 180 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg; those subjects with known HTN&#xD;
             should be stable within these ranges while under pharmaceutical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reaction attributed to drugs containing polyethylene glycol (PEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reaction to any oral or intravenous contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, COPD or asthma requiring hospitalization within the past 12 months, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with LUM015.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any subject for whom the investigator feels participation is not in the best interest&#xD;
             of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects undergoing a second lumpectomy procedure because of positive margins in a&#xD;
             previous surgery prior to entering this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with prior ipsilateral breast cancer surgeries, mastectomies, breast&#xD;
             reconstructions or implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have undergone a surgical biopsy for any reason in the ipsilateral breast&#xD;
             performed less than 2 years prior to enrollment of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with prior ipsilateral reduction mammoplasties (breast reductions) performed&#xD;
             less than 2 years prior to enrollment to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects previously treated with systemic therapies to treat the cancer to be removed&#xD;
             during this clinical investigation, such as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects undergoing breast conserving surgery whose resected specimen will be&#xD;
             evaluated with frozen section.&#xD;
