    <textblock>
      Compared to dialysis, kidney transplantation is associated with improved survival, better&#xD;
      quality of life and substantial cost savings to healthcare systems. Despite these advantages,&#xD;
      many individuals with kidney failure will never receive a kidney transplant. A&#xD;
      multi-component quality improvement intervention (vs. usual care) provided in chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) programs located in Ontario, Canada was developed to determine if it can enable&#xD;
      more patients with no recorded contraindications to kidney transplant to complete more steps&#xD;
      towards receiving a kidney transplant. These CKD programs provide care to individuals with&#xD;
      CKD (including patients approaching the need for dialysis and patients receiving dialysis).&#xD;
      The intervention has four main components: (1) local quality improvement teams and&#xD;
      administrative support; (2) tailored education and resources for staff, patients, and living&#xD;
      kidney donor candidates; (3) support from kidney transplant recipients and living kidney&#xD;
      donors (i.e. Transplant Ambassador Program); and (4) program-level performance reports and&#xD;
      oversight by program leaders. The Enhance Access to Kidney Transplantation and Living Kidney&#xD;
      Donation (EnAKT LKD) trial will provide high-quality evidence on whether a multi-component&#xD;
      quality improvement intervention helps patients complete more steps towards receiving a&#xD;
      kidney transplant.&#xD;

      1. Statement of the health problem or issue: Compared with dialysis, a kidney transplant&#xD;
           offers patients a better quality of life and many gain 10 or more years of life&#xD;
           expectancy. A transplant also costs the healthcare system less-over a five-year period.&#xD;
           Living donor transplants offer further advantages, including superior graft and patient&#xD;
           survival compared with deceased donor transplants. Unfortunately, many patients with&#xD;
           kidney failure who would benefit from a transplant will never receive one. There is a&#xD;
           chronic shortage of organs from deceased donors, and in Canada, the rate of living donor&#xD;
           kidney transplantation has stagnated. In addition to the shortage of transplantable&#xD;
           kidneys, several other barriers impede patient access to transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective of your project: To determine if a quality improvement intervention provided&#xD;
           in chronic kidney disease (CKD) programs (vs. usual care) enables more patients with no&#xD;
           recorded contraindications to kidney transplant to complete more steps towards receiving&#xD;
           a kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How will you undertake your work? We will conduct a pragmatic two-arm, parallel-group,&#xD;
           open-label, registry-based, cluster-randomized clinical trial-the Enhance Access to&#xD;
           Kidney Transplantation and Living Kidney Donation (EnAKT LKD) trial. Our study will&#xD;
           include the 26 chronic kidney disease (CKD) programs in Ontario, Canada which are&#xD;
           expected to care for over 10,000 adult patients with CKD (including patients approaching&#xD;
           the need for dialysis and patients receiving dialysis) with no recorded&#xD;
           contraindications to a kidney transplant during the trial. Patients in 13 of the 26 CKD&#xD;
           programs will receive a quality improvement intervention or usual care. The intervention&#xD;
           has four main components: (1) local quality improvement teams and administrative&#xD;
           support; (2) tailored education and resources for staff, patients, and living kidney&#xD;
           donor candidates; (3) support from kidney transplant recipients and living kidney&#xD;
           donors; and (4) program-level performance reports and oversight by program leaders.&#xD;
           Patients in the other 13 programs will receive usual care and will continue to support&#xD;
           access to kidney transplantation and living kidney donation as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is unique/innovative about your project? An investigator usually needs to study a&#xD;
           large number of patients in a clinical trial to reliably understand the effects of a&#xD;
           treatment. Normally, a study with 10,000 patients would cost more than $10 million&#xD;
           dollars to conduct; however, this study will provide a reliable answer to the question&#xD;
           being asked and can be done at a fraction of the cost. This is because we will use data&#xD;
           already collected by the healthcare system. The investigator will be able to analyze&#xD;
           these healthcare data at the end of the study. This means that the study will cost less&#xD;
           than a traditional clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This pragmatic trial includes all CKD programs in the province of Ontario. By including&#xD;
           patients from a variety of backgrounds, the results of the trial should be broadly&#xD;
           generalizable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the impact of the proposed research? The EnAKT LKD trial will provide&#xD;
           high-quality evidence on whether a multi-component quality improvement intervention&#xD;
           helps patients complete more steps towards receiving a kidney transplant. This is&#xD;
           important as compared to dialysis, kidney transplant offers patients a better quality of&#xD;
           life and many gain 10 or more years of life expectancy. A transplant also costs the&#xD;
           healthcare system less. If our intervention is successful, more transplants may&#xD;
           ultimately be performed and result in improved survival and a better quality of life for&#xD;
           patients with CKD. Kidney transplantation achieves the triple aim in healthcare: better&#xD;
           outcomes, better experience of care, and lower costs.&#xD;

    <description>The average number of key steps completed towards receiving a kidney transplant per 100 person-years during the trial period and analyzed at the cluster-level (chronic kidney disease program). Each step will only be counted once per patient (the first time it occurs), and each patient can contribute a maximum of four steps to their group total. The four steps include: Step I: patient referred to a transplant centre for evaluation, Step II: at least one living kidney donor candidate contacts a transplant centre for an intended recipient and completes a health history questionnaire to begin their evaluation, Step III: patient added to the deceased donor transplant wait list, and Step IV: patient receives a kidney transplant from a living or deceased donor. Patients who complete steps before the trial starts can contribute new steps during the trial period.</description>

    <description>Given that the average wait time for a deceased donor kidney transplant is five years on average in Ontario, our intervention is likely to have only a small impact on the rate of deceased donor kidney transplants. For this reason, we have pre-specified five secondary outcomes to examine the impact of our intervention on the rate of living kidney donor transplant activity.</description>
