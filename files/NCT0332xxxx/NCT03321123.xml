  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in childhood.&#xD;
      Despite major advances in ALL therapy, 20% of children and 40-50% of adults fail state-of-the&#xD;
      art first-line treatment. But there is a strong need for alternative treatments to cure&#xD;
      chemotherapy-refractory and relapsed B cell malignancies in pediatric patients. Relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory B cell malignancies remain a therapeutic challenge, as these diseases are&#xD;
      characterized by adverse survival. These cancers share a cell origin from the B-cell lineage&#xD;
      and consequent surface expression of B-lineage markers such as CD19 and CD22. Chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor (CAR) engineered T cell therapy has recently emerged as a new modality to&#xD;
      target B cell malignancies. CARs couple a single-chain Fv (scFv) domain directed against a&#xD;
      B-lineage-specific antigen to T-cell activating intracellular signaling domains. CAR&#xD;
      gene-modified T cell interaction with target cells occurs in a HLA-independent fashion, so&#xD;
      that a single vector can be used to treat all patients with cancers that express the target&#xD;
      antigen. Miltenyi Biotec has established a semi-automated manufacturing process that can be&#xD;
      made available to academic settings for systematic exploration of CAR strategies in advanced&#xD;
      clinical studies. Closed-system operation, improved robustness, simplified work flows, and&#xD;
      reduced labor intensity, while maintaining strict adherence to regulatory guidelines, allows&#xD;
      for decentralized manufacturing. In the proposed phase II study, the investigator will&#xD;
      explore autologous 2nd generation CD19 CAR T cell products in patients with relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory disease incurable with standard therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized phase II paediatric study. In this study, eligible&#xD;
      patients will receive autologous T cells transduced with the lentiviral vector pLTG1563&#xD;
      (MB-CART19.1) at a doesage of 2x10e6 ~2x10e7 CAR-transduced T cells/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, leukapheresis will be performed for MB-CART19.1 generation. Patients with&#xD;
      high disease burden at screening (e.g. ALL with M3 marrow and 10.000/L blasts in peripheral&#xD;
      blood) may receive bridging chemotherapy after leukapheresis, to avoid critical tumor lysis&#xD;
      syndrome and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) by subsequent lymphodepleting chemotherapy and&#xD;
      CAR transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine 30 mg/m2/d&#xD;
      intravenously (iv) on days -5,-4,-3 and -2 cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/d iv on day -3,-2&#xD;
      before CAR T cell transfer to enhance the in vivo expansion of CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive freshly prepared MB-CART19.1 on day 0, corresponding to day 12 (48&#xD;
      hours) of manufacturing, at a dose of 2x10e6 ~2x10e7/kg MB-CART19.1 T cells as defined in the&#xD;
      study design section. The appropriate volume for the target cell dose will be drawn up and&#xD;
      given as an IV injection over 30 minutes through a large vein peripherally or centrally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of MB-CART19.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the biological activity of adoptive transfer of autologous MB-CART19.1 in&#xD;
           patients with R/R CD19-positive B cell lymphoblastic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is Overall response rate (ORR):ORR in ALL patients is defined as the&#xD;
      rate of complete remission (CR, CRh) on day 28.&#xD;
