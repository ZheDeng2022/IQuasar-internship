  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether iovera° treatment prior to TKA decreases&#xD;
      cumulative participant opioid use over the course of 6 weeks following TKA while maintaining&#xD;
      similar levels of pain relief. The study will also investigate whether there is a&#xD;
      relationship between participants treated with iovera° and participant reported pain and&#xD;
      function as measured by knee injury and osteoarthritis outcomes score (KOOS JR), numeric&#xD;
      rating scale (NRS) for pain; use of hospital services post-TKA and improved physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation as measured by range of motion.&#xD;

    <measure>Cumulative Opioid Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of TKA surgery to 6 weeks post-TKA surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative consumption of opioids was determined from the time of Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) surgery to 6 weeks post-TKA surgery. Opioid consumption was converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and participant consumption was verified by pill count at follow-up visits. The cumulative morphine equivalent was divided by the number of days to provide the total daily morphine equivalent (TME) for the participant,</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve (AUC)/Time for Change From Baseline in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS JR.) Overall Score Through 6 Weeks Post-TKA</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks post-TKA surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS JR. was a participant completed questionnaire that consists of 7 questions from 3 subscales: stiffness (1 question), pain (4 questions), and function in daily living (2 questions). Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question was assigned a score from none (0) to extreme (4). A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) was calculated. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement. AUC/time based on Changes from Baseline in KOOS JR. scores through 6 weeks post-TKA, is the AUC of Change in KOOS JR. scores from the Baseline visit through the 6-week visit divided by the number of days from TKA until the 6-week visit. AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and the changes in the KOOS JR. score at the following time points: Baseline (change=0), 72 hours, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks post-TKA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>AUC/Time for Change From Baseline in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Pain Through 6 Weeks Post-TKA</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks post-TKA surgery</time_frame>
    <description>NRS was an 11-point scale for self-reporting of pain intensity by participants. Scores range from 0 to 10, where 0 points equals &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 points equals the &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. A positive change represented improvement (or reduction) in pain intensity. AUC/time based on Changes from Baseline in NRS Pain score through 6 weeks post-TKA, is the AUC of Change in NRS for Pain score from the Baseline visit through the 6-week visit divided by the number of days from TKA until the 6-week visit. AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and the changes in the NRS for Pain score at the following time points: Baseline (change=0), 72 hours, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks post-TKA.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>AUC/Time for Change From Baseline in Timed Get Up and Go (TUG) Tests Through 6 Weeks Post-TKA</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks post-TKA surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The time required by the participants to raise from sitting, walk 10 feet, turn around, walk back and sit back down was measured in seconds. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement. AUC/time based on Changes from Baseline in the TUG test through 6 weeks post-TKA, is the AUC of Change in TUG test from the Baseline visit through the 6-week visit divided by the number of days from TKA until the 6-week visit. AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and the changes in the TUG test at the following time points: Baseline (change=0), 72 hours, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks post-TKA.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Curve (AUC)/Time for Change From Baseline in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS JR.) Overall Score Through 6 Weeks Post-TKA</title>
        <description>The KOOS JR. was a participant completed questionnaire that consists of 7 questions from 3 subscales: stiffness (1 question), pain (4 questions), and function in daily living (2 questions). Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question was assigned a score from none (0) to extreme (4). A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) was calculated. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement. AUC/time based on Changes from Baseline in KOOS JR. scores through 6 weeks post-TKA, is the AUC of Change in KOOS JR. scores from the Baseline visit through the 6-week visit divided by the number of days from TKA until the 6-week visit. AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and the changes in the KOOS JR. score at the following time points: Baseline (change=0), 72 hours, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks post-TKA.</description>

        <title>AUC/Time for Change From Baseline in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Pain Through 6 Weeks Post-TKA</title>
        <description>NRS was an 11-point scale for self-reporting of pain intensity by participants. Scores range from 0 to 10, where 0 points equals &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 points equals the &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. A positive change represented improvement (or reduction) in pain intensity. AUC/time based on Changes from Baseline in NRS Pain score through 6 weeks post-TKA, is the AUC of Change in NRS for Pain score from the Baseline visit through the 6-week visit divided by the number of days from TKA until the 6-week visit.

        <description>The time required by the participants to raise from sitting, walk 10 feet, turn around, walk back and sit back down was measured in seconds. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement. AUC/time based on Changes from Baseline in the TUG test through 6 weeks post-TKA, is the AUC of Change in TUG test from the Baseline visit through the 6-week visit divided by the number of days from TKA until the 6-week visit. AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and the changes in the TUG test at the following time points: Baseline (change=0), 72 hours, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks post-TKA.</description>
