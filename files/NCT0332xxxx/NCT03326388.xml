    <textblock>
      Phase I and II study of the MEK inhibitor Selumetinib given twice daily on 5 out of 7 days in&#xD;
      children with NF1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas or progressive/relapsed optic&#xD;
      pathway gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the early and late toxicities of selumetinib when it is given in this&#xD;
      intermittent schedule (in 5 out of 7 days) and will also test the effectiveness of the drug&#xD;
      in reducing the size of plexiform neurofibromas and optic pathway gliomas in children with&#xD;
      NF1. It will also test the effectiveness of the drug in improving the participants function&#xD;
      in day to day life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant, progressive disorder with an&#xD;
      incidence of 1 in 3,500 of the population. NF1 is characterized by diverse, progressive&#xD;
      cutaneous, neurological, skeletal and neoplastic manifestations with no standard drug&#xD;
      treatment options available. Patients with NF1 have an increased risk of developing tumours&#xD;
      of the central and peripheral nervous system including plexiform neurofibromas (PN) (27%) and&#xD;
      optic gliomas (15-20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic aberrations targeting the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling&#xD;
      pathway are a hallmark molecular feature of Low Grade Gliomas (including optic pathway&#xD;
      gliomas) and NF1 as well as some low-grade glial-neuronal tumours. The gene responsible for&#xD;
      NF1 has been cloned and encodes a protein called neurofibromin. Loss of Neurofibromin is&#xD;
      associated with elevated levels of Ras, and Activated Ras results in the initiation of a&#xD;
      cascade of signalling events such as activation of Raf and MAPK that leads to increased cell&#xD;
      proliferation. Thus MAPK inhibitors offer an attractive novel therapeutic option for both NF1&#xD;
      related PN and optic pathway gliomas&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will comprise 2 phases. Phase 1 will be a dose escalation phase, designed to&#xD;
      establish the correct dose of selumetinib. Phase 1 will be open to NF-1 participants, aged 3&#xD;
      to ≤18 years with inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN). This phase of the study will&#xD;
      investigate a new intermittent schedule of oral administration of selumetinib, (given twice&#xD;
      daily on 5 out of every 7 days) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose. The starting dose level will be 25mg/m2/dose given twice daily.&#xD;
      This was the MTD determined by the Paediatric Brain Tumour Consortium study of Selumetinib in&#xD;
      children with NF1 related LGG and the National Cancer Institute study of children with NF1&#xD;
      inoperable PN. In both of these trials selumetinib was given twice daily, every day. The&#xD;
      purpose of this phase 1 study will allow the investigators to define the acute and chronic&#xD;
      toxicities and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Selumetinib in this population and contribute to&#xD;
      determining the effect of Selumetinib on the growth rate of PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 part of the study will be a dose expansion study and will be open to 2 groups of&#xD;
      participants. Those with progressive NF-1 related optic pathway gliomas (OPG), and those with&#xD;
      NF1 related inoperable PN. This part of the study will only commence when the recommended&#xD;
      phase 2 dose is established from part 1. The purpose of this part of the study is to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of the 5 out of 7 day intermittent dosing schedule of&#xD;
      Selumetinib, using response rates (and duration of response), appropriate MRI criteria and&#xD;
      functional assessments (REINs criteria). The investigators plan to further evaluate the acute&#xD;
      and chronic toxicities of selumetinib in this population and to assess the clinical status&#xD;
      and quality of life in this population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age Phase I: ≥3 years and ≤18 years of age at the time of study enrolment, if able to&#xD;
             swallow whole capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age Phase II: ≥3 years and ≤ 18 years. BSA ≥ 0.55 m2, if able to swallow whole&#xD;
             capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis: Phase I (Dose escalation): Patients with NF1 and inoperable PNs defined as&#xD;
             PNs that cannot be surgically completely removed without risk for substantial&#xD;
             morbidity due to: encasement of or close proximity to vital structures, invasiveness,&#xD;
             or high vascularity of the PN. The PN has to cause morbidity or have the potential to&#xD;
             cause significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and neck lesions that&#xD;
             could compromise the airway or great vessels, brachial or lumbar plexus lesions that&#xD;
             could cause nerve compression and loss of function, lesions that could result in major&#xD;
             deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or are significantly disfiguring, lesions of the&#xD;
             extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Histological confirmation of tumour is not necessary in the presence of consistent&#xD;
             clinical and radiographic findings, but should be considered if malignant degeneration&#xD;
             of a PN is clinically suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Phase 2 (Dose expansion): Two cohorts are eligible for inclusion in the dose expansion&#xD;
             cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Cohort A (10 subjects) Subjects with NF1 and inoperable PNs (as per Phase I) and&#xD;
             Cohort B (10 subjects) Subjects with NF-1 related progressive optic pathway glioma are&#xD;
             eligible if the subject has evidence of either clinical (e.g. worsening visual&#xD;
             function as per REiNS) or MRI based significant radiological progression and has had&#xD;
             at least two lines of standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             In addition, all study subjects (phase I and II) must have either positive genetic&#xD;
             testing for NF1 from a certified laboratory or have at least one other diagnostic&#xD;
             criterion for NF1 listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Six or more café-au-lait macules (≥0.5cm in prepubertal subjects or ≥1.5 cm in&#xD;
                  post pubertal subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Freckling in axilla or groin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Optic glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two or more Lisch nodules&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or&#xD;
                  thinning of long bone cortex)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A first-degree relative with NF1&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Measurable disease (PN): Subjects must have at least one measurable PN, defined as a&#xD;
             lesion of at least 3 cm measured in one dimension. Subjects who underwent surgery for&#xD;
             resection of a PN are eligible provided the PN was incompletely resected and is&#xD;
             measurable. Measurable disease (OPG): Subjects must have one measurable OPG lesions&#xD;
             according to RANO 1.1 i.e. Tumour ≥10 x10mm in maximal perpendicular dimensions on an&#xD;
             axial image on MRI with ≤5 mm reconstruction interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior Therapy: Subjects with NF1 will only be eligible if complete tumour resection is&#xD;
             not considered to be feasible without substantial risk or morbidity, or if a patient&#xD;
             with a surgical option refuses surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with NF1 and PN,&#xD;
                  subjects may be treated on this trial without having received prior medical&#xD;
                  therapy directed at their PN. For Phase 2 Cohort B in subjects with NF-1 related&#xD;
                  OPGs at least two prior standard therapies need to have been received.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects who have received previous investigational agents or biologic therapy&#xD;
                  except a prior MEK inhibitor are eligible for enrollment. At least 4 weeks must&#xD;
                  have elapsed since receiving medical therapy directed at the PN. Patients who&#xD;
                  received prior medical therapy for their PN must have recovered from the acute&#xD;
                  toxic effects of all prior therapy to ≤ grade 1 CTCAEv4 before entering this&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function must not&#xD;
                  have been administered within the past 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 6 weeks must have elapsed prior to enrollment since the patient received&#xD;
                  any prior radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Performance status: Patients ≥ 16 years of age must have a Karnofsky performance level&#xD;
             of ≥70%, and children &lt; 16 years old must have a Lansky performance of ≥70% (Error!&#xD;
             Reference source not found.). Patients who are wheelchair bound because of paralysis&#xD;
             secondary to a plexiform neurofibroma should be considered ambulatory when they are up&#xD;
             in their wheelchair. Similarly, patients with limited mobility secondary to need for&#xD;
             mechanical support (such as an airway PN requiring tracheostomy or CPAP) will also be&#xD;
             considered ambulatory for the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Haematological Function: Patients must have an absolute neutrophil count ≥1500/µl,&#xD;
             haemoglobin ≥9g/dl, and platelet ≥100,000/µl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Hepatic Function: Patients must have bilirubin within 1.5 x the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             for age, with the exception of those with Gilbert syndrome, and AST/ALT within ≤ 2.5 x&#xD;
             upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Renal Function: Patients must have a creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR&#xD;
             ≥60ml/min/1.73 m2 or a normal serum creatinine based on age described in the table&#xD;
             below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age (years) Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) age ≤5: 0.8 5&lt;age≤10: 1.0 10&lt;age≤15: 1.2&#xD;
             age&gt;15: 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Cardiac Function: Normal ejection fraction (ECHO) ≥ 55%, or institutional normal value&#xD;
             (if a range is given then the upper value of the range will be used); QTcF ≤450 msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate Blood Pressure defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A blood pressure (BP) ≤ the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender. Adequate&#xD;
             blood pressure can be achieved using medications for treatment of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Informed Consent: Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine&#xD;
             eligibility for this trial must only be done after obtaining written informed consent&#xD;
             from all patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is &lt;16 years old). When&#xD;
             appropriate, paediatric patients will be included in all discussions and appropriate&#xD;
             assent taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Willingness to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate sunscreen protection if&#xD;
             sun exposure is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Willingness to avoid the ingestion of grapefruit and Seville oranges (as well as other&#xD;
             products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or marmalade) during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded due to potential risks of foetal and&#xD;
             teratogenic adverse events of an investigational agent. Pregnancy tests must be&#xD;
             obtained prior to enrolment on this study for girls of reproductive potential. The&#xD;
             need to commence pregnancy testing will be at the discretion of the treating physician&#xD;
             to facilitate taking in to account factors such as precocious puberty, endocrine&#xD;
             status and medications which can affect pubertal status. Males or females of&#xD;
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective&#xD;
             contraceptive method. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Phase I: Patients who anticipate the need for surgical intervention within the first&#xD;
             three cycles (3 months), as surgical intervention during the period of DLT evaluation&#xD;
             may affect analysis of adherence and/or make the subject in-evaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Phase II: Patients who anticipate the need for surgical intervention of the target PN&#xD;
             within the first eight cycles (8 months), as surgical intervention during the period&#xD;
             may affect analysis of response and may make the subject in-evaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. An investigational agent within the past 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any unresolved chronic toxicity with toxicity ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 from previous&#xD;
             anti-cancer therapy, except for alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ongoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy directed at the tumour,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, or biological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, active infection, active&#xD;
             bleeding diatheses or renal transplant, including any patient known to have hepatitis&#xD;
             B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the&#xD;
             safety monitoring requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Inability to swallow capsules, since capsules cannot be crushed or broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Inability to undergo MRI and/or contraindication for MRI examinations following the&#xD;
             MRI protocol. Prosthesis or orthopaedic or dental braces that would interfere with&#xD;
             volumetric analysis of target PN on MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory&#xD;
             bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate&#xD;
             absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Prior treatment with selumetinib or another specific MEK1/2 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;

             for control of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Cardiac Function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Known inherited coronary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV prior or current cardiomyopathy, or&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Ophthalmologic conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Current or past history of central serous retinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Current or past history of retinal vein occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with controlled known glaucoma and increased IOP who do not have&#xD;
                  meaningful vision (light perception only or no light perception) and are not&#xD;
                  experiencing pain related to the glaucoma, may be eligible after discussion with&#xD;
                  the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects with any other significant abnormality on ophthalmic examination&#xD;
                  (performed by an ophthalmologist) should be discussed with the PI for potential&#xD;
                  eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Ophthalmological findings secondary to optic pathway glioma (such as visual loss,&#xD;
                  optic nerve pallor or strabismus) or long-standing orbito-temporal PN (such as&#xD;
                  visual loss, strabismus) will NOT be considered a significant abnormality for the&#xD;
                  purposes of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Clinical judgement by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. While not an exclusion criterion, unless considered clinically indicated, patients&#xD;
             should avoid taking other additional non-study medications that may interfere with the&#xD;
             study medication. In particular, patients should avoid medications that are known to&#xD;
             either induce or inhibit the activity of hepatic microsomal isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C19&#xD;
             and CYP3A4, as this may interfere with the metabolism of selumetinib.&#xD;
