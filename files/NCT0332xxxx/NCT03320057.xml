  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mixed-methods study follows a prospective cohort of patients receiving Mifeprex ®&#xD;
      (mifepristone) for medication abortion dispensed by pharmacists after undergoing standard&#xD;
      clinical evaluation. Women participating in this study will obtain mifepristone and&#xD;
      misoprostol from the pharmacy instead of in the clinic. To assess feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and effectiveness of pharmacy dispensing of mifepristone, the study will survey patients,&#xD;
      evaluate their clinical outcomes from electronic health records, and survey and interview&#xD;
      pharmacists at study sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improving access to and efficiency of abortion provision is important for patients and&#xD;
      providers. The Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requires that Mifeprex ® (&#xD;
      mifepristone) be dispensed only from a doctor's office, clinic or hospital (not from a&#xD;
      pharmacy by prescription) by a certified health care provider and the health care provider&#xD;
      must obtained a signed Patient Agreement Form before dispensing mifepristone. Data are needed&#xD;
      to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of pharmacy dispensing of&#xD;
      mifepristone. In order to address the study question, a mixed methods study design is&#xD;
      appropriate. To assess feasibility, the study will collect data on pharmacists' satisfaction&#xD;
      with dispensing mifepristone. To assess acceptability, qualitative data will be collected&#xD;
      from pharmacists about their perspectives on dispensing Mifeprex before and after the study,&#xD;
      as well as measure patient satisfaction through open-ended and close-ended survey questions.&#xD;
      To assess effectiveness of the pharmacy dispensing model, the study will evaluate clinical&#xD;
      outcomes from electronic health records. The proposed feasibility study would take place at&#xD;
      sites in California and Washington states.&#xD;

    <measure>Difference in Pharmacists' Mean Knowledge Score Related to Medication Abortion</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after the intervention, approximately month 1 and month 18 of the study to assess differences in knowledge</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in pharmacists' mean knowledge score related to medication abortion. Knowledge scores were based on a set of 15 statements or questions related to medication abortion for which respondents selected answer(s) from multiple choice response options. Topics included medication abortion dosing regimen, biological processes during medication abortion, clinical outcomes, and federal and state policies relating to medication abortion. For pharmacists who had completed at least 50% of the items, we calculated their average number of correct responses among completed items, as a proportion of correct answers, ranging from 0-1, with 1 meaning 100% correct. All questions or statements included an &quot;I don't know&quot; response option, which we coded as incorrect. Higher scores mean a higher level of knowledge.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Patient Recruitment: Study recruitment began in July 2018 and was halted before reaching our desired sample size in March 2020 owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which limited the ability to have research staff in clinical facilities and lengthen patient visits for the purposes of research consent.&#xD;
Pharmacist Recruitment: We invited all pharmacists providing services at the study pharmacies to participate in the study and dispense mifepristone to study patients.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Research staff assessed 499 patients for eligibility, of whom 233 were ineligible (n=163) or declined to participate (n=70). We enrolled 266 patient participants, all of whom received the study medications from the pharmacy. We invited 72 pharmacists working at six study pharmacy sites to participate in the study, including training to dispense mifepristone and completion of the baseline survey.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Difference in Pharmacists' Mean Knowledge Score Related to Medication Abortion</title>
        <description>Difference in pharmacists' mean knowledge score related to medication abortion. Knowledge scores were based on a set of 15 statements or questions related to medication abortion for which respondents selected answer(s) from multiple choice response options. Topics included medication abortion dosing regimen, biological processes during medication abortion, clinical outcomes, and federal and state policies relating to medication abortion. For pharmacists who had completed at least 50% of the items, we calculated their average number of correct responses among completed items, as a proportion of correct answers, ranging from 0-1, with 1 meaning 100% correct. All questions or statements included an &quot;I don't know&quot; response option, which we coded as incorrect. Higher scores mean a higher level of knowledge.</description>

            <non_inferiority_desc>We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses using Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models to assess whether study implementation was associated with pharmacists' overall medication abortion knowledge. Multivariable GEE analyses included time period (baseline and endline) as the primary independent variable, adjusted for gender and years of experience, and accounted for clustering by pharmacy site and individual pharmacist.</non_inferiority_desc>
