  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reflexion on the therapeutic strategies to implement in patients at the end of life is&#xD;
      advancing rapidly in France. However, beyond the choices presented to patients, sometimes&#xD;
      even the decision to carry on, to limit or to stop treatments is also questioned. This&#xD;
      decision is subjective; it is influenced by the patient's representation system (emotions,&#xD;
      beliefs, values, practices, etc). In addition, even though he or she is the focus of the&#xD;
      decision, the patient is not alone; other actors, accompanying the patient, play an important&#xD;
      role in the final decision making. These actors, namely the doctors and close relatives, are&#xD;
      also influenced in their decision making. This coexistence of representation systems may&#xD;
      interfere with objective indicators that help in decision making (functional, clinical and&#xD;
      biological) or with the knowledge acquired by doctors in their training and may complicate&#xD;
      the decision-making process.&#xD;
