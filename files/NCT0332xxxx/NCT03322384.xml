    <textblock>
      Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of a variety of advanced&#xD;
      malignancies. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD-1 / PD-L1 interaction have received FDA&#xD;
      approvals for non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, hepatocellular, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, microsatellite&#xD;
      instability high colorectal carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and classical Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma. Despite the promising evidence for deep and durable responses with these agents,&#xD;
      the majority of patients either fail to respond or develop resistance to treatment. Thus,&#xD;
      there is interested in developing alternative immunotherapeutic strategies. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that a novel immunotherapeutic combination of radiotherapy (RT) with&#xD;
      intralesional CpG and indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase blockade may offer significant clinical&#xD;
      benefit to patients and proposing a microtrial testing this combination for&#xD;
      advanced/refractory solid tumors and lymphoma.&#xD;

      Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of a variety of advanced&#xD;
      malignancies. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD-1 / PD-L1 interaction have received FDA&#xD;
      approvals for non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, hepatocellular, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, microsatellite&#xD;

      lymphoma. Despite the promising evidence for deep and durable responses with these agents,&#xD;
      the majority of patients either fail to respond or develop resistance to treatment. Thus,&#xD;
      there is interested in developing alternative immunotherapeutic strategies. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that a novel immunotherapeutic combination of radiotherapy (RT)with intralesional&#xD;
      CpG and indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) blockade may offer significant clinical benefit to&#xD;
      patients and proposing a microtrial testing this combination for advanced/refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors and lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unmethylated CpG DNA is a component bacterial genomes and is the agonist of Toll Like&#xD;
      Receptor-9, an endosomal pattern recognition receptor of antigen presenting cells. TLR9&#xD;
      activation results in downstream production of IFN-Î±, interleukin-6 interleukin-12. These&#xD;
      cytokines induce naive T cells to differentiate to helper T cells. CpG has demonstrated&#xD;
      significant synergy with radiotherapy to induce regression of refractory systemic and&#xD;
      cutaneous lymphomas both within radiation treatment field and un-irradiated metastases.&#xD;
      SD-101 is a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide enriched with CpG motifs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IDO is an enzyme that converts the essential amino acid tryptophan to kynurenine. The&#xD;
      availability of tryptophan is essential to sustaining both helper T cell and effector T cell&#xD;
      activation. Overexpression of IDO by tumor cells or antigen presenting cells serves to arrest&#xD;
      T cell activation thus acting as an immunosuppressive enzyme. Epacadostat (INCB024360) is an&#xD;
      inhibitor of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) that has shown promise in the&#xD;
      treatment of solid tumors and lymphomas in ongoing Phase I/II studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have shown in animal studies that IDO upregulation limits tumor response to&#xD;
      RT + CpG and that addition of IDO blockade improves therapeutic efficacy. On the basis of&#xD;
      these data, the investigators hypothesize that IDO inhibition will improve upon the known&#xD;
      historical efficacy of RT + CpG therapy, and will be highly effective and well tolerated in&#xD;
      the management of advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I/II study. For the phase I portion the primary endpoint is to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of epacadostat in combination with radiotherapy and SD-101. For the&#xD;
      phase II portion the primary endpoint is safety and toxicity per CTCAE v4.03 criteriae. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoint is the abscopal response rate defined as the objective response rate at&#xD;
      un-irradiated lesions per irRECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to three dose levels of epacadostat will be evaluated: 100 mg bid, 200 mg bid and 300 mg&#xD;
      bid each day of the study. Radiotherapy will be delivered to the treatment lesion during the&#xD;
      first week using standard-of-care palliative fractionation regimens of 8 Gy x 3 fractions, 4&#xD;
      Gy x 5 fractions, or 2 Gy x 2 fractions. Four milligrams of SD-101 will be delivered into the&#xD;
      treatment lesion by intralesional injection on days 1, 8, 15, with optional additional&#xD;
      injections on days 22, and 29. On Day 1, biopsy will precede intralesional injection, RT, or&#xD;
      epacadostat. Intralesional injections will be performed by palpation of the lesion or under&#xD;
      ultrasound or CT guidance as indicated. CT response assessments and labs will be performed&#xD;
      every 60 days. Patients will continue on epacadostat until progression.&#xD;
