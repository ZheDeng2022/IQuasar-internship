  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developed by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Project&#xD;
      UPLIFT (Using Practice and Learning to Increase Favorable Thoughts) is a group telephone&#xD;
      program designed to improve depression for people with epilepsy. Project UPLIFT uses&#xD;
      evidence-based approaches of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based&#xD;
      cognitive therapy to help people manage and prevent symptoms of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For people with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, there are few treatment options for&#xD;
      depression that address the relationship between mood and seizures. There is evidence that&#xD;
      mindfulness-based therapy and cognitive therapy are both effective for people with&#xD;
      non-epileptic seizures, both in treating depression and reducing seizure frequency. In this&#xD;
      study, Project UPLIFT will be offered to patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project UPLIFT is facilitated by a trained clinician to groups of 4-8 patients over the&#xD;
      telephone. The group will meet at a regular time, once a week, for 8 consecutive weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of two groups: an immediate-treatment or a waitlist&#xD;
      control group which will begin Project UPLIFT 3 months after enrolling in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon enrollment in the study, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: an&#xD;
      immediate-treatment group, or a 3-month waitlist control group. Both groups will be given&#xD;
      surveys to complete online, and a seizure calendar to keep track of auras, seizures, and&#xD;
      events. The immediate-treatment group will be scheduled to start Project UPLIFT with their&#xD;
      trained facilitator. Each of the eight weekly sessions will take place at the same day of the&#xD;
      week and at the same time, and will last approximately one hour. Participants will have the&#xD;
      option of using a fake-name during the telephone calls to conceal their identity during the&#xD;
      group telephone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 8 weekly sessions, both groups will be given a second set of online surveys to&#xD;
      complete individually. At this time, the waitlist control group will be scheduled to start&#xD;
      Project UPLIFT with the trained facilitator. After the waitlist group completes the final&#xD;
      session of Project UPLIFT, both groups will complete a third and final set of online surveys,&#xD;
      thus concluding all study procedures.&#xD;

    <description>Change from baseline in seizure frequency on the self-report seizure questionnaire. The self-report seizure questionnaire asks participants to report the number of seizures they have had in the previous week, month, and year. There is no upper limit of the scale, and is not a standardized survey.</description>
