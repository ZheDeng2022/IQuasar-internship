      This study aims to investigate the effect of robot-assisted laparoscopic kidney&#xD;
      transplantation on kidney injury by measuring biomarkers of kidney injury which are found in&#xD;
      blood and urine to establish if there is a significant difference between robotic and open&#xD;
      surgery. The study will also investigate the potential benefits of minimally invasive surgery&#xD;
      on the surgical trauma associated with open surgery by assessing the surgical stress response&#xD;
      between groups of kidney transplant patients receiving either open or minimally invasive&#xD;
      kidney transplants and by comparing wound healing with patients undergoing donor nephrectomy.&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Living donor kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for end stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESKD). This process involves a mandatory period of warm and cold ischaemia before the donor&#xD;
      kidney is reperfused. The reperfusion injury causes damage to the transplanted kidney that&#xD;
      may affect its long term outcome. In living donor kidney transplantation this period of&#xD;
      ischaemia is kept to a minimum. However, minimally invasive kidney transplantation (MIKT) has&#xD;
      been shown to increase the warm ischaemia time for these patients due to the prolonged&#xD;
      anastomosis time and the graft and patient are exposed to pneumoperitoneum for a significant&#xD;
      amount of time. It is not clear if these events affect graft outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers of acute kidney injury are of interest in transplantation as they may be used to&#xD;
      assess the severity of graft injury and predict the likely clinical outcomes at an early&#xD;
      stage. There is evidence that they can predict delayed graft function after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIKT also has the potential in reducing the surgical trauma associated with open surgery due&#xD;
      to smaller incisions; this may reduce infections and improve wound healing. Evidence from&#xD;
      laparoscopic donor nephrectomy shows clear benefits to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key issue arising from MIKT is its effect on the kidney allograft. The robotic kidney&#xD;
      transplant technique prolongs the re-warming time due to the longer anastomosis time. Results&#xD;
      suggest that this may reduce the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the early&#xD;
      post-transplant period when compared to open kidney transplant with no difference in function&#xD;
      at 1 and 2 year follow-up. The long-term consequences for the graft beyond this period are&#xD;
      unknown. The effects of pneumoperitoneum on the transplant kidney have also been questioned&#xD;
      with suggestions that higher intra-abdominal pressures may reduce allograft perfusion during&#xD;
      surgery with negative consequences for the allograft based on experience with other studies&#xD;
      of both human and animal models. There is unpublished data that suggests that the effects on&#xD;
      longer term graft outcomes are not significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIKT promises to offer significant benefits to kidney transplant recipients including less&#xD;
      manipulation of the graft during surgery and a reduction in surgical site infections which&#xD;
      has already been noted in obese patients undergoing robotic MIKT. Smaller incisions with&#xD;
      reduced analgesia requirement are a key benefit which may affect length of stay and&#xD;
      associated co-morbidity, hospital costs and the patient experience which has been&#xD;
      demonstrated with the donor nephrectomy operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression of several biomarkers of kidney injury has been demonstrated to reflect damage&#xD;
      to the graft and subsequent kidney function in living donor kidney transplantation. These&#xD;
      biomarkers, including Kidney Injury Molecule 1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase associated&#xD;
      lipocalin (NGAL) and interleukin 18 (IL-18) are expressed in both serum and urine. Changes in&#xD;
      their expression can predict some outcomes after transplantation. These biomarkers offer an&#xD;
      advantage over traditional means of assessing kidney injury and function after&#xD;
      transplantation such as serum creatinine measurement, urine output and kidney biopsy in that&#xD;
      they can be detected early in the spectrum of acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ESRD usually have multiple co-morbidities and are less able to withstand the&#xD;
      stress of major surgery compared to other patients leading to greater mortality and&#xD;
      complications. MIKT may reduce the surgical stress burden for these patients, compared with&#xD;
      open surgery, but this is currently uncertain. Evidence from other fields of surgery has&#xD;
      shown that the changes in the metabolic stress response to open and minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgery can be quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose to perform this study to assess the impact of minimally invasive kidney&#xD;
      transplantation on the transplant kidney and the recipient by observing the expression of&#xD;
      biomarkers and establishing their relationship to outcomes after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Study Objectives, Design and Statistics 2.1. Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the effect of the warm ischaemia time and pneumoperitoneum on&#xD;
      kidney injury by measuring biomarkers of acute kidney injury which are found in blood and&#xD;
      urine to establish if there is a significant difference between robotic and open surgery. The&#xD;
      study will also investigate the potential benefits of minimally invasive surgery on the&#xD;
      surgical trauma associated with open surgery by assessing the surgical stress response and&#xD;
      wound healing between groups of kidney transplant patients receiving either open or minimally&#xD;
      invasive kidney transplants. Wound healing will also be compared with patients undergoing a&#xD;
      different minimally invasive surgical technique (laparoscopic donor nephrectomy) as they will&#xD;
      have a similar incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the difference in expression of plasma and serum biomarkers of&#xD;
      kidney injury and surgical stress in the recipient groups. The secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      include clinical outcomes such as infection, graft function and acute rejection, evidence of&#xD;
      wound healing as assessed by ultrasound scan and quality of life outcomes assessed by&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Study Design &amp; Flowchart The study will be conducted on an observational case-control&#xD;
      basis comparing groups of patients receiving standard care in three arms: open living donor&#xD;
      kidney transplantation, robotic living donor kidney transplantation and laparscopic donor&#xD;
      nephrectomy. Biomarkers of kidney injury and the surgical stress response will be measured in&#xD;
      plasma and urine of the recipients only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive information leaflets during education sessions prior to&#xD;
      transplantation or donor surgery. Information about the study will be given during this&#xD;
      period and they will also be approached in clinic prior to surgery to gain their informed&#xD;
      consent after they have had the time to consider the information about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood samples collected for the study at the same time as their&#xD;
      routine clinical samples are taken wherever possible. These samples will be collected on the&#xD;
      day of surgery and all post-operative days until day seven after surgery if they are&#xD;
      inpatients. Additional samples will be collected at non-routine times in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      after transplant surgery only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples will be collected from the catheter during surgery and each post-operative day&#xD;
      up till day seven after surgery if they are inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be offered the opportunity of undergoing an optional bedside ultrasound&#xD;
      scan of their abdominal wall incision at day three post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final blood and urine samples will be collected at the time of the participant's routine&#xD;
      post-operative visit at 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers will be measured using Luminex and ELISA techniques as appropriate. The biomarkers&#xD;
      to be measured will include Kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), Neutrophil&#xD;
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and Interleukin-18 (IL-18).&#xD;
