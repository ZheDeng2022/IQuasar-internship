  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the current study was to investigate the effect of class IV laser therapy and Pilates&#xD;
      exercises on bone density in Osteoporosis.Sixty patients with osteoporosis (T-score values&#xD;
      below -2.5) in lumbar spine with no evidence of vertebral compression fractures were&#xD;
      recruited from October 6 University Hospital and Kaser El-aini Hospital, Cairo - Egypt from&#xD;
      February 2019 to November 2019. Their age ranged from 40 to 60 years old. Patients with a&#xD;
      history of tumors, ovariectomy, heart disease, renal failure, disc prolapse, or any trauma to&#xD;
      the back area were excluded from the study&#xD;

      They were allocated randomly into three groups: Group A consists of 20 patients received a&#xD;
      multiwave locked system laser, group B consists of 20 patients received Pilates exercises and&#xD;
      group C consists of 20 patients received a multiwave locked system laser and Pilates&#xD;
      exercises. Patients with a history of tumors, ovariectomy, heart disease, renal failure, disc&#xD;
      prolapse, or any trauma to the back area were excluded from the study. All patients who&#xD;
      participated in the current study did not intake any medications to accelerate bone density&#xD;
      like vitamin D or calcium. The randomization method was applied by asking each patient to&#xD;
      choose a piece of paper that the (A), (B), or (C) letter was written. (A) considered the LLLT&#xD;
      group, (B) considered the Pilates exercise group, while (C) considered the LLLT and Pilates&#xD;
      exercises group. Both patients, the examiner, and therapist were blinded from the selection&#xD;
      process.&#xD;

    <measure>Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was measured by using NPRS which consists of an11-points numeric scale range from '0' representing 'no pain' to '10' representing 'the worst pain'. All patients were instructed to choose a number from 0 to 10 that describe their pain. The classification of pain intensity on the scale was: 0 indicate no pain, points from 1-3 indicate mild pain, points from 4-6 indicate moderate pain, and points from 7-10 indicate severe pain</description>

    <description>performed by MLSÂ® Laser Therapy (ASA Srl, Vicenza, Italy). It is designed to synchronize between two modules. One is emitting at 905 nm, with peak optical power = 25 W; each pulse is composed of a pulse train (single pulse width = 100 ns, maximum frequency 90 kHz). The frequency of the pulse trains varied between 1 and 2000 Hz. The other one is emitting at 808 nm in a continuous mode (power 1.1 W) or pulsed mode (pulses repetition rate 1-2000 Hz).</description>
