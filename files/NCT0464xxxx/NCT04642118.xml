      Research objective to compare outcomes (shoulder pain score, wound pain score, post-operative&#xD;
      residual pneumoperitoneum, lung complication, GI discomfort, administered additional&#xD;
      analgesics, time to hospital staying) of using Pulmonary Recruitment maneuver with pressure&#xD;
      30 cmH2O, 40 cm H2O and control group in women with post laparoscopic gynecologic surgery in&#xD;
      Rajavithi hospital.&#xD;

      Research design is Randomized control trial. The women who go to laparoscopic gynecologic&#xD;
      surgery don't know the allocation. Women will be randomizes in to 3 group: PRM 30 cmH2O, 40&#xD;
      cmH2O and control&#xD;
&#xD;
      After laparoscopic surgery has finished in operator room (before moving off trocar), woman&#xD;
      all group will be set in Trenderlenberg position (Tilted head low) and then surgeon will&#xD;
      compress abdomen to release residual gas after operation about 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in group of using Pulmonary Recruitment Maneuver will be received positive&#xD;
      pressure from balloon bag from anesthesiologist 5 times of setting pressure [30 cmH2O, 40&#xD;
      cmH2O], 5 seconds per time to increase indirect abdominal pressure to release residual gas&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery at 12, 24 and 48 hours, patients will be follow up and evaluate shoulder and&#xD;
      wound pain. Chest X-ray will be done to evaluate residual pneumoperitoneum and lung&#xD;
      complication. GI discomfort, administered additional analgesics and time to hospital staying&#xD;
      will be evaluated and recorded.&#xD;
