  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spine pain is the leading cause of years lived with a disability and affects over 50&#xD;
      million individuals in the United States. Rates of spine surgeries performed to address&#xD;
      degenerative spine conditions have increased markedly. A subset of patients experience poor&#xD;
      pain, functional, or quality of life outcomes after surgery. This study will develop, pilot,&#xD;
      and evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of a one-on-one live, telehealth,&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention in patients following their lumbar spine surgery. The aim of the&#xD;
      intervention is to improve pain management, reduce the need for long-term pain medications,&#xD;
      and improve physical and psychological well-being after surgery.&#xD;
