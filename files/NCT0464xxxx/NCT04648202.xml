  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in adult participants diagnosed with advanced tumors to&#xD;
      characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity of FS120. This is&#xD;
      a Phase 1, multi-center, open label, multiple-dose, first in human study, designed to&#xD;
      systematically assess safety and tolerability, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for FS120 in participants with advanced tumors.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and response will also be assessed.&#xD;
