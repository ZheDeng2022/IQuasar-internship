  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-centre, 2-part study to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of inhaled AZD1402. Part 1 will be performed in a lead-in&#xD;
      cohort for each dose level to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) in a population&#xD;
      with asthma controlled on medium dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-long acting beta agonists&#xD;
      (LABA) before progressing to dosing in adults with asthma who are uncontrolled on medium dose&#xD;
      ICS-LABA in Part 2. The study will recruit participants receiving treatment with medium dose&#xD;
      ICS with LABA for Part 1 (separate inhalers or combination product) and medium dose ICS-LABA&#xD;
      as a combination product for Part 2 at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will be initiated for each dose level following evaluation of safety and PK at the&#xD;
      relevant dose level in Part 1. The entire study period for each participant in both Parts 1&#xD;
      and 2, is approximately 3.5 months; a 2-week Screening Period, a 4 week Run-in Period, 4&#xD;
      weeks of Treatment Period, and 4 weeks of Follow-Up Period.&#xD;

      Part 1 of the study will be randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, and conducted in&#xD;
      parallel for the 2 lower dose levels (Part 1a) followed by an unblinded safety review and&#xD;
      escalation to the highest dose (Part 1b) dependent on the outcome of the safety review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1a will consist of 30 participants who will be randomised 1:1:1 to receive 1 of the 2&#xD;
      lower AZD1402 dry power inhaler (DPI) doses (Dose 1 or Dose 2) or placebo in parallel. Part&#xD;
      1b will consist of 15 participants who will be randomised 2:1 to receive the highest AZD1402&#xD;
      DPI dose (Dose 3) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1a Lead-in Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AZD1402 Dose 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AZD1402 Dose 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1b Lead-in Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AZD1402 Dose 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will be randomised, double blind, placebo controlled and will include 360 participants&#xD;
      randomised 2:1 (active to placebo) to evaluate 3 inhaled dose levels of AZD1402 versus&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2a, which includes the 2 lower dose levels (Dose 1 and Dose 2) will be started in&#xD;
      parallel after the unblinded safety review for Part 1a. The higher dose of Dose 3 (Part 2b)&#xD;
      will be included in Part 2 following the unblinded review of Part 1b, depending on the&#xD;
      outcome of the safety review. Once Part 2b starts, all 3 dose levels (and placebo) will run&#xD;
      in parallel. Part 2 will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AZD1402 Dose 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AZD1402 Dose 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AZD1402 Dose 3&#xD;

    <description>To further investigate the efficacy of AZD1402 at different dose levels compared to placebo in adults with asthma who are uncontrolled on medium dose ICS-LABA. The ACQ was developed to measure asthma control. In the ACQ-6, participants will be asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week by responding to one bronchodilation use question and 5 symptom questions. Questions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). Higher scores indicated worse outcome. The mean ACQ-6 score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤ 0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.75 and ≤ 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and scores &gt; 1.5 indicate not well-controlled asthma. Individual changes of at least 0.5 are considered clinically meaningful.</description>

    <description>To further investigate the efficacy of AZD1402 at different dose levels compared to placebo in asthmatics who are uncontrolled on medium dose ICS-LABA. The SGRQ is a 50-item instrument developed to measure the health status of participants with airway obstruction diseases. The questionnaire is divided into 2 parts: part 1 consists of 8 items pertaining to the severity of respiratory symptoms in the preceding 4 weeks; part 2 consists of 42 items related to the daily activity and psychosocial impacts of the individual's respiratory condition. The SGRQ yields a total score and 3 domain scores (symptoms, activity, and impacts). The total score indicates the impact of disease on overall health status. This total score is expressed as a percentage of overall impairment, in which 100 represents the worst possible health status and 0 indicates the best possible health status. Likewise, the domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of greater impairment.</description>

Asthma symptom scores during night-time and day-time will be assessed by the participant each morning and evening according to the following scoring system:&#xD;
0: You have no asthma symptoms.&#xD;
You are aware of your asthma symptoms but you can easily tolerate the symptoms.&#xD;
Your asthma is causing you enough discomfort to cause problems with normal activities (or with sleep).&#xD;
You are unable to do your normal activities (or to sleep) because of your asthma.&#xD;

To investigate the effect of AZD1402 on airway inflammation, the measurement of FeNO will be performed in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines. Standardised conditions with regard to exhalation flow rate and duration of exhalation will be followed such that plateau definition can be evaluated over a minimum of 3 seconds.
