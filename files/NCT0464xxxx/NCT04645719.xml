  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium sulfate has been shown to be a successful tool in a large number of clinical areas.&#xD;
      Its benefits include neuroprotection, control of eclampsia / pre-eclampsia, control of&#xD;
      intraoperative blood pressure, decreased neuroendocrine response during laryngoscopy and&#xD;
      tracheal intubation and reduced levels of postoperative pain and consumption of analgesic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese patients have become more and more frequent in the operating rooms, due to the&#xD;
      increasing prevalence of this population worldwide. However, although they have received&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate as part of the analgesic strategy in many centers, there has been no study&#xD;
      demonstrating the appropriate dose of this medication in obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare two doses of magnesium sulfate in obese patients: based on their&#xD;
      real weight or based on ideal weight.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After approval by the Research Ethics Committee and registration of the project at&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials (www.ClinicalTrials.gov) 75 patients will be selected from a population of&#xD;
      obese patients scheduled for laparoscopic, bariatric or cholecystectomy surgery, who&#xD;
      voluntarily accept to participate in the study. These participants will be distributed&#xD;
      through an electronic draw in three groups. In the lactate ringer group (LRG), patients who&#xD;
      will receive only general anesthesia will be grouped. In the real weight group (RWG) will be&#xD;
      the patients who will receive general anesthesia and magnesium sulfate infused at a dose of&#xD;
      15 mg.kg-1.h-1 based on the actual body weight. In the corrected ideal weight group (CWG)&#xD;
      will be the patients who will receive general anesthesia and the same dose of magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate, but based on the corrected ideal weigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: patients aged 18 to 60 years, status I or II of the American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiology, body mass index&gt; 30 kg.m-2, scheduled for laparoscopic, bariatric surgery or&#xD;
      cholecystectomy. Patients with allergies to any of the components of the protocol, who refuse&#xD;
      to participate or sign the consent form, presenting neuromuscular impairment, heart block&#xD;
      greater than first-degree atrioventricular block, using illicit drugs, with neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      impairment, in blockers calcium channels and with renal impairment will not be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-trial phase will include 10 patients with a body mass index between 20 and 30 kg / m².&#xD;
      These patients will receive magnesium sulfate infusion at a dose of 15 mg.kg-1h-1, and serial&#xD;
      samples will be collected (before administration, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after&#xD;
      administration) for comparison with the trial patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the sample size was determined to a level of 95% confidence, power equal to&#xD;
      80% and effect size of 0.40, a sample of 22 individuals was calculated for each of the 3&#xD;
      groups, adding a total of 66 participants. We rounded up to 25 participants per group to&#xD;
      compensate for losses, with a total of 75 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of the group draw will be kept hidden for participants and the team. Each&#xD;
      participant will have an opaque envelope with their name and number corresponding to the&#xD;
      order of entry into the study. The group each patient belongs to and the medication to be&#xD;
      administered according to the group will be described on an identification card inside the&#xD;
      envelope. A team member will be responsible for opening the envelope and preparing the&#xD;
      medication to be administered, keeping the secret to the other study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not receive pre-anesthetic medication. Upon arriving at the operating room,&#xD;
      they will be monitored with continuous electrocardioscope, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure and monitoring of the level of consciousness. When the venous catheter is installed,&#xD;
      the first blood sample (2 ml) will be collected to measure blood magnesium concentration.&#xD;
      After blood collection, an infusion of the study comparison solution will be started as&#xD;
      described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LRG - Ringer with lactate 16 ml.h-1 RWG - magnesium sulfate 15 mg.kg-1.h-1 based on the&#xD;
      patient's real weight CWG - magnesium sulfate 15 mg / kg / h based on the patient's corrected&#xD;
      ideal weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A professional will be assigned to prepare the syringe and pump to administer the substance&#xD;
      in a covered manner to the patient and other team members. The infusion will be stopped at&#xD;
      the end of the surgery. The professional who deals with the pump and substance corresponding&#xD;
      to the patient's group will not participate in another stage of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of induction, all participants in the 3 groups will receive dipyrone 10 mg.kg-1,&#xD;
      clonidine 2 µg.kg-1, cefazolin 2 g, dexamethasone 4 mg, ketoprofen 100 mg, ranitidine 50 mg,&#xD;
      lidocaine 1.5 mg.kg-1. Pre-oxygenation with inspired fraction of 100% oxygen will be&#xD;
      initiated for 3 min, followed by propofol in target-controlled infusion (TCI - target&#xD;
      controlled infusion) with initial target at 4 µg.ml-1 (pharmacokinetic model Marsh, with&#xD;
      target effect) guided by the monitoring of anesthetic depth. At that moment, the muscle&#xD;
      relaxation monitor (TOF - train of four) will be calibrated, followed by the administration&#xD;
      of 0.1 mg of cisatracurium and the start of remifentanil infusion in TCI to an effect&#xD;
      concentration of 5 ng.ml-1. Anesthesia maintenance will be based on propofol in TCI guided by&#xD;
      anesthetic depth monitoring, remifentanil (target 3 to 5 ng.ml-1) and cisatracurium 0.03&#xD;
      mg.kg-1 if TOF ≥ 2. There will be no additional dose of cisatracurium in the last 20 minutes&#xD;
      surgery, unless necessary by the surgeon. The infusion of remifentanil will be controlled to&#xD;
      prevent systolic blood pressure from reaching values greater than or less than 30% of&#xD;
      baseline values, or a maximum of 130 mmHg and a minimum of 90 mmHg. At the end of surgery,&#xD;
      after TOF&gt; 2, patients will receive atropine 20 µg.kg-1 and neostigmine 40 µg.kg-1. Blood&#xD;
      will be collected to examine the blood concentration of magnesium in all patients in the 3&#xD;
      groups at the time of venipuncture and 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after the beginning of the&#xD;
      covered solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before extubation, all patients will receive an intravenous dose of morphine 0.05 mg.kg-1 and&#xD;
      dipyrone 10 mg.kg-1. Five minutes after extubation, and then every 30 min, this dose of&#xD;
      morphine will be repeated in case of pain greater than 3 on the verbal pain scale (scale from&#xD;
      0 to 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be recorded and analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood concentrations of magnesium at the moments described&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Consumption of painkillers upon awakening and during hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cisatracurium latency (from injection to TOF = 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cisatracurium duration 25 (from injection to TOF = 25%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Total duration of cisatracurium (from injection to TOF = 90%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cisatracurium recovery index (between TOF 25% and 75%)&#xD;
