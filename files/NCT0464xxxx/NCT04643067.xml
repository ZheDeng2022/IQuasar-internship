&#xD;
               -  Anti-Smith antibody elevated to above normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have 2 negative serum pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to&#xD;
                  starting study therapy, 1 at Screening and again within 3 days before taking the&#xD;
                  first dose of KPG-818, then have a negative urine pregnancy test at Baseline&#xD;
                  before dosing. WOCBP must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of&#xD;
                  the study and after end of study treatment. This applies even if the patient&#xD;
                  practices true abstinence from heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be&#xD;
                  reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use 2 forms of&#xD;
                  reliable contraception simultaneously. One must be a highly effective method and&#xD;
                  1 additional effective (barrier) method (see Appendix 5 for more details), and&#xD;
                  both must be practiced without interruption, at least 28 days before starting&#xD;
                  investigational medicinal product (IMP), during the study therapy (including dose&#xD;
                  interruptions), and for 28 days after discontinuation of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male patients must: Practice true abstinence or agree to use a barrier contraception&#xD;
             (male latex condom or non-latex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for&#xD;
             example, polyurethane]) during sexual contact with WOCBP while participating in the&#xD;
             study, and for at least 90 days following IMP discontinuation, even if he has&#xD;
             undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients must agree not to donate semen or&#xD;
             sperm during the treatment period and for at least 90 days following the&#xD;
             discontinuation of KPG-818.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female patients who are postmenopausal must demonstrate a follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
             (FSH) blood levels of equal or greater than 40 mIU/mL at the Screening visit. Women&#xD;
             aged &gt; 60 years old whose FSH values are not equal or greater than 40 mIU/mL may be&#xD;
             included at the discretion of the Investigator and in consultation with the Sponsor&#xD;
             (see Appendix 5 for more details).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. All patients must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Understand that KPG-818 could have potential teratogenic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree not to share KPG-818 with another person.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Be counseled about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure as described&#xD;
                  in the Pregnancy Prevention Plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. In Phase 2a part of the study, the patient must be on stable standard care of SLE&#xD;
             treatment with at least one of the followings: oral corticosteroid, anti-malarial, or&#xD;
             immunosuppressant:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. If taking OCS, must be on-treatment for ≥ 4 weeks before the Screening visit, and&#xD;
                  maintained on a stable dose of ≤ 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for at&#xD;
                  least 4 weeks before the Baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If taking an anti-malarial agent (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, or&#xD;
                  quinacrine), must be on-treatment for ≥ 8 weeks before the Screening visit and be&#xD;
                  on a stable dose for ≥ 4 weeks before the Screening visit. Anti-malarials at the&#xD;
                  following doses are allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hydroxychloroquine (≤ 400 mg/day)&#xD;
&#xD;

               3. If taking allowed immunosuppressants, must be on-treatment for ≥ 8 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  the Screening visit and be on a stable dose for ≥ 4 weeks before the Screening&#xD;
                  visit. Only 1 of the immunosuppressants below is allowed at the indicated doses:&#xD;
&#xD;

               4. If taking NSAIDs or other regularly administered analgesics, these will be&#xD;
                  allowed if treatment started ≥ 4 weeks before the Baseline visit and dosing has&#xD;
                  not been changed within the last 2 weeks before the Baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. If immunosuppressants, anti-malarial, or OCS is discontinued, the last dose must&#xD;
                  be more than 4 weeks prior to Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients must agree not to donate blood (or any component of blood) from 3 months&#xD;
             before Screening until 3 months after the last dose of KPG-818.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients must be willing to comply with precautions to reduce the risk of COVID-19&#xD;
             infection in accordance with recommendations from the applicable medical associations&#xD;
             and the Investigator for the duration of the study, and to undergo COVID-19 polymerase&#xD;
             chain reaction (PCR) test as required based on the Investigator judgment and/or local&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria are listed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must be off prohibited medications for a pre-specified period of time (see Appendix 6&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. History of antiphospholipid syndrome with thromboembolic event within 12 months of&#xD;
             screening or not on an adequate anticoagulation regimen. However, presence of&#xD;
             antiphospholipid antibodies alone (without a history of thromboembolic event) is not&#xD;
             exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Other non-SLE driven inflammatory joint or skin disease, mixed connective tissue&#xD;
             disease, scleroderma, and/or overlap syndromes. An exception may be allowed for&#xD;

             after a discussion with the medical monitor. Patients with SLE and secondary Sjogren&#xD;
             syndrome are not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Clinically significant or unstable or uncontrolled acute or chronic disease not&#xD;
             related to SLE that in the Investigator's opinion would preclude patient&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Concomitant condition (such as asthma) that required systemic corticosteroid use&#xD;
             within 1 year before Screening. Use of inhaled corticosteroid is not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. History of alcohol or drug abuse within 1 year before screening based on the&#xD;
             Investigator's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Have a positive urine drug test at screening (see Appendix 3) except if the patient&#xD;
             has a valid prescription for an allowed concomitant medication or substance&#xD;
             abuse/dependence has been ruled out in the Investigator's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. History of major surgery within 12 weeks prior to Screening or any planned major&#xD;
             surgery during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities or have a corrected QT (QTc) interval value &gt;&#xD;
             480 ms at Screening, in the Investigator's opinion would preclude patient&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Pregnant or breastfeeding female.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Signs or symptoms that in the opinion of the Investigator, may be suggestive of&#xD;
             COVID-19 infection. The patient may be allowed to enter the study if a COVID-19 PCR&#xD;
             test performed during the Screening results in a negative outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Known allergic reaction to any of the ingredients for study drug or placebo.&#xD;
