  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial examining whether Baylis's Versacross RF wire versus&#xD;
      the conventional Baylis RF needle is better at puncturing through a thin wall in the heart&#xD;
      (called &quot;transseptal puncture&quot;) as measured by time to successful transseptal puncture,&#xD;
      during cardiac ablation procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transseptal puncture is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the cardiac&#xD;
      electrophysiology and interventional cardiology laboratories. Indeed, every atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation ablation, now the predominant electrophysiology procedure performed throughout&#xD;
      the world, routinely involves two different transseptal puncture procedures. The&#xD;
      investigators previously performed a randomized, comparative effectiveness trial&#xD;
      demonstrating the superiority (in both efficacy and safety) of a radiofrequency (RF)&#xD;
      transseptal needle versus the conventional sharp-tipped mechanical needle. More recently, an&#xD;
      alternative approach to transseptal puncture has been FDA approved and is already utilized as&#xD;
      part of standard of care in these procedures. With this new approach, a J-shaped wire that&#xD;
      can transmit RF energy is advanced inside the transeptal sheath rather than the more stiff RF&#xD;
      or conventional needle. As advancing a wire is usually a step employed in any transseptal&#xD;
      procedure (then usually requiring removal of that wire and then placement of the needle),&#xD;
      this new approach saves a step. In addition once the wire has been advanced across the&#xD;
      intra-atrial septum into the left atrium, the wire can be used to avoid potentially severe&#xD;
      complications; specifically, after a transseptal needle is advanced across the left atrium,&#xD;
      advancing the sheath over the needle can result in a sudden jump of all the equipment,&#xD;
      risking perforation of the far left atrial wall. With the wire approach, the wire can be&#xD;
      safely advanced into a pulmonary vein so that even if the sheath and dilator jump suddenly&#xD;
      across the septum, they will be guided along the wire and thereby avoid perforation. The&#xD;
      investigators will be studying patients undergoing a catheter ablation procedure at&#xD;
      University of California, San Francisco.&#xD;
