      Normative data values of handgrip strength not only describes hand normality but is also used&#xD;
      as an objective assessor of upper extremities damages for Occupational Therapy and Physical&#xD;
      Therapy interventions. Published normative data of different populations are widely available&#xD;
      and can be used as reference. It is evident from different researches that various&#xD;
      anthropometric variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, nutritional status, shoulder&#xD;
      circumference &amp; Body Mass Index(BMI), type of occupation and hand dominance of any population&#xD;
      influence the hand muscles grip strength. Whereas, some literature shows disparity over the&#xD;
      correlation between hand grip strength and BMI, several researchers claiming a positive&#xD;
      relationship between BMI and grip strength in all ages of both genders, while other indicates&#xD;
      no relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 3000 volunteers will be recruited from the staff, medical students, and&#xD;
      visitors of different medical college &amp; universities of Lahore. Subjects will be excluded if&#xD;
      they had a history of upper-limb injury or deformity, or related health conditions.&#xD;
      Socioeconomic background, general health, and lifestyle of the subjects will be assessed&#xD;
      using a standard questionnaire. Weight, height &amp; APM thickness will be measured prior to&#xD;
      testing. Correlation between Hand Grip Strength and age, weight, height, body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), and Adductor Polices Muscle Thickness (APMT) will be measured. Multiple linear&#xD;
      regression analysis will be used to adjust for the effects of other variables and to identify&#xD;
      those independently associated with Hand grip strength. All the analysis will be carried out&#xD;
      on SPSS v 25.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the last 20 years, a number of scientific publications from around the world point to&#xD;
      hospital malnutrition as a direct cause for higher morbidity (slower wound healing; higher&#xD;
      hospital infection rates; longer stay, especially among intensive care patients; higher&#xD;
      readmission rates) and mortality. The obvious impact of such a scenario include avoidable&#xD;
      deaths, additional costs for the social security system, and the social onus related to loss&#xD;
      of working days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide variety of methods are available for nutritional evaluation. Not with standing, none&#xD;
      of these can currently be considered as a ''gold-standard'' for diagnosing hospital&#xD;
      malnutrition. Available methods include anthropometry, the creatinine height index, albumin,&#xD;
      pre-albumin, immuno competence evaluation, cholesterol, and the prognostic nutritional index,&#xD;
      among others. However, none of these methods provides a functional evaluation of&#xD;
      malnutrition. SGA is a well-accepted method of nutritional assessment that addresses&#xD;
      functional status as a complement of its medical history, but it was not developed to be used&#xD;
      to evaluate responsiveness, and so, its rating are not expected to show any modification&#xD;
      after nutritional interventions in short periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that muscular function is altered and muscular strength diminished, in the&#xD;
      presence of malnutrition. According to Jeejeebhoy, malnutrition-related muscular function&#xD;
      alterations appear before changes in anthropometric and laboratory parameters. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      methods for evaluating muscular strength during nutritional evaluation are still scarce. The&#xD;
      earliest nutritional alterations occur within muscle cells, and have an effect on muscle cell&#xD;
      function. Measuring muscular strength may therefore provide a sensitive method for&#xD;
      nutritional evaluation. Muscular loss is inevitable during malnutrition, and if untreated,&#xD;
      may become progressive. Therefore, in addition to their ability to detect early alterations&#xD;
      related to malnutrition, muscular function tests could also prove useful for evaluating&#xD;
      nutritional recovery, underscoring the importance of such evaluation in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have demonstrated the validity of using hand dynamometers as a method for&#xD;
      nutritional evaluation, given that this is a simple, fast, useful, inexpensive, and&#xD;
      efficacious test for muscular function. Knowledge of reference values in a healthy population&#xD;
      would allow a functional muscle evaluation not only in hospital and research settings, but&#xD;
      also in population-based studies. The aim of the study is to determine reference values and&#xD;
      associated factors for hand grip strength in healthy individuals.&#xD;
