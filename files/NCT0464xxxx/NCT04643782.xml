      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the ANNETM One system for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults. Our primary hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      ANNETM One system is non-inferior compared to polysomnography (PSG) for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea. Our secondary hypothesis is that the ANNETM One system is&#xD;
      non-inferior to home sleep apnea tests (HST) in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea for&#xD;
      patients who qualified for HST. Exploratory objectives include assessment of the diagnostic&#xD;
      yield of the ANNETM One system worn over multiple sequential nights, repeatability of&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) calculations over multiple nights, and the predictive value of&#xD;
      pulse arrival time to detect obstructive, central, and mixed apnea and hypopnea events.&#xD;
