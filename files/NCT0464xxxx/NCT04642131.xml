  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown the positive effect that caffeine has on athletic performance&#xD;
      related variables. Nonetheless, most studies have been developed in males and have not&#xD;
      studied the possible effects on biomechanics and related injuries. Moreover, the inclusion of&#xD;
      personalized insoles could also affect biomechanical patterns and thus injury incidence that&#xD;
      has shown to be higher when athletes are fatigued. Therefore, the aim of the present&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of fatigue, caffeine supplementation&#xD;
      and personalized insoles on biomechanics and athletic performance in female adult soccer&#xD;
      players.&#xD;
