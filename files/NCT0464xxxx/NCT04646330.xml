    <textblock>
      This trial is a single arm, two cohorts, phase Ib/II study. All patients are stage IIIB/C or&#xD;
      IV NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1. Cohort 1 includes&#xD;
      treatment naïve patients with advanced NSCLC. Cohort 2 includes patients with metastatic or&#xD;
      recurrent NSCLC after progression on treatment with PD-1/PD-L1. The primary end point are&#xD;
      objective response rate per RECIST1.1 and safety. Secondary end points are progression-free&#xD;
      survival and overall survival.&#xD;
