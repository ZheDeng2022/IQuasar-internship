  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to establish the safety and efficacy of treating patients with inoperable&#xD;
      oesophageal cancer or gastric cancer, using an endoscopic electroporation system (EndoVE) to&#xD;
      facilitate direct chemotherapy tumour absorption.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of electroporation has expanded over the last twenty years since its first clinically&#xD;
      reported study in the treatment of head and neck cancer in 1991.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In electroporation short high-voltage pulses are delivered directly to the tumour which&#xD;
      transiently permeabilises the cell membranes enabling targeted cell death and also allowing&#xD;
      otherwise non-permeant chemotherapeutic drugs to enter the cancer cells. The parameters of a&#xD;
      successful electroporation process are determined by the strength of the electric field and&#xD;
      the duration of the electrical field exposure. ePORE and EndoVE deliver electroporation&#xD;
      parameters which successfully electroporate cells in the reversible electroporation range,&#xD;
      whilst eliminating muscular contractions. Both devices are CE marked and will be used within&#xD;
      the definition of their intended use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently over 150 sites in Europe are reported to be employing electroporation in the&#xD;
      clinical management of head &amp; neck, recurrent breast, malignant melanoma, colorectal, liver&#xD;
      metastasis, pancreatic and inoperable glioma. The standard operating procedures for&#xD;
      electroporation and electrochemotherapy were established during the EU funded ESOPE study&#xD;
      which established the clinical application of electroporation in combination with cisplatin&#xD;
      or bleomycin. The EndoVE device has already been used successfully in phase I studies in&#xD;
      patients with inoperable oesophageal and colorectal cancer. No serious adverse events were&#xD;
      noted with positive tumour regression observed after a single treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient recruited to the study will be requested to attend a pre-study visit where informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained before proceeding to review medical history and conduct a full&#xD;
      clinical examination, full blood count, EKG and assessment of tumour volume via a CT. The&#xD;
      procedure will happen no later than 28 days after the pre-study visit - Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the procedure, a review of any changes which occurred since the pre-study visit&#xD;
      will be conducted. The patient will be placed under General Anaesthetic or sedated before&#xD;
      Bleomycin will be delivered intravenously. The patient will then be treated endoscopically&#xD;
      with the EndoVE device. The EndoVE procedure should take no longer than 30 minutes. The&#xD;
      patient will then be transferred to the step-down ward to monitor for any adverse events&#xD;
      before being discharged. There will be a telephone follow up after 2 days, 7 days, 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 8 weeks. The patient will be requested to attend the clinic for a 12-week follow up for&#xD;
      clinical review,&#xD;
