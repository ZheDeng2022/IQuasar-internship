  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      459 adult patients who received a hemithyroidectomy at the Department of General Surgery,&#xD;
      Division of Endocrine Surgery and a follow-up visit (3-12 months post-surgery) at the thyroid&#xD;
      outpatient clinic of the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Medical University of&#xD;
      Vienna between 1994 and 2018 were identified and investigated in this retrospective study.&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients post right side hemithyroidectomy&#xD;
      require a higher mean levothyroxine dosage than patients after left lobe hemithyroidectomy as&#xD;
      the right thyroid lobe is bigger than the left lobe. Further, we aimed at developing a better&#xD;
      post-surgery thyroid dosage prediction model.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most patients, the right lobe of the thyroid gland is larger than the left lobe. After a&#xD;
      hemithyroidectomy, the remaining lobe grows by up to 30% to compensate for the loss. However,&#xD;
      thyroxine replacement is still necessary for 22% to 60% of all patients. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate whether a right-lobe hemithyroidectomy predisposes to a higher&#xD;
      postoperative dose of levothyroxine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods In a retrospective cohort study, 459 patients over the age of 18 years&#xD;
      who underwent a hemithyroidectomy at the Department of General Surgery, Division of Endocrine&#xD;
      Surgery and a follow-up (3-12 months post-surgery) visit at the thyroid outpatient clinic of&#xD;
      the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism between 1994 and 2018 were investigated. The&#xD;
      study was approved by the local ethics committee and performed in accordance with the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki. The work has been reported in line with the STROCSS criteria. The&#xD;
      patients were identified via data extraction from a university hospital-wide Research,&#xD;
      Documentation and Analysis (RDA) database. In a second step, further information necessary&#xD;
      for the analysis (ultrasound data on pre-surgery thyroid volume, pre-surgery TSH, side and&#xD;
      date of hemithyroidectomy, surgery protocol, underlying thyroid disease, type and dosage of&#xD;
      treatment, age, weight, height, thyrotropin (TSH), free T4 (fT4), free T3 (fT3)) were&#xD;
      extracted from the internal electronic health record system. Patients who had either received&#xD;
      radiation therapy had undergone previous thyroid surgery, surgery on the contralateral lobe,&#xD;
      had pre-existing hypothyroidism, an autoimmune disease of the thyroid or were pregnant were&#xD;
      excluded from the analysis. 33 patients were excluded due to additional surgery on the&#xD;
      contralateral lobe resulting in a total of 426 patients. Pre-surgery ultrasound thyroid&#xD;
      volume was calculated with the volumetric ellipsoid method (height × width × depth ×&#xD;
      correction factor 0.524).&#xD;
