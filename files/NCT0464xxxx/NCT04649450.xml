      Rationale: Delirium is a common and severe complication after neurosurgical procedures. Music&#xD;
      before, during and after surgical procedures has proven its effectiveness in reducing pain,&#xD;
      anxiety, stress and opioid medication in surgical patients. These symptoms belong to the main&#xD;
      eliciting factors for developing delirium. Effective preventive therapy for delirium is not&#xD;
      available. The investigators hypothesize that music listening, being a sustainable&#xD;
      intervention with negligible risk of side effects, can lower delirium incidence among&#xD;
      neurosurgical patients, resulting in reduction of in-hospital stays, healthcare costs and&#xD;
      post-operative morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the effect of peri-operative music on post-operative delirium in&#xD;
      patients undergoing a craniotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single-centre prospective randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients undergoing a craniotomy at the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Recorded music, with headphones or earphones, before, during and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Diagnosis of post-operative delirium screened by the DOS&#xD;
      score confirmed by the consultant psychiatrist following the DSM-V criteria.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is a common and severe complication after neurosurgical procedures. Music before,&#xD;
      during and after surgical procedures has proven its effectiveness in reducing pain, anxiety,&#xD;
      stress and opioid medication in surgical patients. These symptoms belong to the main&#xD;
      eliciting factors for developing delirium. Effective preventive therapy for delirium is not&#xD;
      available. The investigators hypothesize that music listening, being a sustainable&#xD;
      intervention with negligible risk of side effects, can lower delirium incidence among&#xD;
      neurosurgical patients, resulting in reduction of in-hospital stays, healthcare costs and&#xD;
      post-operative morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of peri-operative music on post-operative delirium in patients&#xD;
      undergoing a craniotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis effect and sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect an incidence of delirium in our control group of 30%. This is based&#xD;
      on literature documenting incidence of delirium in neurosurgical patients in a northern&#xD;
      European population of 29-33%.The expected effect cannot be based on previous literature&#xD;
      since no adequate trials exist on the effect of music on delirium. Other non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions in delirium prevention mention a relative reduction of 36-77%. The&#xD;
      investigators will consider the intervention clinical relevant if a relative reduction of 60%&#xD;
      with an absolute reduction of 18% is achieved. Taking into account the incidence of delirium&#xD;
      of 30%, a power of 80%, a two-sided significant p-value of &lt;0,05 in a 1:1 randomization leads&#xD;
      to a sample size of 90 patients per arm. The investigators expect a loss to follow-up of 5%&#xD;
      and will therefore include 189 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated to either the intervention (music) or control (standard&#xD;
      care) group. Participants in the music group will receive headphones with music 30 minutes&#xD;
      before surgery. Patients will be able to choose music from a preselected list composed by a&#xD;
      team consisting of researchers and dedicated music therapists. The headphones will be removed&#xD;
      just before entering the operating room. Once in the operating room they will receive&#xD;
      earphones after intubation, compatible with the Mayfield and site of operation. The&#xD;
      intraoperative music intervention will be continued during the surgical procedure and&#xD;
      discontinued just before detubation. The duration of the intraoperative music intervention&#xD;
      depends on the duration of surgery and will be documented. After surgery, during recovery at&#xD;
      the post-operative care unit (PACU) another 30 minutes of music through headphones will be&#xD;
      given. The following 3 days at the neurosurgical ward they will receive music twice per day&#xD;
      for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The primary outcome measure is presence or absence of postoperative delirium&#xD;
      within the first 5 days after surgery. All participating patients on the ward will be&#xD;
      screened using the Delirium Observation Screening (DOS) scale. Additional to the DOS, in case&#xD;
      of raised suspicion of delirium, a psychiatrist is consulted to confirm or reject clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of delirium based on the DSM-V criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Severity and duration of delirium (DRS-R-98)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative anxiety (VAS-A)&#xD;

    <measure>Delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>First five post-operative days. In case of discharge within 5 days towards home without delirium, it will be considered as no delirium.</time_frame>
    <description>All participating patients on the ward will be screened using the Delirium Observation Screening (DOS) scale. The DOS is a score of 1 until 13, in which a score of 3 or higher is suspicious for delirium. Screening is conducted 3 times per day (i.e. during each shift) and maintained until day 5. In case of raised suspicion of delirium by DOS, a psychiatrist is consulted to confirm or reject clinical diagnosis of delirium based on the DSM-V criteria. Presence of delirium is confirmed by the psychiatrist after positive DOS screening, all other patients will be considered as absence of delirium. In case of discharge towards another hospital within 5 days, onset of delirium is evaluated in that hospital. In case of discharge within 5 days towards home without delirium, it will be considered as no delirium.</description>

    <measure>Severity and duration of delirium.</measure>
    <time_frame>First five days or discharge. In case of positive delirium until it has 'faded out'.</time_frame>
    <description>In case of positive delirium, its severity will be assessed using the Delirium Rating Scale-revised-98 (DRS-R-98). DSR-98 regards a 13-item score sheet in which 0 represents the lowest and 39 represents the highest severity. It will be assessed by the consultant psychiatrist on the day of onset of delirium. Subsequently, as long as the delirium lasts the severity is assessed once every three days (i.e. Monday, Wednesday and Friday). To assess duration of delirium, the DOS score will be used; a DOS &lt;3 during 24 hours will be considered as a 'faded out' delirium and number of days from onset until end will be documented.</description>

The EORTC QLQ-C30, an approach for evaluating the Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in international cancer clinical trials, incorporates nine multi-item scales: five functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional and Social Functioning); three symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain and Nausea/Vomiting); and a Global Health Status/QoL scale. Six single item scales are also included (Dyspnoea, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhoea and Financial Difficulties). Items are presented as questions on a scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;very much.&quot;</description>
