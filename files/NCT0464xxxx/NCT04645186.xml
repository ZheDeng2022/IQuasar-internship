  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, non-randomised, post market clinical follow-up study&#xD;
      to compile clinical data on performance and safety of the synthetic bone graft substitute and&#xD;
      to assess that the performance and safety of the device are maintained until the reaching of&#xD;
      its intended use in a commercial clinical setting in long bone and extremity defects.&#xD;
