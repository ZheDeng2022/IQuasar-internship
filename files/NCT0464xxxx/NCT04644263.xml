      Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Turkish&#xD;
      version of the 'The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia for Temporomandibular Disorders (TSK-TMD)'&#xD;
      questionnaire used to assess kinesiophobia in temporomandibular joint disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The &quot;Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale in Temporomandibular Disorders&quot; (TSK-TMD), which&#xD;
      consists of 12 item, was adapted to Turkish with the translation and back-translation method.&#xD;
      111 patients (75 females, 36 males) who had been diagnosed with temporomandibular joint for&#xD;
      at least 6 months and diagnosed as Temporomandibular Joint Disorder were participated to fill&#xD;
      out the questionnaire. In the present study, participants were assessed with the&#xD;
      Temporomandibular joint disorders evaluation form, Turkish TSK-TMD-12 item, Visuel Analogue&#xD;
      Scale (VAS) and Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). The internal consistency and test-retest&#xD;
      reliability with a 3-5 days time were used to evaluate the reliability of the TSK-TMD. The&#xD;
      reliability of the corelatıon was checked with PCS. Construct validity was assessed based on&#xD;
      conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA).&#xD;

    <measure>The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia for Temporomandibular Disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurement is one-time and take 20 minutes. It take an average of 6 month after the data of all participants are collected.</time_frame>
    <description>The original TSK-TMD is an English scale and consists of 18 items to evaluate the fear of movement in TMD patients. 4-point Likert type scoring is used (1-strongly disagree, 2-partially disagree, 3-partially agree and 4- strongly agree). Total score is calculated by reversing 4, 8, 12, 16 items. In this short form, by collecting all points, scores between 12-48 are obtained. The higher the person's score indicates, the higher the kinesiophobia. They suggested that the 12-item version had good reliability and validity as a result of the structural reliability assessment and was more suitable for evaluation in TMD patients.</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scala</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurement is one-time and take 15 minutes. It take an average of 6 month after the data of all participants are collected.</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale developed to detect catastrophic thoughts or feelings and ineffective coping methods of pain experienced by patients in the past. It describes the different thoughts and feelings that individuals can experience while suffering. PCS is a scale consisting of thirteen items and three factors such as helplessness, enlargement and self-reflection. Likert type scoring is evaluated between 0-4 points. The total score ranges from 0-52.</description>
