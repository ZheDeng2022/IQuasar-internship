  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure is a disease involving many different aspects of the human body, including&#xD;
      changes in metabolism, the way the body produces and uses energy. Research shows that&#xD;
      patients with heart failure often have a sleep disorder called sleep disordered breathing&#xD;
      (SDB). It has been shown that SDB is associated with poor outcomes in heart failure patients,&#xD;
      but the exact reason is unknown. It is likely that SDB leads to changes in metabolism and&#xD;
      hormone status in the body, which is especially dangerous for heart failure patients. There&#xD;
      is currently no treatment for SDB in heart failure patients. Recently, with Sodium glucose&#xD;
      co-transporter 2 (SGLT2)-Inhibitors a new drug class has been approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced heart failure. This drug has effects on the metabolism in heart failure patients,&#xD;
      among several other effects. This research project has the aim to investigate if SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitors can help in the treatment of SDB, as many mechanisms of the drug overlap with the&#xD;
      mechanisms how SDB develops. The drug has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of heart&#xD;
      failure. The investigators want to study the effect of the drug on SDB by using a home sleep&#xD;
      test called Watchpat, which has been approved to diagnose SDB.&#xD;

      To explore whether SGLT2-Inhibition has a beneficial effect on Sleep Disordered Breathing&#xD;
      (SDB) in advanced heart failure patients. This project proposes to carry out research that&#xD;
      addresses the established, but in clinical practice under-recognized association between&#xD;
      Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) and a worse prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF).&#xD;
      SDB is highly prevalent in the HF population. Multiple studies have shown that HF accompanied&#xD;
      by SDB is associated with an increased mortality compared to the absence of SDB. Two major&#xD;
      types of SDB are prevalent in HF: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Central Sleep Apnea&#xD;
      (CSA). Mechanistically, it has been proposed that SDB impacts the neurohumoral axis and&#xD;
      systemic metabolism and therefore has particularly detrimental effects on the HF patient&#xD;
      population. Therapeutic options for the treatment of SDB are limited. Heart Failure is a&#xD;
      multisystemic disease leading to maladaptive cardiac and systemic metabolic changes.&#xD;
      Recently, with SGLT2-Inhibitors a new drug class has been approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced heart failure. This is the first drug class in the HF drug armamentarium targeting&#xD;
      cardiometabolic mechanisms. This study seeks to improve the health of individuals with heart&#xD;
      failure by exploring whether SGLT2-Inhibition has a beneficial effect on SDB (OSA and CSA) in&#xD;
      advanced heart failure patients and therefore may be a novel therapeutic option for the&#xD;
      treatment of SDB in advanced HF. The specific aim of this project is to assess the effect of&#xD;
      therapy with a SGLT2-I on SDB in ambulatory advanced HF patients by using the&#xD;
      WatchPAT-derived apnea-hypopnea index as well as subjective measures of sleep quality using&#xD;
      the Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale.&#xD;

    <description>The Berlin Questionnaire for sleep apnea consists of 3 categories related to the risk of having sleep apnea. Participants are classified as &quot;High Risk&quot; or &quot;Low Risk&quot; for sleep apnea. High risk categorization is assigned when there are 2 or more categories where the score is positive (&quot;positive&quot; defined as a score of 2 or more points). Low risk categorization is assigned when there is 1 or no categories where the score is positive.</description>
