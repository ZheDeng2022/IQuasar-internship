  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to do translation, cross-cultural adaptation and&#xD;
      validation of the CISS and PWES questionnaire in French. No available translation exist in&#xD;
      French.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of the study, the investigators will use clinical guidelines for&#xD;
      translation and cross-cultural adaptation of questionnaire (Beaton and al).The content&#xD;
      validity will be evaluated also in this first step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study the French version of CISS and PWES (F-CISS and F-PWES) will&#xD;
      be validated. Different psychometric properties (internal consistency, test retest&#xD;
      reliability, construct validity, floor and ceiling effects) will be study. The investigators&#xD;
      use the recommendation of COSMIN (COnsensus- based Standards for the selection of health&#xD;
      Measurement INstruments) group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study in the first part has a cross-cultural adaptation design. The investigators will&#xD;
      use the CISS questionnaire modified by Ruijs, because the total score is between 0 and 100.&#xD;
      For the PWES questionnaire the investigators will use the original version .For translation&#xD;
      and cross-cultural adaptation, no consensus exists. The investigators choose the guidelines&#xD;
      of AAOS outcomes committee which are widely used and accepted in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following five steps will be documented in a written report: (1) forward translation from&#xD;
      English to French by two translators whose native language is French and fluent in English&#xD;
      (T1 and T2). One of the translators is informed about the aims of the study and the other&#xD;
      received only limited information (so-called naive translator).Moreover, none of the&#xD;
      translators are physicians. (2) Synthesis of T1 and T2 will be done to form a unique&#xD;
      translated version T12 by resolving any discrepancies under supervision of a methodologist&#xD;
      not involved in the translation process. (3) Back translation of the T12 version from French&#xD;
      to English by two English native speaking who are fluent in French (BT1 and BT2). These two&#xD;
      translators are naive to the study and not linked to the medical domain. (4) Consensus&#xD;
      meeting with all the involved subjects (translators, methodologist, specialist physicians in&#xD;
      rehabilitation) in order to resolve any discrepancies and doubts met during the translation&#xD;
      and to establish the pre final French version of the CISS and PWES (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will verify content validity which is the ability to an instrument to&#xD;
      reflect the domain of interest and the conceptual definition of a construct i.e. cold&#xD;
      intolerance. For this purpose, the instructions, response format and the items of F-CIIS and&#xD;
      F-PWES questionnaire will be evaluated by a panel of 10 people for conceptual equivalence&#xD;
      (clarity). The expert panel will have knowledge's about the content areas of the construct of&#xD;
      the questionnaire and the target population of the questionnaire. The mother language tongue&#xD;
      of the expert panel is French. The experts have to rate if instructions, response format and&#xD;
      items are clear or unclear. If unclear they are asked to provide suggestions for making the&#xD;
      language clearer. If instructions, response format and items are found to be unclear by at&#xD;
      least 20 % of the panel, they have to be revised. The minimum inter rater agreement among the&#xD;
      experts panel is 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the expert panel evaluate each item of the instrument for content equivalence, using the&#xD;
      following scale (1=not relevant, 2=somewhat relevant, 3=quite relevant, 4=highly relevant).&#xD;
      Items classified as 1 or 2 should be revised. Content validity index at the item level&#xD;
      (I-CVI) and at the scale level (S-CVI) should be calculated. The averaging calculation of&#xD;
      S-CVI (S-CVI/Ave) is the preferred method. With 10 experts, the I-CVI of 0.78 or above and an&#xD;
      S-CVI/Ave of 0.90 or above are the minimum acceptable indices. Items that do not achieve the&#xD;
      minimum acceptable indices are revised and re-evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part of the study which not concerned patients run from November 2019 to September 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre final French version of the CISS and PWES will be administered to French native speaking&#xD;
      patients suffering from various hand injuries. 30 patients are sufficient[50]. They will be&#xD;
      asked to write commentaries on difficulties of questionnaire's items, especially&#xD;
      comprehension of the different items (clear or unclear).If the item is considered unclear,&#xD;
      the patient is asked to provide suggestions for making the item clearer .An item considered&#xD;
      unclear by 20 % or more of the patients must be re-evaluated . The definitive version of&#xD;
      French-CISS and French PWES (F-CISS and F- PWES) and the verification of the different stages&#xD;
      of the cross-cultural adaptation will be validated during a new consensus meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second part (validation study) the investigators will administered F-CISS, F-PWES,&#xD;
      F-DASH, F-HFS, F-SF 36 questionnaires and a pain VAS to a population of 100 in and&#xD;
      outpatients with hand injuries. For F-CISS and F-PWES test-retest reliability, the first 50&#xD;
      patients consecutively included will be asked to answer questionnaires 7 days later .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to choose the cut-off of 30 points in the study to separate which&#xD;
      patient has a CI or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second part of the study, validation, different statistics will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For internal consistency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory factor analysis: 7 to 10 subjects per item are recommended with preference for a&#xD;
      sample ≥ 100 . To select the appropriate number of factors, many criteria might be used. We&#xD;
      can look at the screeplot, or take all components with an eigenvalue &gt; 1 (Kaiser Criterion).&#xD;
      To interpret the factors, an orthogonal varimax rotation will be applied. After that, items&#xD;
      will be associated with a given factor if their loadings are higher than 0.5 for the latter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of Cronbach's α for the entire questionnaire and for the different dimensions. A&#xD;
      Cronbach's α ≥0.70 for the entire questionnaire and for the subscales is required .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For test-retest reliability or reproducibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) are used. Since systematic difference is not&#xD;
      expected between test and retest, a two-way random effect model will be applied, so that&#xD;
      systematic difference are included in the measurement error. The investigators will study 50&#xD;
      patients with an interval of 7 days . The value of ICC should be &gt;0.70 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For construct validity: only the F-CISS will be studied. The F-PWES is only a scale for&#xD;
      screening people which are exposed to cold in their work and doesn't explore the same&#xD;
      dimensions. Pearson's correlation coefficient will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different hypotheses are posed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The F-CIIS is well correlated with the F-DASH. A correlation ≥ 0.5 is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The F-CISS is well correlated with the F-HFS. A correlation≥ 0.5 is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The F-CISS is well correlated with pain VAS. A correlation ≥ 0.5 is expected. For pain&#xD;
           VAS the question will be: when you are exposed to cold how much is your pain? We will&#xD;
           use a 100 mm horizontal VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The F-CISS is weakly correlated with SF36-PC. A correlation between 0.30 and 0.5 is&#xD;
           expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The F-CISS is not associated with SF36-MC. A correlation &lt; 0.3 is expected. To have a&#xD;
           good construct validity, 75 % of the hypotheses should be satisfied .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Floor or ceiling effects: the distribution of scores will be observed and the investigators&#xD;
      expected no floor or ceiling effects (less than 15 % of respondents achieved the highest or&#xD;
      lowest possible scores).&#xD;

        the studied population will be in and out patients. Inpatients are patients hospitalized&#xD;
        with hand injuries for a vocational rehabilitation in our clinic.. There are mainly men,&#xD;
