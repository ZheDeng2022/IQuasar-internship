  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is very frequent in general population (up to 10%). Nailfold&#xD;
      capillaroscopy (NFC) is recommended for patients presenting RP, to eliminate systemic disease&#xD;
      such as systemic sclerosis. NFC is not easily available in clinical practice. Dermoscopy,&#xD;
      used for pigmentary skin lesion screening, may help to detect giant loops, hemorrhages or&#xD;
      other capillaries anomalies. However, no study has evaluated the performance of dermoscopy in&#xD;
      primary RP. The objective is to determinate which items in dermoscopy are correlated with a&#xD;
      normal NFC and predict with a good negative predictive value, a normal NFC in RP patients.&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess inter-observer reproducibility of dermoscopy in patients&#xD;
      with RP.&#xD;

      Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is very frequent in general population (up to 10%). Nailfold&#xD;
      capillaroscopy (NFC) is recommended for patients presenting RP, to eliminate systemic disease&#xD;
      such as systemic sclerosis. NFC is not easily available in clinical practice. Dermoscopy,&#xD;
      used for pigmentary skin lesion screening, may help to detect giant loops, hemorrhages or&#xD;
      other capillaries anomalies. However, no study evaluated the performance of dermoscopy in&#xD;
      primary RP. A preliminary study (Tenon Hospital) showed an interest of dermoscopy in primary&#xD;
      and secondary RP, with a negative predictive value of dermoscopy of 100% for capillaroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicentric French study comparing dermoscopy and capillaroscopy in&#xD;
      patients attending dermatology or vascular medicine departments for the first evaluation of a&#xD;
      RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to determinate which items in dermoscopy are correlated with a normal NFC&#xD;
      and predict with a good negative predictive value, a normal NFC in RP patients. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to assess inter-observer reproducibility of dermoscopy in patients with RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that a normal dermocopy on five items is highly predictive of a normal&#xD;
      NFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a first consultation for RP, NFC will be realized with a clinical exam and a&#xD;
      biological test (antinuclear antibodies), as official recommendations. Dermoscopy of&#xD;
      peri-ungueal area will be realized by another investigator, if possible during the same&#xD;
      consultation. Photographs of all fingers, except thumbs, will be made and will be reviewed by&#xD;
      another investigator of another center. There will be no follow-up.&#xD;
