  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      will receive first line treatment with olaparib, pembrolizumab, and carboplatin. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that olaparib, pembrolizumab and carboplatin will result in an overall response&#xD;
      rate (ORR) higher than the historical ORR observed with pembrolizumab, platinum and 5-FU.&#xD;

    <description>-Patients enrolled in this study will receive olaparib, pembrolizumab and carboplatin in three-week cycles for six cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with three-week cycles of olaparib and pembrolizumab. Treatment will continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, patient or physician decision to stop therapy, or after 35 cycles, whichever occurs first. Drug dosing for each cycle is as follows:&#xD;
Olaparib 200 mg twice per day (bid) by mouth (po) Days 1-10 for the first six cycles (when given with carboplatin), followed by 400 mg bid po Days 1-21 of subsequent cycles.&#xD;
Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous (IV) Day 1.&#xD;
Carboplatin AUC 5 IV on Day 1 for up to six cycles.</description>
