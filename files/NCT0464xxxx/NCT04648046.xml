      This is a limited-center, open-label dose escalating phase I/IIa study of autologous T cells&#xD;
      expressing LVgp120duoCAR molecules in people with HIV infection. It will follow a 3+3 design.&#xD;
      Dose escalation decisions will be made when a minimum of three participants have completed&#xD;
      the safety-evaluation period (45 days) at a given dose level. Cohort 1 will undergo infusion&#xD;
      of a single low-dose regimen of LVgp120duoCAR-T cells. Cohort 2 will undergo non-ablative&#xD;
      conditioning with cyclophosphamide, followed by infusion of a single low-dose regimen of&#xD;
      LVgp120duoCAR-T cells. Cohort 3 will undergo non-ablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      followed infusion of a single high-dose regimen of LVgp120duoCAR-T cells. Following&#xD;
      administration of the experimental therapy, HIV medications will be paused for participants&#xD;
      in each group during an analytic treatment interruption.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A limited-center, open-label dose escalating phase I/IIa study of autologous T cells&#xD;
      expressing LVgp120duoCAR molecules will be performed. Participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      sequentially in up to three cohorts following a 3+3 design. Dose escalation decisions will be&#xD;
      made when a minimum of three participants have completed the safety-evaluation period (45&#xD;
      days) at a given dose level. No dose escalation will be allowed in an individual participant,&#xD;
      and participants who have dose limiting adverse events will reinstate ART therapy at first&#xD;
      available opportunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a 3+3 design, each cohort will enroll at least 3 participants. If there are no&#xD;
      safety issues with dosing in a cohort, the investigators will proceed to the following&#xD;
      cohort. If one participant in a cohort experiences a safety issue, an additional 3&#xD;
      individuals will be enrolled in that cohort to assess safety prior to proceeding to the next&#xD;
      cohort. See below for Dose Escalation Procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 3 participants start at Cohort 1. Data from Cohort 1 will be submitted for FDA&#xD;
      review prior to dosing Cohorts 2 and 3 to determine if cyclophosphamide conditioning is&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Participants will NOT undergo non-ablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide. A&#xD;
      single dose of 3 x 105 cells/kg LVgp120duoCAR-T cells will be infused. ART will be&#xD;
      interrupted immediately after infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Participants will undergo non-ablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide. A single&#xD;
      dose of 3 x 105 cells/kg LVgp120duoCAR-T cells will be infused. ART will be interrupted&#xD;
      immediately after infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: Participants will undergo non-ablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide. A single&#xD;
      dose of 1 x 106 cells/kg LVgp120duoCAR-T cells will be infused into the participant. ART will&#xD;
      be interrupted immediately after infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If, after 45 days of study treatment, no participant out of the initial 3 in a cohort&#xD;
           exhibits a study treatment-related DLT, then the next cohort of participants will be&#xD;
           treated at the subsequent cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If, after 45 days of study treatment, 1 participant out of the initial 3 in a cohort&#xD;
           exhibits a study treatment-related DLT, then up to 3 additional participants will be&#xD;
           added at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If no additional participant develops a study treatment-related DLT (i.e., 1/6&#xD;
           participants with DLT at that dose level), then the next cohort of participants will be&#xD;
           treated at the next higher dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. However, if a second participant develops a study treatment-related DLT, even if it is&#xD;
           before there are 6 total participants on that level, then the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
           (MTD) has been exceeded and no additional participants should be added to this or any&#xD;
           higher doses. A total of 6 participants should then be treated on the next lowest dose&#xD;
           level to ensure its tolerability and to better define the MTD. Thus, the MTD is defined&#xD;
           as the highest assigned dose level at which &lt; 2/6 participants have a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If 2 participants in Cohort 1 experience a related DLT, the MTD will have been exceeded&#xD;
           and no additional participants will be added at any higher level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If the investigators experience DLTs in Cohort 1, the investigators will de-escalate the&#xD;
           dose to 1 x 10^5 cells per kg. If the investigators experience DLTs at the de-escalated&#xD;
           dose of 1 x 10^5 cells per kg, the study will stop.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The clinical trial is an open-label dose escalating phase I/IIa study of autologous T cells expressing LVgp120duoCAR molecules that target and kill HIV-1 gp120 expressing cells. Participants will be enrolled sequentially in up to three sequentially enrolled cohorts in a 3+3 design. Dose escalation decisions will be made when a minimum of three participants have completed the safety-evaluation period (45 days) at a given dose level. No dose escalation will be allowed in an individual participant, and participants who have dose limiting adverse events will reinstate ART therapy at first available opportunity. There are 3 dose escalation cohorts with the first 3 participants starting at Cohort 1.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The primary safety outcome will be the number of participants reporting a new Grade 3 or greater adverse events assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, including signs/symptoms, lab toxicity or clinical event, that is definitely, probably, or possibly related to study treatment within 1 year of product administration.</description>

    <description>The primary efficacy outcome will be the proportion of individuals who achieve study-defined post-treatment control. The investigators will define post-treatment control in two ways. First, participants who fail to show any consistent rebound above 400 copies RNA/mL between Weeks 12 and Week 36 will be considered as having achieved post-treatment control. Second, participants who exhibit a rebound and eventually achieve 24 weeks of virus control will be considered as having achieved post-treatment control.</description>
