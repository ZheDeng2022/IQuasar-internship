  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Africa faces rapid urbanization, has the second highest population growth rate, makes up&#xD;
      one-fifth of the world's youth population, and experiences stagnant rates of undernutrition.&#xD;
      These challenges point to the need for country-specific data on rural-urban health&#xD;
      disparities to inform development policies. This cross-sectional study examined disparities&#xD;
      in body mass index-for-age-and-sex (BAZ) and height-for-age-and-sex z-scores (HAZ) among 1125&#xD;
      adolescents in Tanzania. Rural-urban disparities in nutritional status were significant and&#xD;
      gendered. Findings confirm place of residence as a key determinant of BAZ, HAZ, and stunting&#xD;
      among adolescents in Tanzania. Targeted gender-sensitive interventions among adolescents,&#xD;
      particularly in rural areas, are needed to limit growth faltering and improve health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      in body mass index-for-age-and-sex (BAZ) and height-for-age-and-sex z-scores (HAZ) among 1125&#xD;

      residence and undernutrition (BAZ &lt;-2SD), stunting (HAZ &lt;-2SD), anthropometric,&#xD;
      socioeconomic, and health indicators. Multivariate linear regression identified predictors of&#xD;
      BAZ and HAZ.&#xD;

        This cross-sectional study merged and analyzed two independent samples of adolescents&#xD;
        living in Tanzania. One study was conducted in Tanzania by Cordeiro et al. (2012) and the&#xD;
        other was conducted in an urban setting by Carlson, Brennan, and Earls (2012); both&#xD;
        conducted in 2004. The Kilosa/rural dataset was derived from a two-stage sampling plan for&#xD;
        selection of villages and adolescents. The Moshi/urban dataset was derived from a two-stage&#xD;
        sampling plan for a cluster randomized control trial (CRCT). From a total combined sample&#xD;
        of 1476 adolescents aged 10-19 years across both datasets, 1237 met the age criterion for&#xD;
        younger adolescents (10-14 years). The analytical sample for this study was 1125.&#xD;
