  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-period study, with an open-label, single-arm active treatment in Period 1&#xD;
      followed by a randomized-withdrawal, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design in Period 2,&#xD;
      and an open label, long-term safety follow-up in Period 3. The total study duration is&#xD;
      approximately 3 - 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Period 2, subjects will be randomized to MAS825 or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
