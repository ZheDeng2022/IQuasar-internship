  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to address whether topical gentamicin therapy is an&#xD;
      effective and feasible treatment. Specifically, we will investigate the effect of&#xD;
      non-intensive treatment (once daily or every other day) on skin protein expression, as well&#xD;
      as quantify the effect on wound healing in patients with EB caused by PSC (part A).&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will address in vitro whether gentamicin restores protein expression of genes&#xD;
      affected by SSM in fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies obtained from patients with EB&#xD;
      caused by SSM (part B). If these in vitro experiments yield positive results, the patients&#xD;
      donating the cells will be offered to enter part A of this study. The overall duration of&#xD;
      part A in this study is planned to be 18 weeks per patients and consists of a 6 weeks&#xD;
      treatment period followed by a 12 week follow up period. Each patient will attend 3 study&#xD;
      visits: at week 0, week 6 and week 18. All patients will be included within a time period of&#xD;
      12 months. The overall duration of part B will be up to 8 weeks per patients of which 4-7&#xD;
      weeks are spent to prepare fibroblasts obtained from skin biopsies. Then 5 days of in vitro&#xD;
      intervention and subsequent analysis follows. Altogether, the duration of the GENTELBULL&#xD;
      study will be 78 weeks or less.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has EB caused by nonsense mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has a symmetrical distribution of wounds which allows for wounds on one&#xD;
             side of the body to serve as control wounds, while study therapy is applied to the&#xD;
             other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient (if an adult) or parent(s)/guardian(s) is capable of giving signed&#xD;
             informed consent as described in Appendix 1 which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women of childbearing potential must use a highly effective contraception method&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known contact allergy against gentamicin sulfate or other ingredients in the ointment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known intolerance to gentamicin sulfate of any sort&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Moderate or severely reduced kidney function (eGFR &lt;45)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use other experimental therapy against EB&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Receiving systemic aminoglycosides during the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient uses muscle relaxant drug(s)&#xD;
