  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to validate a blood test that can identify safe foods for food&#xD;
      protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES). This study proposes a solution to the&#xD;
      problems of FPIES by developing a new blood assay that screens a large number of foods (more&#xD;
      than 20) in a culture plate. If this blood test is successful it may be able to identify safe&#xD;
      foods more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit ten participants that will have 2-3 trigger foods as well as ten&#xD;
      participants with 4 or more trigger foods.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will complete surveys and have blood draws during the study. Additionally,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to keep track of their diet as well as introduce safe foods&#xD;
      identified by the researchers.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 10 weeks (from first food trial)</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will build a Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to estimate the NPV. A random-effects logit model will be used to model the binary outcome (safe or trigger food) as a function of the 9 biomarker measurements in the assay. The random effect in the logit model will take into consideration of the correlated data measured within the same subject. A cluster Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will be used to assess the precision of the assay. Specifically, the study team will compute the area under the cluster ROC curve (AUC), along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The assay is predictive if the lower limit of the 95% CI is above 0.5, which is the null value indicating no predictive ability.&#xD;
Given the assay is predictive, the team will select a threshold to obtain the NPV.</description>
