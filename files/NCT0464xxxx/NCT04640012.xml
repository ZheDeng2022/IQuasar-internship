  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of DC371739 after a&#xD;
      single-dose oral administration in healthy Chinese subjects, and to explore the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose, also the pharmacokinetics of urine and feces.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind , placebo-controlled, single-dose study in 43 male healthy&#xD;
      subjects assigned to one of the six dose groups (30mg、50mg、100mg、 200mg、400mg and 600mg).&#xD;
      30mg dose group is the pilot group with 3 subjects. Each of the other dose groups will&#xD;
      include 8 subjects (7 for DC371739 and 1 for placebo). Subjects will be admitted for&#xD;
      treatment on day -1 and receive a single dose of study drug or placebo on day 1. Subjects&#xD;
      from different dose groups were enrolled in turn, the next dose group was conducted on the&#xD;
      premise that the D6 safety evaluation was completed after the administration of the previous&#xD;
      dose group with the result was tolerance. Blood samples will be collected for each group&#xD;
      after administration for pharmacokinetic data analysis. Urine and feces were collected in&#xD;
      three dose groups of 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg respectively to explore the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics of urine and feces.&#xD;
