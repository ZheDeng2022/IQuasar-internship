    <textblock>
      This is an Open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase II pilot study to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of BMS-936558 with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy after induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy in cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current standard regimen for advanced biliary tract cancers as per NCCN guidelines&#xD;
      (version 2.2019) is gemcitabine plus cisplatin. However, since no single chemotherapy agent&#xD;
      or combination regimen has consistently led to durable tumor regression, prevention of&#xD;
      recurrent obstruction following palliative intervention, and extension of survival beyond 8&#xD;
      to 15 months, there is a pressing need for new treatment approaches in patients with dismal&#xD;
      prognosis. Recent discoveries in tumor immunology, paralleled by technological advances in&#xD;
      radiation therapy, have provided promising role for combining ablative radiotherapy with&#xD;
      targeted immune modulators (El Chediak et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      objectives: Primary: To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) at 8 months and the&#xD;
      disease control rate (DCR) in patients with non-resectable locally-advanced or metastatic or&#xD;
      recurrent intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) following BMS-936558&#xD;
      /stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To evaluate the overall survival (OS) rate in patients with advanced intrahepatic or&#xD;
      extrahepatic CCA following BMS-936558/SBRT treatment. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) To evaluate tumor response rates at the primary and secondary sites using the response&#xD;
      evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST1.1) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) To evaluate the duration of response at non-irradiated tumor sites in patients with Stage&#xD;
      IV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) To evaluate the following biomarkers: CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell infiltration, and&#xD;
      changes in PD-L1 expression at baseline and following first cycle of BMS-936558 and SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) To assess the safety and tolerability of BMS-936558/SBRT according to the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAEv5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7) To assess the quality of life of the patients through completed FACT-Hep questionnaires.&#xD;
