  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Telehealth After Stroke Care (TASC) trial is a pilot randomized controlled trial. It aims&#xD;
      to evaluate the feasibility of a telehealth based model providing multidisciplinary access&#xD;
      including nursing, pharmacy and physician care, and obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy&#xD;
      of an integrated telehealth approach to blood pressure management after stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the most modifiable risk factor for recurrent stroke. Blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      reduction is associated with decreased risk of stroke recurrence but remains poorly&#xD;
      controlled in most survivors. Minority groups have a higher prevalence of uncontrolled BP and&#xD;
      higher rates of stroke. Limited access contributes to challenges in post-stroke care.&#xD;
      Telehealth After Stroke Care (TASC) will be a telehealth intervention that integrates remote&#xD;
      BP monitoring and telehealth visits to enhance BP control and promote self-efficacy, with a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach to improve clinical processes and health outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess for feasibility and obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy. Fifty&#xD;
      (50) eligible patients will be screened for inclusion prior to hospital discharge and&#xD;
      randomized to TASC or usual care. TASC patients will receive a BP monitoring kit and&#xD;
      electronic tablet. They will be scheduled with 5 telehealth visits over 3 months, including&#xD;
      primary care nurse practitioner, pharmacy at 4 and 8 weeks and stroke neurologist. Usual care&#xD;
      patients will be seen by a primary care nurse practitioner at 1-2 weeks and a stroke&#xD;
      neurologist at 1 and 3 months. Data will be collected at 0 and 3 months. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be BP control (BP &lt;140/90 mmHg) at 3 months. The secondary outcome will be self-efficacy&#xD;
      in medication adherence and treatment. Interdisciplinary team competency, fidelity, and&#xD;
      telehealth satisfaction surveys will be administered. Patient reported outcomes including&#xD;
      depression, cognitive function, and socioeconomic determinants will also be collected.&#xD;
      Integrated team-based interventions are needed to improve BP control and reduce racial&#xD;
      disparities in post-stroke care. It may be feasible and effective in enhancing post-stroke BP&#xD;
      control and promoting self-efficacy.&#xD;
