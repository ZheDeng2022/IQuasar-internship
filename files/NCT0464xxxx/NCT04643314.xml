  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While video-assisted structured feedback by expert surgeons significantly improves&#xD;
      laparoscopic skill acquisition in surgical trainees, this method is resource intensive and&#xD;
      may have limited feasibility outside of research settings. Self-assessment and reflection are&#xD;
      integral parts of medical experiential learning; however the value of video-based&#xD;
      self-reflection in enhancing surgical skill acquisition remains to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of coached&#xD;
      video-based self-reflection approach on surgical trainee performance of laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a parallel, two-groups, assessor-blind, single-center, pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with participants (surgical trainees) individually allocated on a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to intervention group (guided video-based self-evaluation in addition to traditional&#xD;
      intraoperative teaching by faculty surgeons) and a control group (traditional intraoperative&#xD;
      teaching alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the trainees participating in this trial will be asked to submit intra-operative&#xD;
      video-recordings of 5 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed by them as the&#xD;
      primary operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial the intervention group participants will be asked to perform a guided&#xD;
      self-assessment of their intra-operative skills by watching their operative video-recording.&#xD;
      The trainee's self-assessment will be guided by validated intra-operative performance&#xD;
      assessment tools. The control group will not have access to their recorded video submissions&#xD;
      during the duration of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes assessed will include trainee's intra-operative performance and time to completion&#xD;
      of surgical procedure, Information generated from the pilot study will help inform a&#xD;
      full-scale RCT by testing the study procedures. Feasibility outcomes will include number of&#xD;
      trainees and surgeons approached, consented and randomized and adherence with&#xD;
      intervention(surgeons: intra-operative assessments; trainees: video-based assessments). Data&#xD;
      from this pilot study will inform the calculation of sample size requirements for the&#xD;
      full-scale RCT.&#xD;

    <description>In addition to their usual residency training, participants randomized to this group will undergo the following interventions:&#xD;
The participants will be asked to review their own operating room recordings (of each of the 5 consecutive submitted laparoscopic cholecystectomy cases that the participant acted as the primary operator) and to assess themselves (within 72 hours (3 days) of the procedure) using validated intra-operative assessment tools. The completion of the self-evaluations is to guide and document video-based self-reflection. The duration of self-assessment/reflection session will be up do the participant. Residents in this group will have unlimited access to their recordings through the web-based platform. On the other hand, they will not be able to access the battery of assessment forms after the third day following the procedure.</description>
