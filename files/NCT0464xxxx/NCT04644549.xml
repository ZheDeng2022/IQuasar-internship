    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, international, study to assess the natural history data from people&#xD;
      with Batten disease by collecting both retrospective and prospective information about the&#xD;
      motor, behavioral and functional capabilities of patients. The study initially has 2 cohorts.&#xD;
      Cohort 1 (n ≈ 75) includes subjects with CLN6 Batten disease. Cohort 2 (n ≈ 120) includes&#xD;
      subjects with juvenile CLN3 Batten disease. Additional cohorts for other Batten disease&#xD;
      subtypes may be added in the future.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has or had experienced another illness that is known to cause cognitive&#xD;
             decline (eg, trauma, meningitis, hemorrhage)&#xD;
