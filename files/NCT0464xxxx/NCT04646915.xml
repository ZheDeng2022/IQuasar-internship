    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic colectomy and anterior resection for&#xD;
      patients with colon/upper rectal cancer (CuRC) in day surgery center. Patients with colon or&#xD;
      upper rectal cancer who meet the standards of day surgery will be enrolled, and laparoscopic&#xD;
      radical resection of tumor will be performed in day surgery center. Perioperative outcomes of&#xD;
      these patients and reasons for transferring to inpatient ward will be recorded prospectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, with the development of laparoscopic surgery and the application of rapid&#xD;
      rehabilitation, colorectal surgery has made great progress . At the same time, the&#xD;
      application of evidence-based surgery and multimodal anesthesia in postoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitation has accelerated the postoperative recovery. Moreover, several previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that the implementation of ambulatory colorectal surgery can reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of postoperative complications and shorten hospital stay. With the continuous development of&#xD;
      rehabilitation surgery, the hospitalization time of colorectal surgery has been gradually&#xD;
      shortened. In addition, studies had preliminarily proved the feasibility, safety and&#xD;
      repeatability of outpatient colectomy and showed that 30% of patients with elective colectomy&#xD;
      can be completed in outpatient department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators designed the clinical pathway of day surgery for patients&#xD;
      screened by outpatient department, so that these patients can complete laparoscopic radical&#xD;
      resection of colon cancer or high rectal cancer in the day surgery center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of day surgery center for&#xD;
      patients with colon/upper rectal cancer (CuRC). Patients meet the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be assigned to day surgery center to perform radically laparoscopic&#xD;
      colectomy or anterior resection. Outcomes of interests including incidence of transfer to&#xD;
      inpatient ward, readmission, perioperative adverse events will be recorded prospectively.&#xD;
