  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the possible immune effects of two different diets targeting&#xD;
      the gut microbiome in patients with stage III-IV melanoma that has been removed by surgery&#xD;
      (resectable), has spread to other places in the body (metastatic), or is unable to be removed&#xD;
      by surgery (unresectable), and who are being treated with the immunotherapy drugs&#xD;
      pembrolizumab or nivolumab as part of their standard of care. Both diets are whole foods&#xD;
      diets that meet the American Cancer Society recommendations for cancer patients, but they&#xD;
      will vary in fiber content. The purpose of this trial is to learn about the effects of&#xD;
      dietary interventions on the structure and function of the gut microbiome in patients with&#xD;
      melanoma being treated with standard of care immunotherapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab).&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the effects of dietary intervention on the structure and function of the gut&#xD;
      microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the effects of dietary intervention on gut metabolic output and systemic&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the effects of dietary intervention on systemic and tumor immunity. III. Determine&#xD;
      the safety (adverse events [AEs]) and tolerability (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale for&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome [GSRS-IBS]) of the dietary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the rate of immune related adverse events in patients on immunotherapy receiving&#xD;
      dietary interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the maximum daily fiber content that 70% of participants are able to tolerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Assess the adherence to the dietary interventions as defined by 70% of calories consumed&#xD;
      over the duration of the study being derived from provided diets (as measured by food&#xD;
      records).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Assess the effects of dietary interventions on quality of life and other patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes (PROs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the association of dietary interventions with clinical outcomes (objective response&#xD;
      rate [ORR] and progression-free survival [PFS] rate in unresectable cohort and recurrence&#xD;
      rate [RR] in adjuvant cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore predictors of biological response to dietary interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (ISOCALORIC HIGH-FIBER DIET): Patients receive a whole foods diet that follows the&#xD;
      recommended American Cancer Society guidelines but is higher in fiber for 11 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (ISOCALORIC CONTROL DIET): Patients receive a standard whole foods diet of recommended&#xD;
      by the American Cancer Society for 11 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 12 weeks.&#xD;
