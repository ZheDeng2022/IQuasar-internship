  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 2 billion people worldwide are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB),&#xD;
      with 90% of individuals having latent infection (LTBI). The control of TB requires clearly&#xD;
      delineated helper T cell (Th) 1 responses and, to a lesser extent, Th17 responses, which both&#xD;
      play important roles in the induction and maintenance of protective immune responses in mouse&#xD;
      models of TB infection and in the prevention of active disease, as seen in LTBI. During&#xD;
      latency, M. tuberculosis is contained in localized granulomas. Mycobacteria specific T cells&#xD;
      mediate delayed type hypersensitivity reactions to purified protein derivative (PPD), and&#xD;
      this reaction is generally considered to indicate an LTBI status in the absence of&#xD;
      demonstrable active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the various risk factors that are known to play a role in promoting active TB, HIV is&#xD;
      the most well studied and described. However, in low-HIV-endemic countries like India, other&#xD;
      risk factors might play a more prominent role in active TB pathogenesis. These include&#xD;
      malnutrition, diabetes mellitus (DM), and helminth infections. LTBI individuals with these&#xD;
      comorbidities or coinfections could be at a higher risk for developing active TB than their&#xD;
      &quot;healthy&quot; LTBI counterparts without these comorbidities. Thus, it is imperative to study the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of TB infection and disease in these &quot;at risk&quot; populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will estimate the prevalence of severe to moderate malnutrition,&#xD;
      uncontrolled DM, and helminth infections in LTBI-positive individuals. We will collect&#xD;
      samples from a cohort of individuals with LTBI, those with LTBI and coexistent malnutrition,&#xD;
      DM, or helminth coinfection, and those without any of these conditions. Individual&#xD;
      participation may last up to 6 months. The main objective of the study is to estimate the&#xD;
      prevalence of malnutrition, DM, and helminth infections in LTBI individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously, we will perform transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic assays, including&#xD;
      profiles in serum and urine, to determine the biosignature portfolio of these individuals. In&#xD;
      addition, immunological assays examining cytokine/chemokine signatures as well as other&#xD;
      immune parameters related to innate and adaptive responses will be performed to enhance the&#xD;
      understanding of the immunological cross talk between LTBI and malnutrition, DM, and helminth&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;

      Study Design: This is a cross-sectional study to identify individuals with LTBI and&#xD;
      coinfections/comorbidities: malnutrition; DM; and helminth infections. Individuals will first&#xD;
      be evaluated clinically for symptoms of active TB. Individuals with symptoms of active TB&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study and referred for treatment. Individuals who are asymptomatic&#xD;
      for active TB will be screened for LTBI by interferon gamma (IFNÎ³) release assay (IGRA) and&#xD;
      clinically assessed for malnutrition (by body mass index [BMI]), evaluated for DM status (by&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] levels), and evaluated for helminth infection (by serology and stool&#xD;
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who are eligible will be assigned to one of six study groups based on LTBI status&#xD;
      and presence of coinfections/comorbidities. Participants will have an additional study visit&#xD;
      within 6 months of screening for clinical assessment and provide blood (30 ml), urine, and&#xD;
      stool samples for experimental studies and storage for future research. Key research&#xD;
      evaluations will include gene expression analyses and immunophenotyping on blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: N=5000&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: N=300; n=50 for each of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) and malnourished;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LTBI with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. LTBI with helminth infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. LTBI with multiple comorbidities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. LTBI with no comorbidities (LTBI+ healthy controls); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. LTBI negative healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Adults and adolescents (14-65 years of age) with or without LTBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To estimate the prevalence of malnutrition, DM and helminth infections in&#xD;
      LTBI individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To determine the effect of coinfections/comorbidities on biosignatures&#xD;
      of LTBI using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), proteomics, metabolomics, and immunological assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Prevalence of malnutrition, DM and helminth infections in LTBI individuals and&#xD;
      their effects on biosignatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will continue until both the total screening sample and the 6 study groups are&#xD;
      fully enrolled. We will increase the screening sample size to 6000 if the required study&#xD;
      group sample sizes are not achieved by screening 5000 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Plan: The screening phase of this study will be a community-based study in South&#xD;
      India. Participants will be recruited from villages in the Kancheepuram District, where&#xD;
      approximately 50% of the adult population tests positive for LTBI by IGRA based on our&#xD;
      previous study (unpublished data). We also anticipate based on our previous study that the&#xD;
      percentage of the adult population positive for malnutrition is 35%, for DM is 20%, and for&#xD;
      helminth infection is 20% (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The census in villages in the Kancheepuram District is updated annually by local health&#xD;
      workers employed by the Department of Public Health and the field teams of the NIRT in&#xD;
      Chennai, India. The villages will be chosen in consultation with the Department of Public&#xD;
      Health in Tamil Nadu. NIRT field teams will distribute pamphlets about the study to spread&#xD;
      awareness. The pamphlet will be approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) prior to&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination and history: Review of medical history and regular physical examination&#xD;
      (including height, weight, vital signs) will be performed at the screening phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study phase, a complete medical history will be taken, as well as a regular&#xD;
      physical exam with vital signs and anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, BMI&#xD;
      Z scores, weight for height Z scores, mid upper arm circumference, waist and abdominal&#xD;
      circumference, ratio of waist/hip circumference, skinfold thickness, and grip strength, and&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis. For the bioelectrical impedance analysis, a multifrequency&#xD;
      body composition analyser (Bodystat Quadscan 4000) will be used to derive body composition&#xD;
      data. The measurements will be taken with light clothing and according to standard&#xD;
      recommendations for conduct of bioelectrical impedance measurement (e.g., consistent time of&#xD;
      the day, voiding urine before measurement, avoiding measurements soon after a major meal or&#xD;
      exercise). The body composition data derived from the source data will be body fat mass, fat&#xD;
      free mass, and body cell mass. The visceral adiposity index will be calculated based on sex,&#xD;
      BMI, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Additionally,&#xD;
      questionnaires for smoking and drug and alcohol use, including estimating Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) scores, will also be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood draw: A total of 10 ml of blood will be initially collected from each participant via&#xD;
      venipuncture in the screening phase. The study phase will involve an additional 30 ml blood&#xD;
      draw. Blood will be used for laboratory evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine collection: Urine samples will be collected and stored and evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool collection: Stool samples will be collected in specialized containers and will be used&#xD;
      for DNA extraction and storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At-home stool/urine collection: Participants who cannot provide urine and/or stool at a study&#xD;
      visit may provide it within 3 days. The study team will provide instructions for the&#xD;
      collection and storage of the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collected at the screening phase will be used for the following evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Hematology: Complete blood count with differential and hematocrit levels. 2. IGRA&#xD;
      (QuantiFERON-TB Plus Gold In-Tube; Qiagen) to confirm LTBI status. 3. Biochemistry: HbA1c,&#xD;
      random blood glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), urea,&#xD;
      and creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. ELISA to identify and quantify infection with Wuchereria bancrofti. 5. Storage for future&#xD;
      research. Blood collected in the study phase will be used for the following evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fasting glucose, HbA1c, and other biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Macro- and micronutrient levels, including serum albumin, C-reactive protein,&#xD;
           cholesterol (total, HDL, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides), vitamins A, B6, B12,&#xD;
           C, D, and E, selenium, and zinc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For LTBI-negative individuals, repeat IGRA to confirm LTBI status. If the test is&#xD;
           positive, the remaining blood will be discarded and the individual will be withdrawn&#xD;
           from the LTBI negative cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Tempus or PAXgene tube blood collection for DNA and RNA isolation for experimental&#xD;
           studies and storage for future research. No human genetic testing will be performed&#xD;
           under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation for experimental studies and storage&#xD;
           for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Serum will also be collected for experimental studies and storage for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will be used for the following evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At screening, stool DNA for qPCR diagnostics to detect hookworms, Ascaris,&#xD;
           Strongyloides, and Trichuris.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Storage for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, urine samples collected in the study phase will be used for the following&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proteomic and metabolomic investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Storage for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of clinical evaluations will be returned to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcriptomics: We will perform RNA seq analysis on 50 individuals in each group to examine&#xD;
      the transcriptomic signature. RNA will be extracted from Tempus or PAXgene tubes, coded, and&#xD;
      analyzed by RNA seq. The data obtained will then be evaluated for RNA expression patterns and&#xD;
      alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteomics: Blood and urine proteomics is quickly becoming a major tool in advancing&#xD;
      biomarker discovery, validation, diagnostics, and other fields. We will use serum and urine&#xD;
      proteomics from a subset of individuals (n=30) in each group to perform proteomics by liquid&#xD;
      chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Bioinformatic analysis of protein expression in&#xD;
      these groups would provide useful information on the protein signatures of LTBI in high risk&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomics: We will use non-targeted capillary electrophoresis time of flight mass&#xD;
      spectrometry to analyze the serum metabolic profiles of a subset of individuals (n=30) in&#xD;
      each group. Metabolomics will complement the data obtained from proteomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Define circulating immune cell population frequencies by flow cytometry Our standardized&#xD;
           flow cytometry panels, described below, will be applied to a subset of individuals&#xD;
           (n=30) in each group (Table 1). We will measure frequencies of all major immune cell&#xD;
           subsets: monocytes, NK cells, B cells, and T cells, including CD56+ T cells. T cells&#xD;
           will further be divided into conventional T cells (CD4- and CD8 expressing cells) and&#xD;
           non conventional T cells (mucosal associated invariant T cells, NK T cells, and gamma&#xD;
           delta T cells). For conventional T cells, we will also capture memory phenotype and, for&#xD;
           CD4+ T cells, the Th subsets. We will perform quality control using repeat runs of&#xD;
           samples from a control donation to validate sample integrity and control for the&#xD;
           sometimes drastic technical variability observed in cytometry experiments. To minimize&#xD;
           technical variability, we will apply a centralized gating method where all results will&#xD;
           be analysed by the same individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Define the immune signatures of PBMCs and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells Cells will be&#xD;
           sorted on a fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) Aria cytometer from a subset of&#xD;
           individuals (n=20) in each group. A minimum of 50,000 cells each of PBMCs and memory&#xD;
           CD4+ and CD8+ T cells will be sorted into TRIzol LS. Based on our experience, at least&#xD;
           7% of PBMCs are memory CD4+ T cells and 4% are memory CD8+ T cells. Gene expression&#xD;
           profiles of whole PBMCs and sorted memory T cells will be obtained by RNA-seq using the&#xD;
           genome wide expression platform from Illumina, providing the expression levels for&#xD;
           &gt;50,000 identified genes in the human genome (including non-protein coding RNA species).&#xD;
           Sample generation, library preparation, sequencing, and mapping will be performed under&#xD;
           well-defined and standardized protocols, with quality control checks included at each&#xD;
           major step to ensure high quality data generation. For gene expression analysis, where a&#xD;
           huge number of variables is tested simultaneously, we will use the DESeq Benjamini&#xD;
           Hochberg corrected p-adjusted values of &lt;0.05 to identify differentially expressed genes&#xD;
           between groups. We will perform pathway analysis of genes significantly upregulated&#xD;
           between the different comparisons and investigate the associated gene modules. For this&#xD;
           purpose, we will use the web tool Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to determine which&#xD;
           pathways are significantly represented. We plan to use the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis&#xD;
           (IPA) software to determine in more detail the directionality of the overrepresented&#xD;
           functions and the common upstream regulators for the given set of genes. A complementary&#xD;
           approach will follow a modular analysis that identifies clusters of genes that share a&#xD;
           similar expression profile. In particular, we plan to use the weighted gene&#xD;
           co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm. By simultaneously monitoring the PBMC&#xD;
           immune cell composition, determining the overall PBMC gene expression, and determining&#xD;
           the profile of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we can detect disease specific signatures&#xD;
           in PBMCs in general and identify the contribution of T cell subsets to these&#xD;
           dysregulations in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Define antigen-reactive cellular immune responses by flow cytometry Antigen reactive&#xD;
           cellular immune responses will be measured in a subset of individuals (n=20) in each&#xD;
           group. PBMCs will be stimulated with PPD and M. tuberculosis whole cell lysate for 24&#xD;
           hours and antigen stimulated cellular immune responses will be studied. We plan to&#xD;
           examine a panel of activation markers (HLA-DR, CD38, OX-40 and CD153), cytokines (IL-2,&#xD;
           IFNÎ³, TNFÎ±, IL-17), and cytotoxic markers (perforin, granzyme B, granulysin, CD107a) on&#xD;
           all major conventional and non-conventional T cell subsets and NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Return of Research Results The experimental studies are not expected to reveal individual&#xD;
      clinical results or medically actionable incidental findings. Therefore, no research results&#xD;
      will be returned to participants.&#xD;
