    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial investigating the metformin is the treatment for hidradenitis&#xD;
      suppurativa. Metformin combined with doxycycline will be compared to the standard treatment&#xD;
      of doxycycline monotherapy for HS severity and the effect on the pre-diabetic condition.&#xD;

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>• For cost-effectiveness the direct medical costs will be will be assessed using the iMTA Medical Consumption Questionnaire (iMCQ), The measurement will be at baseline, at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks. Productivity losses will be collected using the iMTA Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ) includes three modules measuring productivity losses of paid work due to 1) absenteeism and 2) presenteeism and productivity losses related to 3) unpaid work. The friction cost method for valuing the production losses will be applied in accordance to the Dutch manual for costing studies. Hence, the productivity loss will be valued per worker by age and gender and, for long term absences, taking into account that productivity costs to society is confined to the period needed to replace a worker (the friction period). Cost effectiveness will be estimated using Dutch manual for costing studies in economic evaluations (publication of the Health Care Institute (ZIN).</description>
