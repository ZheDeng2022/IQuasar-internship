      A Combined Phase I Double-blind Randomized Placebo-controlled Study in Healthy Subjects/Phase&#xD;
      II, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multi-center Study in Hospitalized Patients&#xD;
      Infected with Severe and Critical SARS-CoV-2 to Assess the Safety, Pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamics and Efficacy of MRG-001 (Plerixafor Plus Low-dose Tacrolimus)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: To determine the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) profiles of MRG-001 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Time to clinical improvement from randomization by at least 2 points on the 8-point&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MRG-001 is a fixed-dose combination (FDC) drug, administered as a single subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      injection. Preclinical studies have demonstrated a synergistic effect of these 2 APIs in&#xD;
      mobilizing and recruiting stem cells/immunoregulatory cells and promoting tissue regeneration&#xD;
      in a wide variety of studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRG-001 is likely to target multiple aspects of the COVID-19. MRG-001 exhibits&#xD;
      immunoregulatory and regenerative properties in preclinical studies with a wide variety of&#xD;
      diseases. Repairing damaged tissues in the lung and other organs, restoring the anti-virus&#xD;
      immune system and modulating the inflammation are obvious therapeutic targets for COVID-19.&#xD;
      The combined phase I/IIa trial will involve 98 subjects (18 healthy volunteers and 80&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients) randomized into blinded placebo and MRG-001 arms, to determine the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy profile of MRG-001 as the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: The study has been completed on 05/07/2021. Data analysis will be initiated upon&#xD;
      database lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: The study is expected to start recruitment on 06/15/2021.&#xD;
