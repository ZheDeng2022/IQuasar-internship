  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DL-VSU-201 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study in subjects with a&#xD;
      non-infected venous stasis ulcer (VSU) that has failed to demonstrate improvement after&#xD;
      receiving at least 4 weeks of standard, conventional wound therapy to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Dermacyte® Amniotic Wound Care Liquid (Dermacyte® Liquid).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DL-VSU-201 is a multi-center, two-part study in patients with VSU (n=40). The run-in phase of&#xD;
      the study (Part 1) will enroll 10 eligible subjects. In part 1, patients will be randomized&#xD;
      1:1 to receive active Dermacyte once weekly or once every two weeks with standard of care.&#xD;
      The data from Part 1 will be reviewed to determine the administration frequency of the study&#xD;
      product (once weekly or once every two weeks) in Part 2 of the Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, approximately 30 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive Dermacyte Liquid or&#xD;
      placebo (0.9% NaCl) with standard of care. Subjects will be followed for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive localized subcutaneous injection of Dermacyte® Liquid or placebo into&#xD;
      and/or around the wound bed during during clinic visits over a 12-week period and assessed&#xD;
      for safety and efficacy measures at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Percent&#xD;
      reduction of the wound surface area will be formally collected at Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and&#xD;
      12. To assess healing, the ulcer will be evaluated by assessing the change in the surface&#xD;
      area (L X W) from Baseline. Overall change in VAS from Baseline to Week 12 will be evaluated&#xD;
      and total wound closure will be evaluated at Week 12.&#xD;
