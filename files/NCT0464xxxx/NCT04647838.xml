  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand efficacy of tepotinib in patients with solid cancers&#xD;
      harbouring c-MET amplification or exon 14 mutation who progressed after standard treatment&#xD;
      for metastatic disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a basket trial with two strata(NSCLC and other cancer). If MET exon 14 skipping&#xD;
      mutation or MET amplification(copy number gain ≥6.0 ) is detected by NGS method, then&#xD;
      confirmation of genetic findings by Molecular Steering Committee will be followed. Patient&#xD;
      can participate in this trial after confirmation of genetic analysis and reviewing other&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
