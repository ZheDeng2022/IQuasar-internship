  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I study of an 'in-house' developed, novel, Class I, prototype medical device to&#xD;
      facilitate vocalisation in participants with cuff-inflated tracheostomy tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To design and develop a device to deliver Above Cuff Vocalisation (ACV)&#xD;
      that is safe, well tolerated and effective at producing a voice in tracheostomised patients&#xD;
      in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To evaluate whether more effective delivery of ACV has a significant&#xD;
      impact on laryngeal function and recovery following new tracheostomy in ICU patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A tracheostomy is an artificial airway inserted into the trachea (windpipe) through the front&#xD;
      of the neck, usually required for prolonged artificial ventilation in the critically ill.&#xD;
      Between 10-15% of the 250,000 patients admitted annually to UK Intensive Care Units (ICUs)&#xD;
      require temporary tracheostomy, with an additional 5,000 tracheostomies performed during&#xD;
      surgery. The tubes have a cuff/balloon which seals the trachea when inflated, allowing lung&#xD;
      ventilation. The flow of gas into and out of the patient's lungs does not flow through the&#xD;
      upper airways (nose and mouth), bypassing the larynx (voice box) and preventing speech. Our&#xD;
      research found the biggest problem with tracheostomies from the patient's perspective is&#xD;
      losing the ability to speak. If the muscles of the larynx and throat are not used, they&#xD;
      quickly become weak, meaning that coughing, swallowing and talking can take longer to&#xD;
      recover. These problems cause anger, frustration, fear and low mood and lead to significantly&#xD;
      longer hospital stays, impacting ICU and hospital bed availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a weak cough or swallow cannot clear secretions from the throat, which may&#xD;
      enter the lungs (aspiration). The inflated cuff reduces aspiration and most ICU-specific&#xD;
      tubes have an extra suction-port for secretion removal. However, additional gas can be&#xD;
      directed via the suction-port, through the vocal cords and out via the upper airways,&#xD;
      allowing vocalisation. The MHRA confirmed these tubes can be used for 'above cuff voicing'&#xD;
      (ACV) in line with their CE marking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposed research advances healthcare technologies by developing a new clinically&#xD;
      validated prototype medical device with the potential to significantly increase patient&#xD;
      benefit for a defined and expanding area of clinical need. Our collaborative project combines&#xD;
      our clinical experience and understanding of the needs of tracheostomy patients and their&#xD;
      families with the design and engineering excellence of our University and SME partners. Our&#xD;
      team is supported by individual and institutional research expertise and together with our&#xD;
      patient partners, we can deliver an advanced prototype device with a clear pathway towards&#xD;
      adoption and commercialisation, attractive to follow-on funders and investors.&#xD;
