  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conjugated linoleic acid or CLA, is one of the food supplements that could be found in meat,&#xD;
      fats, and dairy products of ruminants which has been fed grass not on grains. CLA has shown&#xD;
      anti-cancer, anti-obesity, and anti-inflammatory effects in several animal modules, but the&#xD;
      results of the human studies were not consistent. Also, a very limited number of studies&#xD;
      looked at the CLA effect on the respiratory system. The study will look at the effect of 12&#xD;
      weeks of supplementation of conjugated linoleic acid on obesity markers, lung functions,&#xD;
      lipid profile, and inflammation in overweight and obese women in a double-blind randomized&#xD;
      control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study looked at the inflammation using different approaches, where it looked at the&#xD;
      expression of adhesion molecules on the proinflammatory monocytes as well as it analysed the&#xD;
      expression of the stress proteins Heat-shock proteins (HSPA1A and HSPB1)on the PBMCs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized control trial with parallel design, where consented&#xD;
      overweight and obese women from Chester city in the UK will be randomly assigned into two&#xD;
      groups one group CLA will receive 4.5 g/day CLA mixture capsules while the other group will&#xD;
      receive a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend three clinics and by the end of each clinic, the participants will&#xD;
      be asked to provide 20 ml venous blood samples for the analysis of the biological marker.&#xD;
      Participants' anthropometric, body composition, lung functions, Leptin adiponectin, lipid&#xD;
      profile, Adhesion molecules CD14, CD16, CD11b, and CD62L, HSPA1A, and HSPB1 will be assessed&#xD;
      at three time points, at baseline after 6 and 12 weeks. The level of CLA in the plasma, as&#xD;
      well as lipid profile (HDL, LDL, TC, TG), will be measured at each time point&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to fill three food diaries before attending each clinic. Body&#xD;
      composition will be measured using bioelectric impedance, lung functions will be assessed&#xD;
      using spirometers, adiponectin and leptin will be assessed using ELISA, and finally, CD11b,&#xD;
      CD62L, HSPA1A, and HSPB1 will be analysed using flow cytometer. Plasma level of c9, t11-CLA&#xD;
      and t10, c12-CLA will be measured using flame ionized Gas chromatography, and the lipid&#xD;
      profile will be assessed using ALERE AFINION™ AS100 ANALYZER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation for the RCT Sample size calculation is done using G*Power software, a total&#xD;
      of 20 participant is required, 10 participants in each group, to get an effect size of 1.3&#xD;
      kg/m2 change in BMI from baseline and SD of 0.45, 0.05 margin of error, 95% power and 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval. Considering a 150% drop out the total number will be 50, 25 in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' randomisation will be performed by an independent third party who is not&#xD;
      involved in the current trial. Participants will be randomised into blocks using&#xD;
      (www.randomization.com) which generate the randomisation plan. All the capsules will be&#xD;
      packed in a light protective dark brown tamper-proof container. The randomised participants&#xD;
      will be either allocated to the CLA group or the placebo group. CLA and placebo capsules will&#xD;
      have the same shape and colour, and both the participants and researcher will be blind to the&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. IBM SPSS Statistic Data Editor Software (version25) will be used for&#xD;
      the statistical analysis of this trial while the graphs will be made using GraphPad Prism&#xD;
      version 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics of baseline continuous data will be expressed in form of mean±&#xD;
      standard error of the mean (SEM). Nominal data will be expressed in percentages. The&#xD;
      parametric assumption will be checked using Shapiro-Wilk tests at a significant level p&lt;&#xD;
      0.05. The differences between the baseline characteristics in CLA and the placebo group will&#xD;
      be done using an independent t-test in parametric data or Mann Whitney U for non-parametric&#xD;
      data, at a significant level P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing the effects of CLA compared to placebo and the interaction with times (baseline, 6&#xD;
      weeks, and 12 weeks) will be done using Mixed Model Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) at a significant level p&lt; 0.05. The later analysis will be useing Tukey post hoc test&#xD;
      with Bonferroni correction for all the measured parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paired t-test or Wilcoxon test will be done to detect the difference within- participants&#xD;
      at different time points in parametric and non-parametric data, respectively, at a&#xD;
      significant level P&lt;0.05. Independent t-test or Mann Whitney U will be used to detect the&#xD;
      difference between the CLA group and placebo across the different time points for normally&#xD;
      and non-normally distributed data, respectively at a significant level P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in the change at week 6 compared to baseline, (∆ 6 weeks), and at week 12&#xD;
      compared to baseline (∆ 12 weeks), in CLA groups compared to placebo will be checked using&#xD;
      t-test in case of normally distributed data or Mann Whitney-U for non-parametric data at&#xD;
      significant level P&lt;0.05. The difference between the categorical data will be done using the&#xD;
      Chi-square test at a significant level p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
