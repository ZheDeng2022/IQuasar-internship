    <textblock>
      The present study aims to describe the results of a modified gastric bypass surgery to ensure&#xD;
      endoscopic access to the excluded remaining stomach, as well as to monitor the clinical&#xD;
      conditions of comorbidities and the patient's quality of life, since associated complications&#xD;
      can be found to the excluded stomach, such as: bile reflux, gastritis and / or gastric and&#xD;
      duodenal ulcer, H. pylori infection, bleeding, gastric polyps and the possibility of gastric&#xD;
      cancer in patients undergoing RYGB (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), with one of the probable&#xD;
      factors being the occurrence reflux of the duodenal content into the excluded portion of the&#xD;
      stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sense, based on technical concepts of an established surgical procedure, the RYGB,&#xD;
      the present project is not a proposal for a new procedure, but an adaptation of an existing&#xD;
      technique. The proposal of the present study is about adaptations in RYGB surgery, which will&#xD;
      enable endoscopic access to the remaining stomach, through the creation of a gastric&#xD;
      communication.&#xD;

      This is a prospective clinical trial with intentional sample selection, which will last 18&#xD;
      months and will be developed at the General State Hospital of Goi창nia Alberto Rassi (HGG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims at gastric bypass surgery modified for the purpose of ensuring&#xD;
      endoscopic access to the excluded remaining stomach, as well as monitoring the clinical&#xD;
      conditions of comorbidities and the patient's quality of life; evaluating the loss of excess&#xD;
      body weight of 50% (EBW50%), as recommended by the World Health Organization and the&#xD;
      Brazilian Society of Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery, to comparing weight loss before and&#xD;
      after surgery; comparing the incidence and control of comorbidities associated with excess&#xD;
      body weight, if the patient has any, before and after the surgery analyzing the nutritional&#xD;
      characteristics of the patients before and after the surgery and its relationship with the&#xD;
      obesity of their comorbidities; evaluating and comparing patients' quality of life before and&#xD;
      after bariatric surgery;measuring and comparing lung function, respiratory muscle strength&#xD;
      and endurance, physical fitness and functional capacity. The estimated sample size was&#xD;
      calculated in the Epi Info Software (version 7.2.3.1) considering a 95% Confidence Interval,&#xD;
      average volume of bariatric surgeries performed in the last year at HGG (p = 288) and an&#xD;
      occurrence of bile reflux after RYGB 1.9%. When considering an estimated margin of error of&#xD;
      5%, the total value of twenty-six patients was found to compose the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicting the occurrence of possible losses from follow-up throughout the study, a margin of&#xD;
      30% was added to the calculated value, ending with a total of 33 patients to compose the&#xD;
      sample. Free-demand patients at the State Hospital of Goi창nia Alberto Rassi, who have an&#xD;
      indication for bariatric and / or metabolic surgery confirmed by the medical and&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team, will be selected as potential participants in the research. The&#xD;
      patient will be invited to participate in the study, receiving complete information about the&#xD;
      planned procedures, risks and possible benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's refusal to participate in the research will not result in discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment. The baseline clinical parameters of the selected patients (age, weight, BMI, blood&#xD;
      pressure, presented comorbidities, cardiovascular history, previous clinical treatments for&#xD;
      the control of DM2 (Type 2 diabetes Mellitus), eating habits and physical activity) will be&#xD;
      collected and inserted in clinical records during preoperative multidisciplinary&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on food consumption will be collected in the preoperative period and in the&#xD;
      postoperative period of 6, 12 and 18 months, through the application of the Food Frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to collecting this information, the patient will be referred for preoperative&#xD;
      exams, which will also be recorded in the patient's medical record. After fulfilling the&#xD;
      criteria and after signing the Informed Consent Form, thirty-three patients will be selected&#xD;
      who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria to perform the modified RYGB technique to&#xD;
      maintain gastro-gastric communication for endoscopic study after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a consultation with the multidisciplinary team, when they will receive&#xD;
      nutritional, psychological and physiotherapy team guidance. Once the date of the surgery is&#xD;
      scheduled, the participants must follow the following regimen: absolute fasting of 8 hours&#xD;
      before surgery, prophylactic dose of anticoagulant 12 hours before the surgery. Patients will&#xD;
      be admitted 24 to 48 hours before the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery will be performed at the General State Hospital of Goi창nia Alberto Rassi. After&#xD;
      the preoperative procedure, the patient will be submitted to general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Prophylactically, the patient will receive a single dose of 2 to 3 grams of kefazol 1 hour&#xD;
      before the procedure, and to allergies 600 to 900 mg of intravenous clindamycin, and&#xD;
      pneumatic socks and leggings will be provided to prevent thromboembolic events. For safety&#xD;
      reasons, the patient will be monitored throughout the surgical procedure using&#xD;
      multiparametric electronic monitors and bladder catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a median laparotomy will be performed with the measurement of the length of the&#xD;
      entire small intestine, followed by an approach to the small curvature of the stomach, where&#xD;
      it will be performed.&#xD;
