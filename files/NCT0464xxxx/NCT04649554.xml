      The objectives of this study are to capture the change in pain intensity, physical/emotional&#xD;
      function, and pain impact for patients diagnosed with neuropathic pain who undergo an&#xD;
      Exablate treatment and to capture safety data of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety assessment measure is the incidence and frequency of device and procedure related&#xD;
      Adverse Events (AEs) in subjects who undergo an Exablate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance will be measure by assessing the change from baseline to 3 months post Exablate&#xD;
      treatment for pain intensity defined as a decrease of at least 30% of pain on the Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS). Assessing the change from baseline to 6-12 months post Exablate treatment&#xD;
      for pain intensity assessed by using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;

    <description>Assessing the change from baseline to 3 months post Exablate treatment for pain intensity defined as a decrease of at least 30% of pain on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst pain. The questionnaire with higher score indicates a higher pain level.</description>

    <time_frame>3, 6, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to 3 months post Exablate treatment for Physical Function/Disability measured using the Pain Disability Index (PDI). On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no disability at all and 10 being the worst disability.

    <time_frame>3, 6, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to 3 months post Exablate treatment for Emotional Function/Catastrophizing measured using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). On a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being not at all 4 being all the time. PCS questionnaire is a validated scale that measures the magnitude of catastrophizing (negative thoughts and feelings while a patient is experiencing pain).</description>
