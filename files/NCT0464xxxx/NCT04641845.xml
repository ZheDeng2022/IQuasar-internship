  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic alignment is important for walking function and walking comfort in people with a&#xD;
      transtibial amputation (TTA). Prosthetic alignment is defined as the position of prosthetic&#xD;
      parts relative to the body and to each other. A suboptimal alignment decreases stability and&#xD;
      increases energy use during walking. Therefore, finding the optimal alignment is an important&#xD;
      aspect of rehabilitation. Shoe heel height is considered to influence prosthetic alignment,&#xD;
      walking comfort and gait symmetry in people with a TTA. Unfortunately, research on the effect&#xD;
      of heel height is scarce and no evidence is available on the effects of variations smaller&#xD;
      than 20 mm. However, these small heel height variations between store-bought shoes are often&#xD;
      overlooked by people with an amputation and may cause secondary musculoskeletal problems in&#xD;
      the long term. To increase the knowledge on this topic, this study aims to examine the&#xD;
      effects of small increases in heel height on gait symmetry in people with a TTA and healthy&#xD;
      individuals. It was expected that higher heel height would cause more asymmetry in gait and&#xD;
      lower walking comfort. People with a TTA were expected to be affected more by heel height&#xD;
      changes than healthy individuals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Optimal prosthetic alignment is essential to achieve a functional gait pattern in people with&#xD;
      a transtibial amputation (TTA). A suboptimal alignment decreases stability, increases the&#xD;
      metabolic costs of walking, and increases the risk of secondary musculoskeletal and stump&#xD;
      problems. Prosthetic alignment is defined as the position of the prosthetic parts relative to&#xD;
      the body and to each other. Dynamic alignment of the prosthesis, especially the 'fine tuning'&#xD;
      of the prosthesis based on the patient's needs, is a continuous process during&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the entire alignment process the prosthetists takes the shoe heel height of the&#xD;
      patient into account. Moreover, patients are advised to search for a similar heel height when&#xD;
      purchasing new shoes. However, prosthetic walkers frequently report complaints during their&#xD;
      follow-up visits with their prosthetist or rehabilitation physician that possibly are related&#xD;
      to prosthetic misalignment. Although several studies describe the effects of heel height on&#xD;
      gait in healthy individuals, our knowledge about the effects of heel height within the TTA&#xD;
      population is still limited to one study examining heel height changes of 20 millimeter. The&#xD;
      variation in heel height of commercially available shoes is often smaller, and therefore&#xD;
      easily overlooked by people with a TTA. Since it is not clear what the effects of smaller&#xD;
      heel height variations on the gait pattern are, additional research is needed to enable&#xD;
      prosthetists and therapists to better advise their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary objective was to examine the effect of small increases in heel height&#xD;
      on gait symmetry in people with a TTA. It was expected that a larger increase in heel height&#xD;
      would result in more gait asymmetry and lower walking comfort. In addition, healthy&#xD;
      individuals were included in whom smaller effects of the heel height changes were expected.&#xD;
