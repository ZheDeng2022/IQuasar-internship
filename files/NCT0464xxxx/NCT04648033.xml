  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, single arm, open-label trial that will utilise a Time To Event Continual&#xD;
      Reassessment Method (TiTE-CRM) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of atovaquone in&#xD;
      combination with concurrent CRT in NSCLC. Twenty evaluable participants will be recruited at&#xD;
      two centres.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twice daily oral atovaquone will be added to standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT): 66&#xD;
      Gy in 33 fractions, once daily, 5 days a week (Monday-Friday), with cisplatin (80 mg/m2 IV on&#xD;
      days 1 and 22 of CRT) and vinorelbine (15 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, 22 and 29 of CRT). Whilst&#xD;
      awaiting CRT to start, patients will receive two weeks (+/- 7 days) of oral atovaquone to&#xD;
      ensure steady state is reached (after seven days). Patients will be allocated one of four&#xD;
      dose levels: 450 mg, 600 mg, 675 mg or 750 mg (all doses PO BD). Atovaquone dose will be&#xD;
      assigned as per the TiTE-CRM statistical model. The first two trial participants will receive&#xD;
      450 mg BD. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, subsequent patients will be assigned&#xD;
      doses up to and including 750 mg BD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxia biomarker data will be collected at baseline (start of atovaquone run-in) and&#xD;
      following two weeks (+/- 7 days) of atovaquone treatment. Atovaquone will then be continued&#xD;
      without break for the duration of CRT, with the CRT schedule remaining constant for all&#xD;
      patients at both centres. Assessment for Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) will be from the&#xD;
      first scheduled dose of atovaquone until three months after completion of CRT. The CT scan&#xD;
      performed at the three-month follow up visit will be reviewed to collect tumour response&#xD;
      data.&#xD;

    <description>Atovaquone is taken during an initial run in period (2 weeks +/- 7 days), then continued during standard of care CRT. Atovaquone dose level is allocated to each patient by a TiTE-CRM statistical model which takes into account all toxicity data to date: 450 mg, 600 mg, 675 mg or 750 mg (all doses PO BD).&#xD;
Two 21-day cycles of cisplatin and vinorelbine chemotherapy will be given concurrently during radiotherapy treatment. Patients will receive 80 mg/m2 cisplatin on days 1 &amp; 22 of their CRT treatment and 15 mg/m2 vinorelbine on days 1, 8, 22 &amp; 29. Thoracic radiotherapy will be delivered in 66 Gy in 33 fractions, once daily, 5 days a week (Monday-Friday).&#xD;
The last dose of atovaquone will be on the morning of the last fraction of radiotherapy. Total duration of atovaquone treatment will be 59 days (+/- 7 days), unless stopped earlier for toxicity or any other reason.&#xD;
Patients will be followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months post-CRT.</description>
