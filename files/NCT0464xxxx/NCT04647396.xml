  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no specific therapy for acute kidney injury. It is presumed that supportive measures&#xD;
      improve the care and outcome of patients with acute kidney injury. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the implementation of a bundle of supportive measures adapted to patients&#xD;
      undergoing major non-cardiac surgery reduces the occurrence of AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized prospective multicenter trial is needed to investigator whether the&#xD;
      implementation of the bundle of measures is effective to prevent AKI in high risk patients&#xD;
      undergoing major non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In earlier studies, interventions to treat acute kidney injury (AKI) were started after a&#xD;
      functional damage of the kidneys was already established. However, none of the interventions&#xD;
      had an effect in treating AKI. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines recommend implementing different measures in patients at high risk for&#xD;
      AKI, but the evidence that the implementation of the bundle (consisting of optimization of&#xD;
      hemodynamics and perfusion pressure, avoidance of nephrotoxins and hyperglycemia) can prevent&#xD;
      AKI is very weak. Biomarkers can be used to identify patients at high risk for AKI after&#xD;
      surgery (prior to the development of AKI). The cell-cycle arrest biomarkers, Tissue Inhibitor&#xD;
      of Metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) and Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7),&#xD;
      have been demonstrated to have the best predictive performance for the development of AKI&#xD;
      after surgery as compared to other biomarkers. In addition, these biomarkers are not&#xD;
      influenced by different co-morbidities or other clinical situations. In the BigpAK1 trial,&#xD;
      which was a single-center trial, the authors investigated whether a biomarker-guided&#xD;
      implementation of the KDIGO guidelines can reduce the occurrence of AKI in patients&#xD;
      undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. The results demonstrate that the implementation of the&#xD;
      KDIGO bundle in high risk patients for AKI ([TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] between 0.3 and 2)&#xD;
      significantly reduced the occurrence of AKI compared to the standard of care group. However,&#xD;
      this was a single center trial which needs to be confirmed in a large trial. Therefore, based&#xD;
      on these data, a definitive, prospective, randomized controlled, multicenter study including&#xD;
      1302 surgical patients at high risk for AKI identified by [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this trial is to investigate the effect of the implementation of the KDIGO bundle&#xD;
      in patients at high risk for AKI after major non-cardiac surgery compared to standard of care&#xD;
      in the same patient population. This biomarker-guided approach (individualized therapy)&#xD;
      enables to treat patients at high risk for AKI prior to a functional damage of the kidneys.&#xD;
