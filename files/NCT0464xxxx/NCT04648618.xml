  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by intermittent nocturnal hypoxemia, frequent&#xD;
      arousals, fragmented sleep and daytime sleepiness. It has been shown to increase the risk of&#xD;
      cardiac and vascular disease through multiple mechanisms including sympathetic hyperactivity,&#xD;
      metabolic dysregulation, and activation of oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness in the working age group, affecting 93&#xD;
      million people worldwide. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a sight threatening complication&#xD;
      and the most common cause of visual loss in patients with diabetes. OSA is frequently&#xD;
      associated with diabetes with prevalence ranging from 23 to 86%. However, the relationship&#xD;
      between OSA and DME is not well defined. The retina is especially susceptible to hypoxia,&#xD;
      being one of the most metabolically active tissues. Many of the same inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      have also been found to be elevated in patients with diabetic macular edema, including VEGF,&#xD;
      VCAM-1 and IL-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been no previous study examining the biochemical impact of OSA on patients with&#xD;
      DME. We aim to explore this relationship by examining the differences in inflammatory markers&#xD;
      expressed in patients with DME who have undergone an overnight sleep study, which is&#xD;
      considered the gold standard diagnostic tool in OSA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of inflammatory mediators in diabetic&#xD;
      patients with macular edema with and without OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single centre, prospective, cross-sectional study. We will be recruiting&#xD;
      patients undergoing intravitreal injection for diabetic macular edema divided into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: diabetic patients with macular edema, no OSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: diabetic patients with macular edema, and OSA&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo baseline ophthalmologic examination as part of a regular clinic&#xD;
      visit including best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit lamp exam, dilated&#xD;
      retinal exam, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Diagnosis of&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema will be confirmed with standard domain OCT. Diagnosis of OSA will be&#xD;
      confirmed through gold standard of overnight polysomnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data including demographics, ocular history, best corrected visual acuity, IOP, blood sugar&#xD;
      control and sleep metrics will be collected. Serum and aqueous fluid samples will be&#xD;
      collected at time of first intravitreal injection including VEGF, Placental growth factor,&#xD;
      TGFB, ICAM-1,IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,IL-17, VCAM-1, MCP-1, Epidermal growth factor,&#xD;
      Pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF), Angiotensin 2 and Platelet derived growth factor&#xD;
      (PDGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of cytokine in serum and aqueous humour&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Best-corrected visual acuity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of cytokines in serum and aqueous humor in patients with and without OSA will be&#xD;
      compared using T test. Statistical significance is defined as p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
