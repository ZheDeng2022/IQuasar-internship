  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is comprised of two discrete Parts. Part A is a 3-period cross over evaluating&#xD;
      relative bioavailability. Part B is a 2-period cross over evaluating bioequivalence. There&#xD;
      will be a minimum of a 7-day washout period between treatment periods. Participants will&#xD;
      participate in Part A or Part B, but not both. Approximately 200 participants will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;

             in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population&#xD;
             being studied may be included only if the investigator and/or the Medical Monitor&#xD;
             agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors&#xD;
             and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with body weight more than or equal to (&gt;=) 45 kilogram (kg) and body&#xD;
             mass index (BMI) within the range 19-31 kg per meter square (Kg/m^2).&#xD;

             procedures or compromise participant safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in the study would result in loss of blood or blood products in excess&#xD;
             of 500 milliliter (mL) within 30 days prior to Day 1 in this study. Exposure to more&#xD;

             investigational study treatment) within the last 30 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever&#xD;

             investigational study intervention or any other type of medical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part A participants may not participate in Part B, and Part B participants may not&#xD;
             participate in Part A if enrolment is concurrent or overlaps.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with regular alcohol consumption within 6 months prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular&#xD;
             use of tobacco or nicotine containing products (nicotine patches or vaporizing&#xD;
             devices) within 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with sensitivity to any of the study interventions, or components&#xD;
             thereof, or drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical&#xD;
