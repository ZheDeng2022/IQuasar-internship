  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a cross-sectional, observational study to investigate&#xD;
      whether plasma GPLD1 concentrations are associated with higher cognitive function and better&#xD;
      brain structure and function in two groups of older adults with high or low levels of&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional, observational study which will enroll up to 24 healthy, older&#xD;
      adults (65-85 y, BMI 20-35 kg/m2), and stratify by current self-reported physical activity&#xD;
      level (12 inactive vs. 12 highly active).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Investigate whether physical activity level is associated with GPLD1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Investigate whether cognitive function and brain structure/function are associated&#xD;
      with GPLD1.&#xD;
