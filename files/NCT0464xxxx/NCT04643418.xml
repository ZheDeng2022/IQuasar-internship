  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, Phase 1/2a study with&#xD;
      dose escalation in patients with advanced solid tumors (Part 1) and cohorts of up to 15&#xD;
      patients per selected indication (Part 2). The solid tumor types in Part 2 will be decided by&#xD;
      the sponsor prior to the start of Part 2, but not be solely based on the efficacy results in&#xD;
      Part 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will occur in two parts, Dose-escalation (Part 1) and Cohort-expansion (Part 2).&#xD;
      The main purpose of Part 1 is to determine the doses and dosing schedule of MPB-1734 that is&#xD;
      safe and tolerable when given in subjects with certain types of advanced cancer. Part 2 of&#xD;
      the study will begin when the Sponsor determines the safe and tolerable doses and dosing&#xD;
      schedule from Part 1. The main purpose of Part 2 is to continue to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the MPB-1734 dose and dosing schedule determined by the Sponsor during Part&#xD;
      1. The preliminary efficacy of MPB-1734 will also be assessed in both Part 1 and Part 2.&#xD;
