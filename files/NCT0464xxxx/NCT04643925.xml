  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to examine the possible effects of hCG administration for eight&#xD;
      weeks prior to IVF/ICSI in women with low ovarian reserve. Primary outcome is the proportion&#xD;
      of the antral follicle count that reach the pre-ovulatory stage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the fundamental goals in In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is obtaining a high number of&#xD;
      good quality oocytes, in order to select and transfer embryos with the highest possible&#xD;
      implantation potential thereby optimizing the chance of a pregnancy and ultimately a live&#xD;
      birth. This is done by applying an individualized controlled ovarian stimulation (iCOS)&#xD;
      protocol, primarily based on ovarian reserve markers like antral follicle count (AFC) and&#xD;
      Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), when deciding the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
      stimulation dose. Certain patients, the so called &quot;poor ovarian responders' (PORs), pose a&#xD;
      clinical challenge because they have a poor ovarian reserve and develop a limited number of&#xD;
      pre-ovulatory follicles in respond to ovarian stimulation despite high FSH stimulation doses,&#xD;
      thus experiencing reduced live birth rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to examine the possible effects of long-term LH activity by&#xD;
      the administration of hCG for eight weeks in between two identical IVF/ICSI cycles and&#xD;
      compare cycle characteristics and outcome. The primary outcome is the follicular output rate&#xD;
      (FORT) which reflects the proportion of antral follicles at the start of controlled ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation that reaches the pre-ovulatory state. Secondary outcomes include amongst others&#xD;
      AMH and antral follicle count at baseline (cd 2-3), number of pre-ovulatory follicles,&#xD;
      oocytes retrieved, and embryos developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that eight weeks of androgen priming by hCG increases the proportion of antral&#xD;
      follicles that reaches the pre-ovulatory state during controlled ovarian stimulation for&#xD;
      IVF/ICSI in women with poor ovarian reserve.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Women will undergo two identical consecutive IVF/ICSI treatments: a Control cycle including blastocyst culture and freeze-all and a subsequent identical Study cycle, separated by eight weeks of androgen priming by daily hCG-injections. Both IVF/ICSI cycles are performed in the fixed GnRH-antagonist protocol using a daily dose of 300 IU rFSH initiated from cd 2-3 and the GnRH antagonist (Fyremadel 0.25 mg) from stimulation day 5-6.</intervention_model_description>
