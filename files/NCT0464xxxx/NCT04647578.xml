  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC)&#xD;
      and IBD-unclassified (IBD-U), are characterised by chronic inflammation of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. Over the past 50 years, the incidence of IBD has increased globally,&#xD;
      with the highest increase in industrialised countries. During the last 25 years, the&#xD;
      incidence of IBD has increased dramatically among teenagers in northern France, with an&#xD;
      increase of 126% and 156% for CD and UC, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical fitness is a set of attributes related to a person's ability to perform physical&#xD;
      activities that require aerobic capacity, endurance, strength or flexibility and is&#xD;
      determined by a combination of regular physical activity and genetically inherited ability.&#xD;
      Physical fitness, widely recognised as an important health determinant, plays an important&#xD;
      role in growth and development. Due to the evidence-based importance of physical fitness for&#xD;
      young people's health status, attention should be paid to the assessment of physical fitness&#xD;
      at these ages and whatever the health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time, there is no study on the assessment of physical fitness in IBD pediatric&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
