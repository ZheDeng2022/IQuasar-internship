  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In elderly patients, hip fracture should be surgically treated within 48 hours from&#xD;
      admission, since its deferral worsens the mortality. However, sometimes patients are affected&#xD;
      by cardiovascular or cerebral comorbidities, deeming necessary the use of antiplatelets&#xD;
      and/or anticoagulant therapies. Clopidogrel is a second-generation thienopyridine&#xD;
      antiplatelet drug which exerts its effect by the inhibition of the platelet's purinergic&#xD;
      receptor P2Y12 preventing adenosine diphosphate (ADP) from stimulating it. Guidelines&#xD;
      recommend to withhold clopidogrel for 5 days before the possibility to perform neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia, which is frequently the optimal perioperative management of a fragile patient. It&#xD;
      should be mentioned however that around 30% of patients are resistant to clopidogrel and they&#xD;
      show a normal platelet reactivity despite the antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, in principle,&#xD;
      these patients do not require to defer surgery. We have therefore hypothesized that some&#xD;
      patients taking clopidogrel might anticipate surgery before 5 days and within 48 hours,&#xD;
      following a protocol based on the assessment of coagulation and platelet aggregation through&#xD;
      thromboelastography (TEG) in combination with an ADP Platelet Mapping assay kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hospital admission for femur fracture, eligible patients would be evaluated by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist and the orthopedic physicians for anesthesia and surgery. Immediately a&#xD;
      sample of blood should be collected for TEG with ADP Platelet Mapping test. If both MA-ADP&#xD;
      and platelets aggregation (%) will be within normal values, the patient could be considered&#xD;
      as candidate for immediate surgery (within 48 hours) with neuraxial anesthesia and&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided antalgic femoral nerve block. If MA-ADP and/or platelets aggregation (%)&#xD;
      are lower, risk for mortality should be assessed. If the patient would be considered at high&#xD;
      risk for mortality, he/she would undergo to general anesthesia and peripheral antalgic block&#xD;
      to not postpone surgery. Otherwise, surgery would be postponed until the normalization of&#xD;
      both MA-ADP and platelet aggregation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is an established and recognized health problem associated with the age of the&#xD;
      population. In the elderly, it is essential that surgery for hip fractures would be performed&#xD;
      within 48 hours from admission. Whenever delayed beyond 48 hours, the probability of 30-day&#xD;
      mortality increases by 41% and the odds of one-year mortality by 32%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuraxial anesthesia and/or peripheral nerve block are generally preferred in elderlies.&#xD;
      However, cardiovascular and/or cerebral comorbidities require antiplatelets therapies at&#xD;
      home. This treatment precludes the possibility of an optimal anesthesiologic strategy (i.e.,&#xD;
      loco-regional anesthesia) within the recommended surgical timing. Therefore, an individual&#xD;
      approach is required to balance the risk of drugs continuation/cessation on major&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and on peri-operative bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clopidogrel is a second-generation thienopyridine antiplatelet drug, that exerts its effect&#xD;
      by the inhibition of the platelet's purinergic receptor P2Y12, preventing adenosine&#xD;
      diphosphate (ADP) from stimulating it. In patients needing surgery, guidelines recommend&#xD;
      withholding clopidogrel 5 days before. However, around 30% of patients are resistant to&#xD;
      clopidogrel for several reasons. Patients resistant to clopidogrel may be identify through&#xD;
      the thromboelastography (TEG). TEG is a resonance-frequency viscoelastic point-of-care&#xD;
      diagnostic system that assesses hemostasis and response to antiplatelet therapy, in&#xD;
      combination with the ADP Platelet Mapping assay kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been hypothesized that the assessment of platelet aggregation with TEG and ADP&#xD;
      Platelet Mapping may identify patients resistant to clopidogrel, not requiring to wait for 5&#xD;
      days for hip replacement surgery. We have therefore designed this protocol to guide&#xD;
      anesthesiologists in the management of elderlies receiving clopidogrel and requiring surgery&#xD;
      for hip fracture. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate if in a small population of&#xD;
      patients, our protocol based on platelet function monitoring would anticipate surgery within&#xD;
      48 hours at least in 70% of elderly patients receiving clopidogrel.&#xD;

    <description>After evaluation at the Emergency Department the anesthesiologist immediately collects a sample of blood for TEG with ADP Platelet Mapping test.&#xD;
If both MA-ADP and platelets aggregation (%) are within normal values (i.e. ≥45 mm and ≥83%, respectively), the patient could be considered as candidate for immediate surgery (within 48 hours) with neuraxial anesthesia.&#xD;
If MA-ADP and/or platelets aggregation (%) are lower than normal values, the Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS) is computed, to predict the 30-day mortality after hip fracture surgery. If NHFS is ≥4 (high risk), the patient will undergo to general anesthesia and peripheral antalgic block, to perform surgery within 48 hours. In case of low risk for mortality (i.e. a NHFS &lt;4), surgery will be postponed until the normalization of both MA-ADP and platelet aggregation.</description>
