    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing treatment with intrauterine insemination (IUI) will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive an endometrial scratch or sham procedure during the menstrual phase of the treatment&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is a common issue faced by many couples throughout the United States. There are&#xD;
      multiple fertility treatment options, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine&#xD;
      insemination (IUI). Additionally, methods such as endometrial scratch (a modified endometrial&#xD;
      biopsy) have been postulated to increase success rate. This prospective, randomized control&#xD;
      trial will assess whether performing an endometrial scratch improves cycle outcomes and&#xD;
      decreases time to pregnancy following IUI. Each patient will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either an endometrial scratch or undergo a &quot;sham&quot; procedure (speculum insertion but no&#xD;
      scratch) during the menstrual phase of the IUI cycle.&#xD;

    <description>A speculum will be inserted into the vagina and the cervix cleansed with betadine (or alternative if allergy). The cervix will be grasped with a single tooth tenaculum and an endometrial biopsy pipelle inserted into the uterine cavity to the depth of the uterine fundus. Suction will be applied and the pipelle will be completely withdrawn in a single pass. All instruments will be removed from the vagina after hemostasis is ensured.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients undergoing intrauterine insemination procedures between the ages of 18&#xD;
             and 37 who have undergone a complete fertility work up (tubal, uterine, hormonal and&#xD;
             sperm assessments) and do not have a current tubal or uterine factor infertility or&#xD;
             severe male factor (expected to have &lt; 10 million total motile sperm on IUI sample)&#xD;
             unless using donor sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  age &lt; 18 or &gt; 37, expectation (prior to randomization) of &lt; 10 million total motile&#xD;
             sperm on IUI sample, tubal factor, uterine factor, incomplete fertility work up.&#xD;
      </textblock>

    <gender>Female</gender>
    <gender_based>Yes</gender_based>
    <gender_description>Participants are all undergoing intrauterine insemination and thus must have a uterus. This definition is based on anatomy rather than gender identity.</gender_description>
