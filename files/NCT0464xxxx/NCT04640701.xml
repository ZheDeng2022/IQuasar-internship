  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a national epidemic that affects all aspects of health care, including trauma&#xD;
      care. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1% of US adults 20 years&#xD;
      old and older are obese (body mass index [BMI], calculated as weight in kilograms divided by&#xD;
      height in meters squared, &gt; 30), and 69% are overweight (BMI &gt; 25) (1, 2). Obesity is a major&#xD;
      health concern because of its established relationship with serious medical diseases and&#xD;
      increased likelihood of comorbid conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, heart&#xD;
      disease, pulmonary disease) (3). As the number of obese adults continues to increase, the&#xD;
      potential number of obese trauma patients with severe injury and complications will also&#xD;
      increase (3). Management of prehospital and in-hospital trauma care, including complications&#xD;
      associated with airway management, surgical procedures, and radiological imaging, of obese&#xD;
      patients can be challenging. However, published reports on how obesity complicates hospital&#xD;
      stays after trauma are conflicting (4, 5). Several studies have indicated that obese trauma&#xD;
      patients are more likely than non-obese patients to have longer stays in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) and hospital, more days of mechanical ventilation, more complications, and&#xD;
      comorbid conditions, and higher mortality (6,7,8). Other studies have indicated no&#xD;
      differences between obese and nonobese patients in mortality, length of stay in the ICU and&#xD;
      the hospital, duration of mechanical ventilation, complications, or comorbid conditions (9).&#xD;
      Accordingly, the main aim of this study is to investigate and compare hospital course,&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, disposition, and the cost of treatment between geriatric obese and&#xD;
      non-obese patients hospitalized for treatment of traumatic injuries.&#xD;

      This proposed research is a retrospective chart review to determine if trauma patients with&#xD;
      different body mass indexes differed in hospital course, clinical outcomes, disposition, and&#xD;
      the cost of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records of trauma patients who were admitted to MHS between January1st 2006 and June 30th&#xD;
      2016 will be retrieved to review the clinical charts according to the investigator's&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic demographics and clinical outcomes parameters as noted above will be attained from the&#xD;
      patient's medical records.&#xD;
