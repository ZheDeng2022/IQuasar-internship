  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if office-based injection of a local&#xD;
      anesthetic/steroid combination at the area of one superior laryngeal nerve can decrease cough&#xD;
      frequency and alleviate symptoms of chronic cough in patients with neurogenic cough.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurogenic cough is a chronic cough without a clear cause. It is thought to be related to&#xD;
      irritation of a nerve that goes to the larynx (voice box). This can happen after a viral&#xD;
      upper respiratory infection. Current treatment uses therapy or medications taken by mouth.&#xD;
      Those medications can be sedating and not well tolerated. An alternative approach would be to&#xD;
      perform an injection &quot;nerve block&quot;, which is commonly done for other nerve disorders such as&#xD;
      around the spine. This may help people with neurogenic cough also. We studied this recently&#xD;
      in a small group of patients and found that patients had improvement in their cough symptoms&#xD;
      (Simpson 2018). It would be helpful to study this in a larger group of patients using more&#xD;
      methods of evaluating cough symptom severity.&#xD;

    <description>The Leicester Cough Questionnaire consists of 19 questions designed to assess the impact of cough on various aspects of a participant's quality of life. Scores are chosen from a Likert scale from 1 to 7, with 1 representing &quot;all of the time&quot; and 7 representing &quot;none of the time.&quot; Scores would decrease if symptoms improved.</description>

             changes, odors, scents/perfumes, tickle, irritation in the throat/paralaryngeal&#xD;
             region, or talking.&#xD;

             listed below would be done as part of a standard clinical workup for chronic cough and&#xD;
             are not done specific to this study):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Reflux disease treatment with one of the following: failure of two months of PPIs&#xD;
