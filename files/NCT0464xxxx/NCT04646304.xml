    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to 1) identify motion capture variables that can be used to&#xD;
      differentiate surgical experience level and 2) evaluate if these variables can be used in a&#xD;
      surgical education setting to improve resident performance.&#xD;

      This will be a two-phase study that will take 2 years to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will recruit staff surgeons, surgical fellows, and residents from the departments of&#xD;
      Obstetrics and Gynecology, Urology, General Surgery, and Thoracics at The University of&#xD;
      Ottawa and The Ottawa Hospital to complete a set of FLS tasks. Logistic regressions will be&#xD;
      used to identify significant factors that differentiate surgical experience level (junior&#xD;
      residents, senior residents, fellows, and staff). Classification of residents will depend on&#xD;
      their current cohort in the CDB or traditional time-based system: A target interval will be&#xD;
      computed for each significant factor based on the staff surgeons' average performance. This&#xD;
      target interval will be used to assess resident performance in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will recruit Transition to Discipline residents from each department to complete 3&#xD;
      sets of FLS tasks. Participants will be randomized into an &quot;objective feedback&quot; group or a&#xD;
      &quot;no feedback&quot; group. Participants randomized to the objective feedback group will receive a&#xD;
      report that compares their performance in Set 1 to that of the staff surgeons' using the&#xD;
      target interval as a reference. Participants receiving objective feedback will then complete&#xD;
      Sets 2 and 3 knowing what factors to improve upon. Participants receiving no feedback will&#xD;
      complete all sets with no intervention. Phase 2 data collection will start once Phase 1 is&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trajectories of retro-reflective markers will be recorded using a 6-camera motion analysis&#xD;
      system (40MXF-40 Vicon cameras, Oxford Metrics, Oxford, UK) sampling at 100 Hz with&#xD;
      supporting Nexus software (v2, Oxford Metrics, Oxford, UK). Retro-reflective markers will be&#xD;
      placed on various anatomical landmarks on the participant's body based on a cluster marker&#xD;
      set. Laparoscopic surgical tools (grasper, scissors, or dissector) will have a marker triad&#xD;
      fixed to the upper shaft while a laparoscopic trainer (FLS Trainer System, Limbs &amp; Things,&#xD;
      Savannah GA) will have markers placed at its corners. Using Vicon Nexus software, raw marker&#xD;
      trajectories will be filtered and used to compute local coordinate systems of the upper body,&#xD;
      joint centers, and subsequent joint angles while filtered marker trajectories on the&#xD;
      laparoscopic tools will compute the tool tip's motion and orientation relative to the box&#xD;
      trainer's workspace. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will also be used to capture motion of&#xD;
      the upper body and compare to motion capture outcomes (Secondary Objective). Wireless IMUs&#xD;
      will be placed along the long axis of the forearm, upper arm, upper spine and lower spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface electromyography (EMG) signals of the biceps, triceps, anterior deltoid, upper&#xD;
      trapezius, wrist extensors and flexors will also be recorded using a wireless EMG system&#xD;
      (Trigno, Delsys Inc., Natick MA) and recorded using Nexus. Sensors will be placed over the&#xD;
      muscle bellies following SENIAM guidelines [34] and signals will be sample data 100Hz with a&#xD;
      20-450Hz bandpass. All experimental EMG signals will be appropriately conditioned and&#xD;
      normalized to maximum EMG value elicited during maximum voluntary isometric contraction&#xD;
      (MVIC) exercises. Three repetitions of each MVIC exercise will be performed before the&#xD;
      experimental task and will include elbow flexion and extension, arm abduction, arm flexion,&#xD;
      and wrist flexion and extension. A minimum of 30 seconds rest will be given between each&#xD;
      exercise to mitigate effects of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion and EMG data will be exported to a custom MatLab (2019, Mathworks, Natick, MA)&#xD;
      application to compute objective measures of laparoscopic performance: instrument tip&#xD;
      pathlength, average (±1 stdev) excursion velocity, average (±1 stdev) excursion error,&#xD;
      average (±1 stdev) upper body kinematics (shoulder, elbow, wrist, neck and trunk) in all&#xD;
      three planes of motion, and integrated EMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video of the surgical tasks will be recorded and synced to marker trajectory data using an&#xD;
      external trigger. Videos will be de-identified, and the last repetition assessed by three&#xD;
      staff surgeons. First, the raters will categorize each video as Transition to Discipline&#xD;
      resident, Foundation of Discipline resident, Core Discipline resident, Transition to Practice&#xD;
      resident, fellow, or staff surgeon based other their general perception of the performer's&#xD;
      experience level. The raters will then score each video following the FLS scoring system&#xD;
      (based on timing and penalty scores), and the OSATS evaluation grid.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1 will recruit 4 groups of participants that vary in surgical experience (junior residents, senior residents, surgical fellows, and staff surgeons). Significant differences in objective measures of surgical performance will be identified. A target interval will be computed for each significant factor based on the staff surgeons' average performance.&#xD;
Phase 2 will recruit junior residents to complete the same sets of surgical tasks. Half of the participants will receive objective feedback comparing their performance in Set 1 to the staff surgeons' target interval while the other half will receive no feedback. Differences in performance between Sets 1 and 3 will be quantified and compared between groups.</intervention_model_description>
