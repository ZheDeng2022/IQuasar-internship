  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of the environment on human health is considerable. An important factor is the&#xD;
      effect of temperature on the human body, where either the effects of short-term exposure to&#xD;
      extreme temperatures (cryotherapy, sauna, etc.) or the long-term environmental impact are&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was focused on research of the long-term effect of repeated CWI on atherogenesis,&#xD;
      lipid parameters and fat distribution.&#xD;

      This study was designed as a cohort observational studyfollowing the group of volunteers&#xD;
      practicing CWI. Totally forty volunteers agreed to participate in the study by signing the&#xD;
      informed consent, approved by the local ethics committee of UPJŠ Košice. Volunteers were&#xD;
      examined in Cardiology and General Medicine outpatient clinics of Faculty of medicine, UPJŠ&#xD;
      Košice (1st Department of Internal Medicine; outpatient clinics of Medicomp Košice Ltd.).&#xD;
      They underwent the anamnesis and examination with a focus in the first step on matching the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria: SCORE for the assessment of the cardiovascular risk as low (≤1%),&#xD;
      patients without the suspected diagnosis of the familialhypercholesterolemia, respectively&#xD;
      with TC level above 8 mmol/L, respectively TG concentrations above 2.3 mmol/L, male gender,&#xD;
      age between 21 and 60, signed informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with one or more exclusion criteria were not included: volunteers with&#xD;
      lipid-lowering therapy or those that received hypolipidemics in the period shorter than 3&#xD;
      months before the study, values of blood lipids outside the inclusion criteria, glucose&#xD;
      intolerance and DM,presence of advanced cardiovascular (plague or coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      TIA, stroke, etc.) or chronic inflammatory diseases, infection or diseases possible affecting&#xD;
      measured parameters and significant lifestyle changes in the last period of 6 months before&#xD;
      the CWI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial examination, 35 volunteers fulfilled the criteria. Volunteers of the study&#xD;
      underwent controlled, repeated CWI (5 months 15/11/18 - 15/03/19)based on a following&#xD;
      pre-prepared protocol in the cooperation of our physicians and the sport club: Full body CWI&#xD;
      in open standing, except the head (same location, timing), frequency three times a weekin the&#xD;
      duration of 7-10 minutes. Swimming was permitted. Volunteers must not use neoprene aids&#xD;
      (gloves, shoes), caps were allowed. Volunteers should be in the final phase submerged in&#xD;
      water, above which there should only be the head and neck. The upper limbs were below the&#xD;
      water surface. Non-neoprene footwear was permitted. Volunteers entered the water continuously&#xD;
      without stopping. The time of stay in water was calculated from the first contact of the foot&#xD;
      with water. On average, the whole body needed to be immersed in water within 30 seconds. The&#xD;
      entire study was performed in the nearby lake, where all participants in the active arm were&#xD;
      exposed to the same weather and water conditions, which were monitored. Volunteers who did&#xD;
      not follow the protocol in more than 15% of the episodes, respectively, with weight, fat or&#xD;
      muscle mass changes over 5%, with significant dietary changes were excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Equivalent sham control group (N=30) was included fulfilling the inclusion criteria, without&#xD;
      the CWI.&#xD;
