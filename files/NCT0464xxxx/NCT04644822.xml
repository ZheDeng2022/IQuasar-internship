      This is a prospective, Phase 3 non-randomized, open label, multi-centre clinical trial to&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of [18F]PSMA-1007 Injection (investigational product or IP) in&#xD;
      evaluating men with suspected persistent or recurrent disease (i.e., with biochemical&#xD;
      failure), but with negative or equivocal conventional re-staging imaging (bone scan [BS] and&#xD;
      computed tomography [CT] of abdomen and pelvis).&#xD;
