      Objectives: The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of phenytoin cream in&#xD;
      patients with neuropathic pain due to chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP). The&#xD;
      second objective is to determine the predictive value of a double-blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      response test (DOBRET) to identify sustained responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a 6-week enrichment randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      cross-over trial evaluating phenytoin cream in 72 participants with painful CIAP, whereafter&#xD;
      an open label extension phase is offered with phenytoin 20 percent cream for up to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline a DOBRET with phenytoin 10 percent and placebo cream will be performed in each&#xD;
      study participant to stratify participants according to their response to the DOBRET before&#xD;
      entering the double-blind cross-over phase. DOBRET positive participants are those who&#xD;
      experience at least two points pain reduction on the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) on&#xD;
      the phenytoin 10 percent cream applied area within 30 minutes and at least one-point&#xD;
      difference in pain reduction on the NRS between phenytoin 10 percent and placebo cream&#xD;
      applied area, in favour of the former.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the randomized cross-over trial phase, 48 DOBRET positive participants will enter the&#xD;
      DOBRET positive group and 24 DOBRET negative participants the DOBRET negative group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive three treatments in a double blind fashion and in a randomized&#xD;
      order: phenytoin 10 percent, phenytoin 20 percent and placebo cream. The duration of each&#xD;
      treatment period is two weeks. Participants will cross-over two times to each of the other&#xD;
      treatments. The study does not have wash-out periods between treatments, because the mean&#xD;
      duration of analgesic effect after an application is expected to be less than nine hours. A&#xD;
      blood sample will be collected at the end of the second week of the first treatment period to&#xD;
      test for phenytoin plasma levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The investigators aim to include 72 participants, age 40 years or older,&#xD;
      who have been diagnoses with painful CIAP at the University Medical Center Utrecht and fulfil&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and have given written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Phenytoin cream in concentrations of 10 percent and 20 percent cream compared&#xD;
      to placebo cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Change in pain intensity from baseline NRS to the mean NRS in the second&#xD;
      week in DOBRET positive participants.&#xD;
