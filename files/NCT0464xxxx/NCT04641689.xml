  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will examine the effectiveness of an intervention to reduce sedentary behavior&#xD;
      in Kansas State University employees who are primarily working from home. We will recruit 100&#xD;
      employees to participate. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions:&#xD;
      desk only, program only, desk + program, or waitlist control. The program will consist of&#xD;
      strategies to reduce sitting and increase physical activity in the home environment. We will&#xD;
      assess whether the intervention successfully elicits reductions in sitting among employees,&#xD;
      as well as changes in cardiometabolic and work-related outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this project we will conduct a 12-week intervention that incorporates multiple strategies&#xD;
      to reduce sedentary behavior among university employees who are primarily working from home.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via campus networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend an initial testing visit, during which anthropometric and health&#xD;
      outcome data (blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol) will be collected. Following the&#xD;
      testing visit, all participants will complete an activity log for the next 5 work days, and a&#xD;
      subsample will wear an activPAL 4 device for 7 days. All participants will complete a series&#xD;
      of questionnaires (measuring physical activity, fatigue, stress, productivity, mood, and&#xD;
      diet) online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all baseline data have been collected, participants will be randomized to one of four&#xD;
      conditions: desk only, program only, desk + program, or waitlist control. Those in the desk&#xD;
      only and desk+program conditions will receive a height-adjustable desk. They will be asked to&#xD;
      set up the desk at their home workstation and send a photo of the setup to our research team&#xD;
      within one week. Those in the program only and control conditions will receive their&#xD;
      height-adjustable desks after completing the post-intervention assessments. Participants&#xD;
      assigned to the program only and desk+program conditions will have access to a website that&#xD;
      includes a variety of resources for reducing sedentary behavior and increasing physical&#xD;
      activity in the home environment. The intervention program will be based on social cognitive&#xD;
      theory and will be designed to promote self-efficacy, self-regulation, positive outcome&#xD;
      expectations, and social and environmental support. Participants will complete weekly modules&#xD;
      that include activities such as goal setting and self-monitoring, action and coping planning,&#xD;
      group discussions, etc. The program will also provide suggestions for changes to the home&#xD;
      work environment, access to virtual stretching and strengthening videos, examples of&#xD;
      technology to prompt breaks, etc. Participants will also receive 2 small group coaching calls&#xD;
      via Zoom (at 3 and 8 weeks) to assist them in setting goals for reducing sedentary behavior&#xD;
      and overcoming barriers. Participants in the desk only and waitlist control groups will&#xD;
      receive access to the program after completing the post-intervention assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measures will be repeated following the 12-week intervention.&#xD;
