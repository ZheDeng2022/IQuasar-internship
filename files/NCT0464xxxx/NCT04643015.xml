  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see how we can prevent problems caused by movement during the MRI&#xD;
      scan. Different ways of doing the scan (techniques) will be tested to see if they are&#xD;
      practical and can prevent problems related to motion. For example, changes in the timing of&#xD;
      the magnetic field and the radio waves will be examined, and at changes in the way a computer&#xD;
      is used to process the images. The new techniques will be compared with the techniques that&#xD;
      are usually used.&#xD;

    <description>Briefly, new MRI sequences will be used on a patient who is undergoing a scheduled, clinically necessary MRI exam. Any new research sequence will be scanned in addition to the clinically required sequences and will not interfere with the clinical scan other than requiring five to ten minutes of additional &quot;table time&quot;. There will be no invasive measures under this protocol.</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,&#xD;
        the protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center&#xD;
        (MSK). With consultation of the clinical team, the investigator or a consenting&#xD;
        professional from the research team will go to the treating physician's clinic to discuss&#xD;
        the study and consent the patient in person.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of any age, including males and females, who are being treated in the&#xD;
             Department of Pediatrics and are already scheduled to undergo MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone who would normally be excluded from undergoing an MRI examination as per&#xD;
             Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases Screening Questionnaire for MRI&#xD;
             (Appendix A). Subjects with pacemakers or aneurysm clips that are MRI conditional or&#xD;
             MRI compatible may enroll in the study if the study is clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to comply or complete the MRI exam due to claustrophobia or&#xD;
             high levels of anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients at higher risk due to age, frailty, or the emergent nature of their condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are undergoing MRI only of the head, neck or spine&#xD;
