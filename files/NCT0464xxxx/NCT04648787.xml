    <textblock>
      To explore the intervention effect of family participatory nursing on the uncertainty of&#xD;
      illness of parents of hospitalized premature infants, and to evaluate the uncertainty level&#xD;
      of parents of premature infants in different stages. The study will be described the feeling&#xD;
      of parents of premature infants after family participation nursing through interview. We will&#xD;
      provide support for families of premature infants, and then to provide support for growth and&#xD;
      development of premature infants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Most of the current management mode of restricting or forbidding visiting in neonatology,&#xD;
      parents can not establish the perception of premature infants and lack of communication with&#xD;
      medical staff, which will lead to negative emotions represented by uncertainty of disease.The&#xD;
      research on uncertainty of disease started late in China, mostly used in tumor, epilepsy and&#xD;
      congenital heart disease. The research on parents of NICU children mostly focused on the&#xD;
      analysis of influencing factors of uncertainty of disease, lacking intervention research, and&#xD;
      the measures were only the information support mode based on health education. We want to&#xD;
      explore the intervention effect of family participatory nursing on the uncertainty of illness&#xD;
      of parents of hospitalized premature infants, and to evaluate the uncertainty level of&#xD;
      parents of premature infants in different stages. Describe the feeling of parents of&#xD;
      premature infants after family participation nursing through interview. We will provide&#xD;
      support for families of premature infants, and then to provide support for growth and&#xD;
      development of premature infants.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The total Scores of PPUS(Parents' Perception of Uncertainty Scale )</measure>
    <time_frame>from adminssion to discharge (almostly 14 hospitalization days )</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is one of a series of uncertainty scales developed by Mishel in 1998 under the guidance of uncertainty theory of disease, which is one of the series of uncertainty scales for different groups of people. Its content includes 4 dimensions, 31 items, unclear (13 items), complexity (9 items), lack of information (5 items), and unpredictable (4 items). It includes one score from 4 dimensions adding. The score is much higher, the parents maybe feel more uncertainty.According to the response of the responders, from &quot;completely disagree&quot; to &quot;completely agree&quot;, the total score is &quot;31-155&quot;. The higher the score is, the stronger the uncertainty of the disease is. When the total score is more than 50% of the highest score, the responders are considered to have higher uncertainty of the disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Scores of Family satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>The 30th day after discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>Likert 5-point method was used to score, that is, 2 = very dissatisfied, 4 = dissatisfied, 6 = average, 8 = satisfied and 10 = very satisfied. The satisfaction level of each question was quantified by scoring.satisfied, satisfied and very satisfied with the score of inpatient satisfaction in the total number of discharged children.</description>

    <time_frame>The 30th day after discharge.</time_frame>

    <description>One week after admission, the parents of premature infants were informed by telephone one day in advance to enter the ward for family participation nursing, and the guidance of daily life nursing for premature infants was given on the same day, including hand hygiene, breast feeding, pacification, changing diapers, bathing and establishment of parent-child relationship. Before discharge, theparents of premature infants should be informed by telephone one day in advance to enter the ward again for family participation nursing, and half a day's guidance was given, including observation and treatment of common symptoms and signs, guidance of home safety prevention and learning to write diary of premature infants.</description>
