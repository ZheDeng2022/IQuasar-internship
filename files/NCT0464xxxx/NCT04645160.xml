  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive cancer of the bile ducts. People with CCA have few&#xD;
      treatment options and poor survival. Researchers want to see if a new drug can stop or slow&#xD;
      CCA growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find the safest and most effective dose of tivozanib to treat CCA and learn its overall&#xD;
      response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with CCA not removable with surgery and have been treated with at&#xD;
      least one type of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of their ability to do daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medicine review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests, including thyroid function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram, to check heart function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomography scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some screening tests may be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to enroll in protocol #13C0176. This will allow any remaining&#xD;
      tumor or blood samples to be used in future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take tivozanib by mouth, once a day for 21 days per cycle or every other&#xD;
      day per cycle. Each cycle is 28 days. They can take the drug until they have bad side&#xD;
      effects, their CCA gets worse, or if they become pregnant. They will record their blood&#xD;
      pressure twice daily at home. They will also keep a medication diary of each dose of&#xD;
      tivozanib they take and any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have study visits before starting each new cycle and every 8 weeks. They&#xD;
      will also have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends at NIH, or if they are unable&#xD;
      to come to NIH by phone, videocall, or other NIH-approved platform. Then they will be&#xD;
      contacted 6 and 12 months later, and then once a year.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive biliary tract malignancy that remains a clinical&#xD;
      challenge with limited treatment options and poor survival. Combination chemotherapy with&#xD;
      gemcitabine and cisplatin is the most validated first-line treatment, but the response rate&#xD;
      approaches only 22% and median progression free survival is 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytoplasmic accumulation of the nuclear export protein exportin 7, XPO7, portends poor&#xD;
      outcomes for patients with cholangiocarcinoma. Using pre-clinical models, we established XPO7&#xD;
      as an oncogenic driver in CCA cells and determined that this biology is driven by the&#xD;
      interaction between XPO7 and a hitherto incompletely studied kinase, Ste-20 like kinase&#xD;
      (SLK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      XPO7 binds to and promotes cytoplasmic localization and stabilization of SLK, which in turn&#xD;
      activates oncogenic AKT signaling. Targeting SLK expression via short hairpin RNA abrogates&#xD;
      tumor formation in 3D culture and mice models, and leads to robust inhibition of AKT Ser 473&#xD;
      phosphorylation, establishing SLK as a novel, bona fide target in cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pan-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor tivozanib, which also&#xD;
      demonstrated activity against SLK in our in vitro screen, reduced AKT phosphorylation and&#xD;
      abrogated growth of CCA tumorspheres and in a murine xenograft model. Additionally, we&#xD;
      evaluated tivozanib in our ex vivo tumor platform using a liver metastasis from a patient&#xD;
      with XPO7-expressing cholangiocarcinoma and documented effective tumor cell degeneration and&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As reliable, molecular-targeted regimens either for first- or second-line therapy for&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma have remained elusive, these results support evaluation of tivozanib as a&#xD;
      treatment option for patients with cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: To determine safety and establish the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of tivozanib&#xD;
      in patients with cholangiocarcinoma who were previously treated with first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: To determine the overall response rate (RECIST) of tivozanib in patients with&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma who were previously treated with first-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed cholangiocarcinoma not amenable to&#xD;
      resection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous treatment with 1st line chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status of &lt;=1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preserved hepatic function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, single-center, non-randomized Phase I/II study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial will begin with enrollment in a Phase I two dose-level, intra-patient dose escalation&#xD;
      and possible dose de-escalation phase to determine safety and RP2D, followed by a Simon&#xD;
      minimax two-stage Phase II trial design to determine efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is in cycles of 28 days, 3 weeks on, 1 week off (except for patients in DL-1, with&#xD;
      every other day dosing). Treatment evaluations for efficacy will be every 2 months (8 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual ceiling will be set at 30 patients&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Clinically meaningful ascites defined as ascites requiring non-pharmacologic&#xD;
             intervention (e.g., paracentesis) to maintain symptomatic control, within 6 months&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Therapeutic anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy with the exception of low&#xD;
             molecular weight heparin or aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Pregnant or lactating women. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because based&#xD;
             on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, tivozanib can cause fetal harm&#xD;
             when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration&#xD;
             of tivozanib to pregnant rats caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-&#xD;
             fetal mortality. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with tivozanib, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with tivozanib. These potential risks&#xD;
             may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Treatment with systemic hormonal therapy within 3 weeks prior to start of protocol&#xD;
             therapy, with the exception of:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Nasal, ophthalmic, inhaled and topical steroid preparations&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oral replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Low-dose maintenance steroid therapy (equivalent of prednisone 10 mg/day) for&#xD;
                  other conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
