  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EYEdeal Scanning Technology enables rapid measurement of corneal and scleral topography. By&#xD;
      accurately measuring the ocular surface with this imaging technology, the current iterative&#xD;
      fitting method required to fit PROSE (prosthetic replacement of the ocular surface ecosystem)&#xD;
      devices could be replaced and/or strengthened with a more rapid, automated fitting sequence.&#xD;
      This could considerably reduce the time needed per visit, the number of visits, and the&#xD;
      number of devices needed to be manufactured to reach the endpoint. Additionally, the scanning&#xD;
      technology may afford the opportunity to successfully fit some pathology that were previously&#xD;
      treatment failures. The automated technology may as well reduce the intensive clinician&#xD;
      training time needed to fit PROSE devices, therefore increasing the availability and access&#xD;
      to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to evaluate the reliability and efficacy of this automated&#xD;
      technology for fitting PROSE devices. Data from real-time measurement of the human eye ocular&#xD;
      surface topography will be used to fabricate a prosthetic lens. The fit of the PROSE device&#xD;
      will be evaluated, as well as the subjective comfort of the fit.&#xD;

           with the subject's participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Has had previous ocular surgery within the past 12 weeks&#xD;
