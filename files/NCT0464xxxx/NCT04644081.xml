  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to test the feasibility, acceptability, cultural appropriateness and&#xD;
      effectiveness of LTP+CaCBT for treating postnatal depression and to enhance the mental health&#xD;
      and wellbeing of mothers and their children in the low-income areas of Jos Nigeria. This&#xD;
      project also aims to provide primary healthcare workers with culturally sensitive requisite&#xD;
      skills and support to embed the proposed intervention into routine care practice and increase&#xD;
      access to evidence-based intervention.&#xD;

      Participants who scored 10 or above on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and tested&#xD;
      positive for postnatal depression on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) would be&#xD;
      recruited randomly assigned into two groups in each of the four primary health care (PHC)&#xD;
      facilities designated for the present study. Groups one will receive the LTP+CaCBT treatment&#xD;
      - the intervention will consist of a total of 12 (social distancing) group training sessions&#xD;
      (60-90 minutes). Groups two will receive routine treatment as usual (TAU) currently available&#xD;
      in the PHC facilities (e.g. antidepressants) in the selected communities. Each group will&#xD;
      comprise of approximately 10 mother-child pairs.&#xD;
