    <textblock>
      Screening Wizard (SW). Primary Care Providers (PCPs) are often uncertain about how to best&#xD;
      refer adolescents who screen positive for depression or suicidality. Screen-positive youth&#xD;
      who are either not in treatment, or express dissatisfaction with current treatment will be&#xD;
      consented by an on-site research assistant (RA). Participants will answer questions via&#xD;
      adaptive screens developed in a previous NIMH study (MH100155) for suicidal risk, anxiety,&#xD;
      and mania. These will address perceived barriers and preferences about treatment.&#xD;
      Participants are then randomized into 1 of 3 groups: 1) Providing the symptoms scores report&#xD;
      of results to their provider based on their Screening Wizard responses (Screening as Usual);&#xD;
      2) Providing the symptoms scores report and their responses to treatment preferences and&#xD;
      barriers including treatment recommendations their provider might suggest (Screening Wizard&#xD;
      2.0); or 3) Providing the report with treatment recommendations to their provider and a&#xD;
      website called SOVA or Supporting Our Valued Adolescent, that is aimed at addressing&#xD;
      perceptions about mental health providing support to teens through peer interaction that&#xD;
      social workers and doctors moderate on a 24 hour a day basis (Screening Wizard 2.0 + SOVA).&#xD;

      Screening Wizard will be delivered by Primary Care Providers (PCPs) at well child visits,&#xD;
      beginning with screening occurring within the waiting room which will yield decision support&#xD;
      guidance delivered and followed by the PCP at the same visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment of Interventions: This study will randomize participants to one of three&#xD;
      conditions in a 2:2:1 randomization scheme to either receive &quot;screening as usual&quot; (n=20),&#xD;
      Screening Wizard 2.0 (n=40), or Screening Wizard 2.0 + SOVA (n =40)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: H1: Screening Wizard 2.0 will result in more referrals compared to &quot;screening as&#xD;
      usual&quot; (increase &gt;30% compared to &quot;screening as usual&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Screening Wizard 2.0 will result in higher rates of follow-through with mental health&#xD;
      services compared to &quot;screening as usual&quot; (increase &gt;30% compared to &quot;screening as usual&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Screening Wizard 2.0 will have higher patient satisfaction compared to &quot;screening as&#xD;
      usual&quot; (SW satisfaction &gt; &quot;screening as usual&quot; satisfaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: Adolescent and parents in Screening Wizard 2.0 + SOVA will have less negative attitudes&#xD;
      about psychotherapy, higher depression literacy, and a higher readiness for treatment as&#xD;
      compared to Screening Wizard 2.0 alone or &quot;screening as usual&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      H5: Adolescent and parents in Screening Wizard 2.0 + SOVA will result in higher rates of&#xD;
      follow-through with mental health services (defined as attendance at an initial appointment)&#xD;
      compared to Screening wizard 2.0 alone (increase &gt;10%) and &quot;screening as usual&quot; (increase&#xD;
      &gt;40%)&#xD;

    <description>The rate of personalized referrals by primary care providers and treatment initiation among adolescents who screen positive for depression or suicidal ideation will be monitored to determine if provider made referrals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost Effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline phone visit</time_frame>
    <description>The following information on the incremental cost effectiveness of Screening Wizard will be gathered from the electronic health record (EHR) and the Child and Adolescent Service Assessment (CASA): (a) the direct costs of the intervention, including intervention (labor, equipment, supplies, facilities); (b) the total treatment as usual service use and expense for each participant the study arm using HER and CASA data; and (c) family costs (out-of-pocket expenses, parent missed time from work).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability &amp; Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>At exit interview after Baseline phone visit. The Baseline visit occurs 24-48 hours after initial screening and the exit interview call will be make within 1 month following the completion of the Baseline phone assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction to Screening Wizard will be assessed through questions developed by investigators to understand experience with the program. Questions investigators have adapted from literature reviews on satisfaction include: &quot;If a friend were in need of a mental health referral, would you recommend Screening Wizard to him/her?; How satisfied are you with the amount of help you received?; Have the services you received helped you to deal more effectively with your problems?&quot;. The response options include: No, definitely not; No, I don't think so; Yes, I think so; Yes, definitely.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with Technical Components</measure>
    <time_frame>At exit interview after Baseline phone visit. The Baseline visit occurs 24-48 hours after initial screening and the exit interview call will be make within 1 month following the completion of the Baseline phone assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with the technical components of interventions will be assessed through the certain questions from the Post System Satisfaction and Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). The PSSUQ is 19 items with response options ranging from 1 to 7 where 1= strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree. The PSSUQ has sub-scores derived from subsets of the questions which reflect system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality. Questions from sub-domains were chosen to tailor the questioning to this particular intervention.</description>
