  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical resection is thought to be the mainstay of esophageal cancer treatment. Neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery has become the standard treatment option for&#xD;
      locally advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). However, only 20% to 40% of patients&#xD;
      can achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant CRT with favorable prognosis&#xD;
      and about 10% of patients have disease progression after chemoradiotherapy. How to improve&#xD;
      the the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy is an important clinical problem to be solved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy targeting the programmed cell death receptor-1（PD-1） /programmed cell&#xD;
      death-Ligand 1(PD-L1) checkpoints has demonstrated promising activity in ESCC. In Keynote181&#xD;
      study, for patients with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, regardless of PD-L1&#xD;
      expression, pembrolizumab significantly improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy.&#xD;
      However, the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy therapy in surgery-based multidisciplinary&#xD;
      treatment of local advanced esophageal cancer still need a lot of clinical studies to further&#xD;
      confirm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of Toripalimab combined with&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy in neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;

      This study was designed as an open-lable, single-arm, single-center,exploratory clinical&#xD;
      study. Toripalimab combination of chemoradiotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy. Participants will&#xD;
      receive carboplatin (AUC=2) and paclitaxel liposome (50mg/m²) on day 3,10,17,24,31. And&#xD;
      radiotherapy Intensity-modulated radiation therapy（IMRT）will start from day 1 to 31 of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. A total of 41.4 Gy, 23 fractions of 1.8 Gy. Participants will also receive&#xD;
      Toripalimab (240mg) on days 3, 24and 45. After the neoadjuvant treatment is over, the&#xD;
      short-term efficacy evaluation will be performed first, and then a radical resection will be&#xD;
      scheduled on Day 59 to 73. This study include 2 phases: 14 cases were enrolled in the first&#xD;
      stage and 18 cases were enrolled in the second stage.&#xD;
