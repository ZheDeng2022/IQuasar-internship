  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T&#xD;
      lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or&#xD;
      programmed death ligand 1 (PD- L1)) have revolutionized the treatment of many cancers. The&#xD;
      widespread use of these treatments has triggered a new spectrum of immune related adverse&#xD;
      events (irAE). Several cases of bullous pemphigoid (BP) triggered by antiPD-1/PDL-1 therapy&#xD;
      have been reported, and their characteristics are currently poorly described in the&#xD;
      literature. The investigators sought to collect the French cases of BP triggered by&#xD;
      antiPD-1/PDL-1 therapy, and to describe their clinical, biological and histological&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this national, retrospective, observational study, investigators included patients treated&#xD;
      with antiPD-1/PDL-1 therapy, with a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid occurring during&#xD;
      treatment or up to 12 months after its discontinuation. Diagnosis of BP was made by the&#xD;
      dermatologist and was based on the following criteria: compatible clinical presentation,&#xD;
      compatible histopathology findings, positive direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies,&#xD;
      positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay BP180/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay BP230.&#xD;

      All members of French study Group on Autoimmune Bullous Skin Diseases and French group of&#xD;
      Onco-dermatology were asked to report cases of bullous pemphigoid induced by antiPD-1/PDL-1&#xD;
      therapy from 2014 to 2019. In this retrospective, observational cohort study, investigators&#xD;
      included patients treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, with a diagnosis of bullous&#xD;
      pemphigoid occurring during treatment or up to 12 months after its discontinuation. Diagnosis&#xD;
      of BP was made by the dermatologist and was based on the following criteria developed by the&#xD;
      French Bullous Study Group : compatible clinical presentation (absence of atrophic scars,&#xD;
      absence of mucosal involvement and absence of predominant bullous lesions on the neck and&#xD;
      head), compatible histopathology findings (subepidermal blister on skin biopsy; and linear&#xD;
      deposits of IgG and C3 along the basement-membrane zone), positive DIF studies, positive&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay BP180/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay BP230. For each&#xD;
      case, collected data were : sex, type of tumor, type of checkpoint inhibitor, age at the&#xD;
      onset of the checkpoint inhibitor, time from the onset of BP compared to the onset of the&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibitor, clinical presentation of BP, results of complementary exams (skin biopsies,&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for BP180 and BP230 and indirect immunofluorescence studies&#xD;
      if available); treatment of BP used, consequence on antiPD-1/PD-L1 therapy, course of the&#xD;
      tumor, other irAEs. Overall tumor response was determined by the treating oncologist and&#xD;
      classified using RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors).&#xD;
