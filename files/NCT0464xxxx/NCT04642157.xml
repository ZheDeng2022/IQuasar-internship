  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ORIAS is a randomized controlled trial designed to study the efficacy of the ELIOS system in&#xD;
      reducing suicidality in the AYA, reinforcing their motivation to seek help and making them&#xD;
      access to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As ELIOS would be the first suicide prevention system worldwide entirely tailored to the AYA&#xD;
      contemporaneous modes of interaction on social media, ORIAS was designed to address the&#xD;
      challenge of deciding whether this innovation is worth adding to the current national and&#xD;
      international prevention arsenal. While randomized control trials are crucially lacking in&#xD;
      the field of suicide prevention, especially on the Internet, the high-level evidence that&#xD;
      ORIAS is expected to bring could have a decisive influence on how the French prevention&#xD;
      strategies will seize the social media.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ELIOS will consist in a digital system that distressed users can contact via different social&#xD;
      media or traditional communication channels. Participants randomized to the ELIOS group will&#xD;
      be offered to interact online with a web-clinician who will deliver adapted interventions to&#xD;
      alleviate their distress and refer them to appropriate care.The ELIOS web-clinicians will be&#xD;
      psychologists and nurses supervised by a psychiatrist, specially trained to carry out crisis,&#xD;
      counselling and motivational at distance interventions with AYA. In addition, they will&#xD;
      receive a special training module dedicated to the interaction constraints and possibilities&#xD;
      that the social media imply, but also to the textual and iconographic communication&#xD;
      modalities. Human resources of ELIOS will be shared with those of the VigilanS program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ORIAS study primarily aims at showing the superiority of the ELIOS system in decreasing&#xD;
      suicidality at 3 months in comparison to simple professional contact delivery among the AYA&#xD;
      who seek help online for suicidal ideations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With that purpose, participants will be randomly allocated to 2 parallel arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to receiving the same generic mental health resources as in the control&#xD;
           group, the participants of the ELIOS arm will benefit from the intervention of the ELIOS&#xD;
           team. This includes an initial systematic contact with an ELIOS web-clinician,&#xD;
           systematic recontacts by the ELIOS web-clinicians, scheduled at 24h, 72h and/or 7 days,&#xD;
           depending on the participants' level of suicide risk and the opportunity to&#xD;
           spontaneously contact the ELIOS system and get in contact with a web-clinician. All the&#xD;
           ELIOS interventions will be subordinated to the two main goals of reducing the users'&#xD;
           distress and suicidality and achieving an effective referral to the mental health care&#xD;
           services. To do so, the web-clinicians will variably combine three complementary&#xD;
           psychotherapeutic techniques: crisis intervention, counselling and motivational&#xD;
           guidance. The interventions will be constrained by the imperative of rapidly bringing&#xD;
           the participants from social media channels to more engaging channels (phone call or&#xD;
           video-conference) in order to gain degrees of freedom in the interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants of the control arm will receive generic professional help contacts. Three&#xD;
           types of resources will be suggested via the ELIOS website: the General Practitioner&#xD;
           (GP), the closest Medical and Psychological Center, the emergency services. The order of&#xD;
           presentation of the resource contacts will depend on the participants' intensity of&#xD;
           suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, data will be collected by means of online self-questionnaire before the&#xD;
      intervention or provision of resource contacts (T0) and 3 months later (T1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As primary efficacy analysis, the change in the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale&#xD;
      Intensity of Ideation-subscale score between baseline and M3 will be compared between the 2&#xD;
      arms using the constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model. To take into account the&#xD;
      stratified factor considered in randomization, gender will be included as a covariate in the&#xD;
      cLDA model. The treatment effect (mean between-arms difference in the 3-months change from&#xD;
      baseline) will be estimated by the time-by-arm interaction. If normality of the model&#xD;
      residuals is not satisfied (despite the log-transformation of the data), non-parametric&#xD;
      analysis will be used; absolute changes between baseline and M3 will be calculated and&#xD;
      compared between the 2 arms using non-parametric analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline&#xD;
      values. Primary analysis will be conducted according to the ITT principle after handling&#xD;
      missing values. A complete case-analysis will be performed as sensitivity analysis. In a&#xD;
      second sensitivity analysis, the primary endpoint will be compared between the 2 arms by&#xD;
      including in the cLDA model pre-specified covariates known for their association with&#xD;
      suicidal behaviors, namely age, regular consumption of tobacco, regular consumption of&#xD;
      alcohol, regular consumption of drugs, known pre-existing psychiatric disorder and personal&#xD;
      history of suicide attempt. The necessary subjects number is 386 (193 per arm).&#xD;
