  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the phase 2 portion of this study is to select a biologically-active ASP0367&#xD;
      dose level by pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluation. The phase 2 portion&#xD;
      of this study will also assess the safety and tolerability of ASP0367.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the phase 3 portion of this study is to assess the effect of ASP0367 on&#xD;
      functional improvement relative to placebo and will also assess the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of ASP0367 relative to placebo. The phase 3 portion of this study will also assess the effect&#xD;
      of ASP0367 on functional improvement and fatigue relative to placebo and will assess the&#xD;
      effect of ASP0367 in overall participant functioning relative to placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy (i.e., functional improvement) will be assessed by a functional motor test, 6-minute&#xD;
      walk test (6MWT). The study consists of the following portions: screening (4 weeks); phase 2&#xD;
      dose selection portion with 2 doses of ASP0367 versus matching placebo (2 weeks); phase 3&#xD;
      portion with selected, single dose treatment versus placebo (up to 52 weeks); open-label&#xD;
      extension (OLE) (24 weeks); and follow-up (4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the phase 2 portion of the study, participants will be randomly placed into 1 of 3&#xD;
      arms (low dose ASP0367, high dose ASP0367 or placebo). Based on the PK and PD data, the&#xD;
      relevant dose level will be selected for the phase 3 portion of the study. Participants will&#xD;
      maintain their original dose level unless emerging safety, tolerability and/or PK data&#xD;
      necessitates dose modification, and no new participants will be enrolled in the study until&#xD;
      the phase 3 dose is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the phase 3 dose is selected, all participants except placebo group will switch to the&#xD;
      selected dose level of ASP0367 for the remainder of the phase 3 portion of the study (up to a&#xD;
      total 52 weeks including the phase 2 portion). Participants who were originally assigned to&#xD;
      placebo will remain on placebo for up to 52 weeks. The remaining enrollment of participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to either ASP0367 or matching placebo at a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who have completed the phase 3 portion of the study and are eligible for the&#xD;
      OLE will be offered the opportunity to take ASP0367 for an additional 24 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Phase 2 and Phase 3 portions: Safety and tolerability assessed by nature, frequency and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment emergent adverse events will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). A TEAE is defined as an adverse event (AE) observed after starting administration of the investigational product (IP) to 28 days after last dose of IP or moving to the OLE, whichever comes first. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of IP, whether or not considered related to the IP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP. This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the study procedures.</description>
