  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic mini/one anastomosis gastric bypass (MGB/OAGB) is a relatively new bariatric&#xD;
      procedure and is gaining ground over the surgical approach for morbid obesity as a safe and&#xD;
      effective operation. Revision of MGB/OAGB was never studied before as multicenter data&#xD;
      collection: we collected data from 21 italian centers who perform MGB/OAGB to evaluate&#xD;
      patients' conditions which determinated the conversion from this procedure to another kind of&#xD;
      bariatric technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MGB / OAGB has been shown to be an effective and safe bariatric technique. Despite that, the&#xD;
      complications of this procedure have already been extensively described in the literature.&#xD;
      Our goal is to collect data from 21 Italian centers that practice MGB / OAGB to evaluate the&#xD;
      reasons and complications that led surgeons to revise this surgery with a subsequent&#xD;
      bariatric procedure. For this reason we have analyzed the data provided by the centers on&#xD;
      8676 patients undergoing MGB / OAGB, focusing attention on phenomena such as GERD,&#xD;
      anastomotic stenosis, bleeding and marginal ulcers which are the most frequent causes of&#xD;
      re-intervention. We also evaluated the changes in BMI between the primary procedure and the&#xD;
      revision procedure to ensure that the bariatric purpose of the surgical program was&#xD;
      maintained.&#xD;
