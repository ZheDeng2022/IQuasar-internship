      We intend to recruit individuals who are referred for a routine screening in the primary&#xD;
      prevention outpatient clinic of Attikon University hospital, Athens According to&#xD;
      institutional protocols, a detailed medical history for atherosclerotic risk factors and&#xD;
      current medication is recorded and a baseline clinical examination is performed. Moreover&#xD;
      fasting blood samples are drawn to diagnose the presence of diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia. Glycocalyx examination is performed at the same visit. The subjects are&#xD;
      revaluated at one month and then followed up according to the attending physician's&#xD;
      instructions. All subjects are followed up for adverse events (death, stroke, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, hospitalization for heart failure) for 6 years after enrollment via telephonic&#xD;
      contact and planned appointment at the outpatient clinic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Blood pressure is measured in each subject with the aid of a digital oscillometric&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer (TensioMed, Budapest Hungary, Ltd). Each subject rests in a quiet room at&#xD;
      25°C for 30 minutes before the examination. The cuff is placed in the right arm, while the&#xD;
      subject is seated. The diagnosis of hypertension is made on the basis of:1) systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure ≥140 mmHg/diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg after 3 consecutive measurements or 2)&#xD;
      the participant is receiving antihypertensive treatment. Moreover fasting blood samples are&#xD;
      drawn to identify the presence of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia in our sample.&#xD;
      Specifically, DM is determined by either plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl measured by the enzymatic&#xD;
      in vitro test (Roche, automatic chemistry clinical analyzer) or treatment with antidiabetic&#xD;
      agents . Similarly, hyperlipidemia was defined by either Total Cholesterol ≥230 mg/dl, and/or&#xD;
      LDL ≥160 mg/dl, and /or TGs ≥200 mg /dl measured by the colorimetric spectrophotometry (Roche&#xD;
      Diagnostics) or the use of lipid lowering agents according to the running guidelines held&#xD;
      during the initial examination. Additionally, smokers are considered only those participants&#xD;
      who are actively smoking at the time of enrollment . Also, the presence of positive family&#xD;
      history of coronary artery disease is defined as coronary disease in a first degree female&#xD;
      relative before 65 years or a male relative before 55 years of age. BMI is calculated as the&#xD;
      ratio of weight (kg) to the square of height (m2). Furthermore, we use the SCORE estimation&#xD;
      system to calculate the 10-year cardiovascular risk for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as ethnicity is concerned, an individual is not considered Greek in case he/she was&#xD;
      born abroad and also has at least a foreigner parent or he/she is born in Greece but both&#xD;
      parents were foreigners. Inversely, a subject was considered Greek if they and simultaneously&#xD;
      both parents were born in Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are the history of Coronary artery disease (CAD), Peripheral Arterial&#xD;
      Disease (PAD), Heart failure (HF), Stroke, hepatic or renal failure, active neoplasia and&#xD;
      poorly controlled DM, defined as Hba1C&gt;7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDOTHELIAL GLYCOCALYX EVALUATION We quantify the perfused boundary region (PBR, measured in&#xD;
      μm) of the sublingual microvasculature by using Sideview Darkfield Imaging (Microscan,&#xD;
      Glycocheck, Microvascular Health Solutions Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) . Briefly, SDF&#xD;
      camera utilizes green reflected light emitting diode (LED) light (540 nm) from hemoglobin&#xD;
      molecules to depict the radial displacements of RBCs within the microvessels . The camera is&#xD;
      inserted under the tongue and captures more than 3000 vascular segments of vessels with&#xD;
      diameter ranging from 5 μm to 25 μm. The images are obtained automatically by the Glycocheck&#xD;
      software . Afterwards the system checks the quality of the recordings and selects the valid&#xD;
      frames (contrast enhancement greater than 60%), which are going to be further analyzed . The&#xD;
      RBC column width, as well as the total perfused diameter of microvessels is estimated by the&#xD;
      software with high accuracy. Then PBR is calculated by the formula [Perfused Diameter- RBC&#xD;
      column width]/2.The software also provides the PBR of vessels with diameter 5-9μm, 10-19μm,&#xD;
      20-25μm and the mean 5-25μm As a result, PBR expresses the outer area of the vessels' lumen&#xD;
      that is vulnerable to RBC penetration and is consistent with the integrity of glycocalyx&#xD;
      layer. Thus, high PBR values are considered as indicator of damaged endothelial glycocalyx&#xD;
      with affected barrier properties, which allows high spatio-temporal distribution of RBCs. On&#xD;
      the other hand Conversely, low PBR values are associated with robust thick glycocalyx layer.&#xD;
      The whole procedure lasts for approximately 3 minutes, does not require high expertise, is&#xD;
      operator independent, has satisfactory reproducibility and thus is highly recommended as a&#xD;
      validated technique for the assessment of endothelial glycocalyx function . The PBR&#xD;
      measurements are independent of red blood cell filling of the vessels segments (hematocrit),&#xD;
      because the software only includes vessel segments that have a filling percentage of more&#xD;
      than 50%. Hence, vessel segments are only selected when at least 11 of the 21-line markers&#xD;
      have a positive signal for the presence of an erythrocyte. Thus, PBR values are independent&#xD;
      of hematocrit, reflecting a damaged glycocalyx that is more accessible for circulating&#xD;
      erythrocytes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study the evaluation of PBR takes place between 9:00 and 11:00, after 8 hours fasting&#xD;
      and abstinence from alcohol and smoking and temporary discontinuation of medications for 48 h&#xD;
      before the examination as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP We perform a follow up of our study cohort 6 years after the recruitment via&#xD;
      telephonic contact and planned appointment at the outpatient clinic. Briefly, at the&#xD;
      reevaluation the participants or their legal representatives - in case of inability or death-&#xD;
      are asked for the incidence of major cardiovascular events or death attributed to any cause.&#xD;
      The primary composite outcome of major adverse events consists of death, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (ICD-10: DI20-22), stroke (ICD-10: DI60-68; DG45) and hospitalization for heart&#xD;
      failure (ICD-10: DI50-51; DI42; DI11). Each of the forenamed events is documented by hospital&#xD;
      medical records or attending phycians' letters and confirmed by the national security&#xD;
      electronic records using the appropriate ICD10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis is performed by SPSS version 25 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Inc., Chicago, IL)&#xD;
      and Stata version 16 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Scale variables are presented as&#xD;
      mean ±SD in case of normal distribution, as determined by the normality tests&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Shapiro-Wilk, or as medians and interquartile ranges in case of&#xD;
      non-normal distribution. Nominal variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages.&#xD;
      Scale variables are compared using independent samples Student's t tests or Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      tests as indicated, whereas categorical variables are compared using Chi-square tests or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate. In addition, patients are dichotomized based on the&#xD;
      mean values of PBR for the sublingual microvessel diameter 5-25μm, 5-9 μm, 10-19 μm, and&#xD;
      20-25 μm . Cox proportional hazard models are built for each variable to decide whether any&#xD;
      of mean values of the above PBR categories can serve as an independent predictor of major&#xD;
      cardiovascular events or death at a significance level of p value&lt;0.05. Cumulative event&#xD;
      rates are calculated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for subjects with lower vs&#xD;
      higher mean PBR value. The log-rank test for time-to-event data with respect to the total&#xD;
      events is used for comparison of these two groups. Cox proportional hazard models are built&#xD;
      for each possible risk factor in relation to the study endpoints. Estimated hazard ratios and&#xD;
      their respective 95% confidence intervals are obtained. P value&lt;0.05 are considered&#xD;
      significant. Multivariate analysis include factors with proven clinical value or p value ≤0.1&#xD;
      at univariate analysis. Moreover, we compare chi-square values of multivariate models before&#xD;
      and after adjusting for PBR. Chi square change with p value&lt;0.05 is considered significant.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we calculate the net reclassification index (NRI) and Harrell's C to evaluate&#xD;
      improvement in risk prediction by PBR and p value&lt;0.05 is considered significant.&#xD;
