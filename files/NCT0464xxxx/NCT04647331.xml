    <textblock>
      Infectious endocarditis (IE) is associated with mortality rates of 10-12%. Adequate&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy is crucial for survival and is administered in high doses due to the&#xD;
      severity of the disease. In most cases, beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g. benzylpenicillin,&#xD;
      ampicillin, cloxacillin or cefotaxime) are employed. A number of patient characteristics,&#xD;
      such as age, body weight, and renal function) influence the pharmacokinetics of these drugs .&#xD;
      Yet, the interindividual variability is poorly understood meaning that a large proportion of&#xD;
      patients are at risk of subtherapeutic or excessive drug concentrations that might result in&#xD;
      treatment failure or side effects, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, data will be collected on antibiotic concentrations in patients treated&#xD;
      with beta-lactams for infectious endocarditis as well as patient characteristics and&#xD;
      treatment outcomes. A mathematical model will be developed to determine which patient factors&#xD;
      determine drug pharmacokinetics. Based on this model, predictions will be made by&#xD;
      mathematical simulations on which dosing regimens are optimal for individual patients to&#xD;
      ensure therapeutic and non-toxic drug concentrations. In total, 150 patients will be included&#xD;
      at Uppsala University Hospital. Following informed consent to participate blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected at 6 time-points during a dose interval and then at 3 time-points weekly during&#xD;
      the full treatment episode (maximum 6 weeks).&#xD;

      Objectives The primary objective of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with infectious endocarditis, and how the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile is associated with various patient factors (e.g. age, body weight, renal function).&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to descriptively assess potential associations between drug&#xD;
      exposure, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients and sample size Patients are prospectively included at the departments&#xD;
      of infectious diseases, internal and acute medicine, cardiology and thoracic surgery at&#xD;
      Uppsala University Hospital. Potential participants are screened for using the electronic&#xD;
      medical records. Inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) admission at one of the study wards,&#xD;
      (2) a diagnosis of probable or verified infectious endocarditis, (3) treatment with a&#xD;
      beta-lactam antibiotic and (4) informed written consent to participate in the study. The&#xD;
      following exclusion criteria will be applied: (1) age less than 18 years and (2) ongoing or&#xD;
      planned hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous research using similar methods, 30 patients per antibiotic substance (total&#xD;
      150 patients) is considered sufficient to develop a robust mathematical model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of blood samples and patient data Following inclusion, a series of samples will be&#xD;
      taken within one week from start of treatment. Beta-lactams are normally prescribed at 6-8 h&#xD;
      dose intervals. One series of 6 blood samples will be collected at 0, 0,5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 or 8&#xD;
      h (depending on dose interval, prior to next dose) after administration of antibiotics.&#xD;
      Thereafter, samples will be collected once weekly and 0, 3 or 4 (mid-dose interval) and 6 or&#xD;
      8 h (depending on dose interval, prior to next dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on patient characteristics, including age, body weight, and gender, will be&#xD;
      obtained from the electronic medical records. Further, the results of biomarkers (e.g.&#xD;
      albumin, creatinine, CRP), collected as part of routine practice, will be noted. If not&#xD;
      collected as standard of care, patients will be subject to extra samples to ensure biomarkers&#xD;
      are monitored at least twice weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes Treatment failure is defined as mortality during antibiotic treatment for&#xD;
      infectious endocarditis or relapse of endocarditis within 3 months after completion of&#xD;
      therapy with isolation of the same pathogens as in the initial episode. Other indicators of&#xD;
      treatment failure include acute surgery for endocarditis, clinical deterioration resulting in&#xD;
      transfer to the ICU, thromboembolic events more than 7 days after initiation of antibiotics&#xD;
      and resistance development of the causative bacteria. The following side effects will be&#xD;
      monitored: deterioration of renal impairment, allergic reaction suspected to be caused by the&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment, Clostridioides difficile enteritis or other suspected side effects&#xD;
      resulting in a shift of therapy to another antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of samples and data Blood samples will be stored at -70 degrees Celsius at the&#xD;
      Department of infectious diseases, Uppsala University Hospital. The samples will be sent to&#xD;
      Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, for determination of drug concentrations using&#xD;
      in-house developed methods for total and free (non-protein-bound) substance. The samples will&#xD;
      be stored up to 10 years after the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient names and personal identification numbers will be replaced by a number, which is&#xD;
      randomly generated in Excel. Personal data will be stored at the Department of infectious&#xD;
      diseases, Uppsala University Hospital. Only the responsible researchers will have access to&#xD;
      the code key and be able to link personal information to the individual participants. All&#xD;
      information will be handled in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&#xD;
      and all analyses and presentation of data will be performed using anonymous data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mathematical modeling and simulations The collected drug concentrations will be analyzed by&#xD;
      non-linear mixed effects modeling using NONMEM. Associations between administered dose and&#xD;
      the measured drug concentration over time will be described (pharmacokinetics). Correlations&#xD;
      with patient characteristics and biomarkers, as well as clinical outcomes in terms of cure,&#xD;
      mortality and documented side effects (pharmacodynamics) will be explored.&#xD;
