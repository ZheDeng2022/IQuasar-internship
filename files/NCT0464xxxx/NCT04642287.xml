      This clinical trial aims to investigate the efficacy of Calcipotriol ointment combined with&#xD;
      5-FU cream in Organ Transplant Recipients (OTRs) to determine if it can stimulate the immune&#xD;
      cells against actinic keratoses precancerous skin lesions after transplantation and prevent&#xD;
      cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in long-term.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this investigator-initiated clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      topical calcipotriol combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment in OTRs on&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications with precancerous skin lesions called actinic keratoses (AKs)&#xD;
      and a history of non-melanoma skin cancer in order to eliminate AKs and prevent squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (SCC) development. SCC is the most common cutaneous malignancy seen after&#xD;
      transplantation, with a 65-250fold greater incidence in organ transplant recipients (OTRs)&#xD;
      compared to the general population. This increased risk is due to the systemic&#xD;
      immunosuppression caused by anti-rejection medications, which are indispensable for&#xD;
      protecting against allograft loss. Our previous findings have established the efficacy of&#xD;
      calcipotriol in combination with 5-FU in inducing an antitumor immunity against AKs in&#xD;
      immunocompetent patients. This SCC risk reduction is accompanied by the induction of robust T&#xD;
      cell immunity and TRM cell formation against AKs. Calcipotriol is a FDA-approved low calcemic&#xD;
      vitamin D analogue for the treatment of psoriasis. Topical 5-FU is a standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      for AKs. Based on our previous findings demonstrating the synergistic impact of TSLP&#xD;
      induction by calcipotriol in combination with the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU that leads to a&#xD;
      robust T cell immunity against early skin carcinogenesis in immunocompetent patients, we aim&#xD;
      to determine whether this efficacy is maintained in OTRs on immunosuppressive therapy and its&#xD;
      effect on SCC prevention in long-term after transplantation.&#xD;
