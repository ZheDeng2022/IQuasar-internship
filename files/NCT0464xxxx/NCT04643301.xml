      To study the effect of Liraglutide (3.0 mg daily) on 9-month weight loss in low responders&#xD;
      3-months after bariatric surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: In 20 - 30% of the patients sufficient weight loss is not achieved (low&#xD;
      responders) after bariatric surgery. Secondary and/or tertiary bariatric procedures can lead&#xD;
      to successful weight loss and resolution of comorbid conditions though, morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality rates of these procedures are high. Therefore, additional pharmacotherapy has been&#xD;
      suggested. Liraglutide is one of the medications that might improve outcome in the&#xD;
      post-bariatric population. It is a Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analogue developed to&#xD;
      treat type 2 diabetes which causes glucose-dependent insulin secretion and promotes satiety&#xD;
      and inhibits glucagon secretion. In obese (non-bariatric) patients, Liraglutide has shown to&#xD;
      improve glycemic control, decrease blood pressure, lower cardiovascular risk and decrease&#xD;
      body weight. There are only a few small retrospective trials assessing the effect of&#xD;
      additional pharmacotherapy in low responders after bariatric surgery. These trials show&#xD;
      promising results, with weight loss up to 9.7 % and limited side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To study the effect of Liraglutide (3.0 mg daily) on 9-month weight loss in low&#xD;
      responders 3-months after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Pragmatic trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Bariatric patients with a pre-operative BMI ≥ 35.0 kg/m2 who have undergone&#xD;
      a primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, are treated with group&#xD;
      consultations by the Nederlandse Obesitas Kliniek and are low responders at 3-months&#xD;
      follow-up for which they will be treated with the plus module. A low responder is defined by&#xD;
      comparing the measured percentage total weight loss (%TWL) at the 3-month follow-up with the&#xD;
      expected weight loss. When %TWL is below the 25% quartile of expected weight loss the patient&#xD;
      is considered a low responder. The plus module is an extra intervention our clinic provides&#xD;
      for the patients who are considered low responders at the 3-month follow-up moment after&#xD;
      surgery, this is part of our standard care program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Addition of Liraglutide 3.0 mg daily for 6 months to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary objective is to study the effect of Liraglutide&#xD;
      (3.0 mg daily) on 9-month weight loss in low responders after bariatric surgery. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are the description of persistence of therapy and used daily dose,&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal symptoms and eating habits and weight loss up to 36 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The burden of participation consists of extra usage of medication which patients&#xD;
      have to administer subcutaneously daily, the extra consultations and two questionnaires. The&#xD;
      risks consist of the mainly gastro-intestinal side-effects.&#xD;
