  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third most common cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of disability.&#xD;
      High blood pressure is an important risk factor for stroke. Lowering a person's blood&#xD;
      pressure reduces the risk of future stroke or heart attack. However, the optimal target blood&#xD;
      pressure after a person suffers a stroke is not known. This is a study designed to establish&#xD;
      the feasibility of a larger clinical trial, the aim of which will be to find out if greater&#xD;
      blood pressure lowering is safe and effective for patients who suffer a stroke.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is the third leading cause of global death, the leading cause of acquired disability&#xD;
      and contributes substantially to dementia, cognitive decline, and healthcare costs. Global&#xD;
      epidemiological studies such as INTERSTROKE and the Global Burden of Disease study estimated&#xD;
      that hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for stroke, with a population&#xD;
      attributable risk of approximately 50%. Recurrent vascular events (stroke, coronary events,&#xD;
      vascular death) cause significant morbidity in ischaemic stroke survivors, affecting&#xD;
      approximately 30% at 5 years. Blood-pressure reduction is a proven, inexpensive strategy to&#xD;
      prevent stroke with benefits widely-generalizable in developed and developing countries. No&#xD;
      randomised trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of SBP reduction to prevent&#xD;
      secondary vascular events after ischaemic stroke to levels of about 120mmHg compared with&#xD;
      130-139mmHg. Consequently, most guidelines recommend reduction of systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      (SBP) less than 140mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to conduct an initial pilot randomised trial in Ireland and 7 leading European&#xD;
      centres involved in the European Stroke Organisation Trials Alliance. This feasibility study&#xD;
      will assess key design aspects and establish trial governance, data management, and&#xD;
      procedures in preparation for a larger definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective, open-label, blinded endpoint assessed (PROBE) randomised, parallel-group&#xD;
      pilot trial, comparing safety, efficacy, and other feasibility measures of two target SBP&#xD;
      goals (intervention 115-125 mmHg, control 130-139 mmHg).&#xD;

The final choice and dose of antihypertensive treatment(s) will be at the discretion of the treating clinicians.
