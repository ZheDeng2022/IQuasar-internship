  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to better define the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of&#xD;
      lorazepam for the analgosedation in pediatric intensive care unit. This will help to better&#xD;
      define the dosages and administration modalities (bolus or continue infusion) required to&#xD;
      achieve analgosedation with lorazepam in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prolonged use of certain sedative drugs such as midazolam, whose metabolism is associated&#xD;
      with the production of active metabolites, can lead to difficult management of sedative&#xD;
      therapy and ventilatory weaning. The active metabolites, whose production is variable,&#xD;
      determine in fact a difficulty in establishing a precision therapy, thus making it necessary&#xD;
      to identify new molecules for sedation in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Lorazepam&#xD;
      (LZ) is a benzodiazepine with an intermediate duration of activity, administered by&#xD;
      continuous infusion or intermittent bolus, which has the advantages of higher potency&#xD;
      compared to other benzodiazepines, a low cost and a metabolism that does not produce active&#xD;
      metabolites. However, the presence of propylene glycol (PG), an excipient present in&#xD;
      intravenous LZ formulations, although generally well tolerated, is potentially associated&#xD;
      with episodes of tissue toxicity due to accumulation phenomena; this may represent a risk in&#xD;
      cases where LZ is administered in high doses. This study, based on pharmacokinetic models&#xD;
      obtained from data already available in the scientific literature, aims to define the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of LZ for the analgosedation of pediatric&#xD;
      patients admitted to intensive care and subjected to mechanical ventilation. Preliminary&#xD;
      evaluation of sedative efficacy will be carried out through COMFORT-B scale assessment.&#xD;

Patients will be monitored for further 3 days of follow-up, after the end of the administration sequence. In case they would still need to undergo analgosedation, other drugs will be administered (e.g. midazolam, dexmedetomidine).&#xD;
Patients will also be divided into two age groups - 6 patients: age ≥1 year &lt;5 years (COHORT 1); 3 patients: age ≥5 years - &lt;12 years (COHORT 2)</intervention_model_description>

The COMFORT BEHAVIOURAL (COMFORT-B) SCALE consists of six items: alertness, calmness, respiratory response (for children undergoing mechanical ventilation), body movements, facial tension and muscle tone. Each item goes from 1 to 5, assessing the different intensities. The sum of the six ratings leads to a final score ranging from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 30. A patient is considered to be under-sedated in case of COMFORT-B scores of 23 or higher, over-sedated in case of COMFORT-B scores of 10 or lower.</description>
