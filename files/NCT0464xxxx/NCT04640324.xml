  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein-3 (PNPLA3), the transmembrane 6&#xD;
      superfamily member 2 protein (TM6SF2) and membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain containing&#xD;
      7 (MBOAT7) genes are involved in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development and&#xD;
      worsening. Following the actual scientific knowledge, some studies have identified the&#xD;
      genetic background surrounding NAFLD, counting up to forty different genetic variants that&#xD;
      seem to exert also a crucial role in the disease evolution, according to the natural history,&#xD;
      until hepatocellular carcinoma onset. However, few data exist regarding their influence on&#xD;
      the treatment response. The aim was to explore the effect of 303 mg of silybin-phospholipids&#xD;
      complex, 10 mg of vitamin-D and 15 mg of vitamin-E twice a day for six months in NAFLD&#xD;
      patients carrying PNPLA3-rs738409, TM6SF2-rs58542926 and MBOAT7-rs641738 genetic variants.&#xD;
      The assessed mutations are independently associated with no response to a silybin/vitamin&#xD;
      D-based therapy and could be useful therapeutic predictive markers in this context.&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to evaluate if the PNPLA3 rs738409, TM6SF2 rs58542926 and MBOAT7&#xD;
      rs641738 could influence the response of NAFLD patients regarding metabolic parameters, liver&#xD;
      damage and hepatic fat accumulation ones, to a treatment with 303 mg of silybin-phospholipids&#xD;
      complex, 10 mg of vitamin D, and 15 mg of vitamin E twice a day for six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators performed a baseline comparison of Weight, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR),&#xD;
      blood pressure measurement, body mass index (BMI), Blood glucose and insulin, the homeostatic&#xD;
      model for insulin resistance assessment (HOMA-IR), aspartate and alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
      (AST, ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), blood count, C reactive protein (CRP), the&#xD;
      Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substance (TBARS), liver stiffness and controlled attenuation&#xD;
      parameter (CAP) among the three study groups: NAFLD wild type control group (n. 30), NAFLD&#xD;
      treated wild type group (n. 30), NAFLD treated mutated group (n. 32). The block randomization&#xD;
      method was used to randomize the 60 not mutated patients in the NAFLD wild-type control group&#xD;
      and NAFLD treated wild type one, using the online randomization software&#xD;
      http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/index.cfm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wild-type control group was composed by NAFLD patients without PNPLA3, TM6SF2 and MBOAT7&#xD;
      mutations that did not receive any type of treatment during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients inserted in the NAFLD treated wild type and NAFLD treated mutated groups were&#xD;
      undergone to an oral administration of 303mg of silybin-phospholipid complex, 10mg of vitamin&#xD;
      D, and 15mg of vitamin E, twice a day for six months. None of the enrolled patients&#xD;
      dropped-out the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of treatment, the assessment of WHtR, blood pressure measurement, BMI, Blood&#xD;
      glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, AST, ALT, GGT, blood count, CRP, TBARS, liver stiffness and CAP&#xD;
      was re-performed. During the experimental observation, patients were on free diet on the&#xD;
      basis of dietary habits before the enrollment and any type of physical exercise was&#xD;
      recommended during the study period. Food intake was evaluated both at baseline and end of&#xD;
      treatment using a computerized software. The investigators recorded, with a diet diary, the&#xD;
      food intake of a complete week, including working days and the weekend. On the basis of the&#xD;
      quantities and qualities of food consumed, the soft elaborates the daily energy intake and&#xD;
      the percentage/caloric amount of macronutrients. For the physical exercise assessment, the&#xD;
      investigators submitted a specific questionnaire at baseline and end of treatment with some&#xD;
      simple questions: Are the participant doing or have the participant ever done (in the last&#xD;
      two years) sport in a continuative and regular way? Have the participant changed his/her&#xD;
      daily physical activity in the last six months? 1: no, 2: yes; if yes, has the physical&#xD;
      activity enhanced or worsened? Alcohol consumption was assessed at the beginning and at the&#xD;
      end of the treatment. One hundred two patients with histological diagnosis of NAFLD followed&#xD;
      by the Hepatogastroenterology Division of the University of Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli,&#xD;
      between January and October 2017 were screened, after signing an informed consent, for the&#xD;
      PNPLA3 rs738409, TM6SF2 rs58542926 and MBOAT7 rs641738 genetic variants and thirty-two met&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria for the study and showed at least one among PNPLA3 I148I/M, I148M/M,&#xD;
      TM6SF2 167E/K, 167K/K and MBOAT7 TMC4C/T or TMC4T/T genetic variants, were enrolled together&#xD;
      with sixty patients without the mutations. Ten patients were excluded from the enrollment due&#xD;
      to the coexistence of several comorbidities and/or advanced stages liver disease such as&#xD;
      cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of the presence/absence of NAFLD and the staging were assessed by performing a&#xD;
      liver biopsy, serological tests and collecting clinical data. Medical history, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption (AUDIT-C), medications, drug abuse, smoking habits, were also investigated. Blood&#xD;
      pressure, weight, height were directly measured and WHtR was calculated. BMI was also&#xD;
      calculated by dividing the weight (kg) by the square of height (m). The patients were&#xD;
      undergone after 12 hours fast to peripheral venous blood samples collection in order to&#xD;
      evaluate some biochemical parameters and to perform the genetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin, GGT, CRP, levels were measured enzymatically using commercially available kits, AST,&#xD;
      ALT and glucose using colorimetric assay kit (Amplite 13801/13803 and Thermo Fisher&#xD;
      Scientific EIAGLUC). HOMA-IR was also calculated using the formula: fasting insulin (μU/mL) ×&#xD;
      plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FibroScan® transient elastography (TE) was performed using the FibroScan® version 502&#xD;
      (Echosens, Paris, France) with standard probes (M and XL probes. The extra large (XL) probe&#xD;
      was used when the distance from the skin to the liver capsule, assessed by ultrasonography,&#xD;
      exceeded 2.5 cm and/or when BMI was &gt;30. FibroScan® was performed by an expert physician&#xD;
      obtaining ten acceptable measurements, defined as a successful liver stiffness (LS)&#xD;
      measurement, with the maximum number of attempts set at 20. The criteria proposed by Boursier&#xD;
      et al. were used to consider the measurement &quot;very reliable&quot; (IQR/M ≤ 0:1), &quot;reliable&quot; (0:1 &lt;&#xD;
      IQR/M ≤ 0:3 or IQR/M &gt; 0:3 with LS median &lt; 7:1 kPa), or &quot;poorly reliable&quot; (IQR/M &gt; 0:3 with&#xD;
      LS median ≥ 7:1 kPa). On the basis of CAP these scores, the investigators classified the&#xD;
      enrolled patients in S0, no steatosis (0%-10% fat; 0-237 dB/m); S1, mild steatosis (11%-33%&#xD;
      fat; 238-259 dB/m); S2, moderate steatosis (34%-66% fat; 260-292 dB/m); and S3, severe&#xD;
      steatosis (&gt;67% fat; ≥293 dB/m) in accordance with calculation of the attenuation of&#xD;
      ultrasonic signals used for TE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TBARS assay was performed using 10 μl of serum. The cromogen TBARS was quantified using a&#xD;
      spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 532nm with 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxyprophane as a standard.&#xD;
      The amount of TBARS was expressed as nmol/μg of protein. Presented data are the mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation, resulting from three independent experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genomic DNA extraction from peripheral blood samples was performed by using the&#xD;
      extraction kit PureLink Genomic DNA Kit (Invitrogen by Life Technologies, USA). The DNA&#xD;
      amount of each sample was assessed by spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Thermo Fisher Scientific)&#xD;
      using a wave length of 260 nm. The presence of sample contamination was assessed by using a&#xD;
      280 nm wave length evaluation and all the sample showed good degree of purity because of the&#xD;
      260/280 ratio was between 1.8 and 2. The DNA extracted was then stored in -20°C freezer until&#xD;
      the analysis of the polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis, using the access code to the data bank&#xD;
      TM6SF2 rs58542926 (SNP 1), MBOAT7 rs641738 (SNP2), PNPLA3 rs738409 (SNP3), was performed&#xD;
      using the DNA genotyping RealTime PCR with TaqMan (Applied Biosystem) c_89463510_10 for SNP&#xD;
      1, c_8716820_10 for SNP 2, c_7241_10 for SNP 3 probes. All the evaluations were done in three&#xD;
      phases: DNA PCR amplification, allelic identification and end point analysis with melting&#xD;
      curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase was done by using the AmpliTaq Gold® DNA polymerase contained in the TaqMan&#xD;
      Universal PCR Master Mix amplifying the target sequence by specific primers contained in the&#xD;
      SNP Genotyping Assay 40X together with TaqMan® MGB probes: one marked with fluorochrome VIC®&#xD;
      that recognize the sequence of the allele 1 and another probe marked with fluorochrome FAM™&#xD;
      that recognize the sequence of the allele 2. For each experiment a 48 well plate was used, in&#xD;
      which, a part of the biologic samples of unknown genotype for the SNP analysis, three&#xD;
      different negative controls were analyzed in order to avoid possible errors due to the&#xD;
      contamination of samples. Each experiment was done in triplicate. The amplifications were&#xD;
      performed using the StepOne™ Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The genotyping&#xD;
      assessment is based on the allelic discrimination thanks to a different fluorescence of the&#xD;
      specific gene primer, using two MGB TaqMan® probes, marked at 5' with a different&#xD;
      fluorochrome: SNP1 in reverse G in VIC® and A in FAM™; SNIP2 in forward C in VIC® and T in&#xD;
      FAM™; SNIP3 in forward C in VIC® e G in FAM™. For the results analysis the software&#xD;
      StepOne™2.0 was used. After the differentiation of the fluorescence made from the probes to&#xD;
      the background in each well, it measures the normalized signal intensities (Rn) projecting&#xD;
      the results in allelic discrimination plot. The software gives to the samples a specific&#xD;
      genotype based on the fluorescence signal position: horizontal axis (allele one), vertical&#xD;
      axis (allele 2) diagonal axis (both allele one and two). The prevalence of a specific&#xD;
      fluorescence on the other one identified the homozygosis genotype, on the contrary the&#xD;
      presence of both the heterozygosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The number of patients (30 in the NAFLD wild-type control group, 30 in&#xD;
      the NAFLD treated wild type and 32 in NAFLD treated mutated ones) was calculated using the&#xD;
      power and sample size calculation function of STATA-14® for mac-OS, on the basis of an&#xD;
      expected difference among the study groups in the response of the HOMA-IR to the therapy,&#xD;
      assuming a double amount of patient responder to the therapy in wild type group in comparison&#xD;
      to the mutated one. Specifically, the investigators considered the patients responder if at&#xD;
      least one of the following criteria was addressed: normalization of the HOMA-IR (&lt;2.5) at the&#xD;
      end of treatment starting from baseline values greater than 2.5; reduction of the HOMA-IR ≥ 2&#xD;
      points at the end of treatment in comparison to baseline. On the basis of this difference,&#xD;
      the investigators estimated 29 patients per arm as the correct sample size of subjects to be&#xD;
      investigate maintaining an 0.01 alpha error and a 90% statistical power in a two-sided test&#xD;
      with a 95% Confidence Interval. A Kolgoromov-Smirnov for normality was performed to evaluate&#xD;
      if parametric or non-parametric analysis should be applied. Wilcoxon signed ranks test,&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test and t-test for dependent or independent groups were performed in order to&#xD;
      compare continuous variables. The Kruskal-Wallis test or ANOVA test with post-hoc Bonferroni&#xD;
      analysis, in case of non-normal or normal distribution respectively, were performed to&#xD;
      compare the continuous variables among three groups. Pearson's or Kendall Tau-b correlations&#xD;
      as well as linear regression were applied to test the associations among variables. Multiple&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the genotype of&#xD;
      patients (NAFLD treated wild type vs mutated patients) and the therapeutic outcome on:&#xD;
      insulin, HOMA-IR, ALT, CRP and TBARS. The investigators identified in the following values&#xD;
      the specific cut-offs to consider the parameter improved: insulin normalization (&lt; 24&#xD;
      micro-IU/ml), normalization of the HOMA-IR (&lt;2.5) at the end of treatment starting from&#xD;
      baseline values greater than 2.5 and/or reduction of the HOMA-IR ≥ 2 points at the end of&#xD;
      treatment in comparison to baseline, ALT normalization (&lt;45 IU/L), CRP normalization (&lt;0.6&#xD;
      mg/dL) or reduction of at least 1 mg/dL, TBARS reduction of at least 10 nmol/μg. The&#xD;
      abovementioned parameters were chosen in relation to the main therapeutic effect of silybin&#xD;
      in this context, considering NAFLD as a systemic disease. The relative risk (RR) of a useful&#xD;
      therapeutic outcome considering the genotype of the patients was calculated considering the&#xD;
      confounding variables (age, sex, comorbidities, medications, liver stiffness and CAP).&#xD;
      Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05 in a two-tailed test with a 95% Confidence&#xD;
      Interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS®)&#xD;
      vs.18.0.&#xD;
