    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to generate real-world evidence to describe the patient experience of&#xD;
      administration of Somatuline® Autogel® (lanreotide) in homecare and hospital settings, and&#xD;
      the associated impact on healthcare utilisation, societal cost, work productivity and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL)&#xD;
