      This phase Ib trial evaluates the side effects and best dose of choline salicylate given&#xD;
      together with a low dose of selinexor in treating patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma&#xD;
      or mantle cell lymphoma that has cancer cells remaining after attempts to remove the cancer&#xD;
      have been made (residual), has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as choline salicylate lower the body's immune&#xD;
      response and are used with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer. Selinexor&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking a protein called CRM1 that is needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. help doctors learn more about selinexor and choline salicylate as a treatment for&#xD;
      lymphoma. This trial may help doctors learn more about selinexor and choline salicylate as a&#xD;
      treatment for lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of choline salicylate (CS) that can be&#xD;
      combined with selinexor twice weekly in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B&#xD;
      cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the response (overall response rate [ORR], clinical benefit rate [CBR] and&#xD;
      duration of response [DOR]) of selinexor and CS in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL or&#xD;
      MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if CRM1 expression in malignant lymphoma cells from patients treated on this&#xD;
      study have a predictive role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive selinexor orally (PO) twice a week (BIW) on days 1, 3, 8, 10, 15, 17, 22,&#xD;
      and 24, and choline salicylate PO three times daily (TID) on days 1-28. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic analysis receive choline salicylate beginning on day 3 of cycle 1 (D3C1) and&#xD;
      beginning on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patents who achieve &gt;= stable&#xD;
      disease continue treatment for an additional 6 cycles (maximum of 12 cycles) at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician and patient.&#xD;
