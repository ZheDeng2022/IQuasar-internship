  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burns can lead to lesions of total thickness, which extend the reticular layer of the dermis&#xD;
      requiring a healing process, resulting in aesthetic problems, hypertrophic and functional&#xD;
      scars that causes the patient a state of low esteem and social isolation. Elastic bandage -&#xD;
      Kinesio tape - is a low cost therapeutic resource when compared to the compression mesh and&#xD;
      silicone gel plates, commonly indicated for the conservative treatment of these scars. The&#xD;
      compressive effect of the bandage on the hypertrophic scar tissue promotes the reduction of&#xD;
      local vascularization and the realignment of the collagen fibers, resulting in the repair of&#xD;
      the multidirectional mobility of the treated tissue. The aim of the study is to determine the&#xD;
      effect of elastic bandage with tension on the inflammatory response of hypertrophic scars in&#xD;
      patients with deep burns. It is a randomized, triple blind study. Patients aged 18-59 years&#xD;
      with hypertrophic scars due to burns will be included, and those with scaling and open wounds&#xD;
      in scar tissue will be included, pregnant women and patients who have previously used any&#xD;
      therapeutic resource that may have altered the remodeling process of the hypertrophic scar.&#xD;
      The bandage will be applied on the scar selected by lottery. The intervention group will&#xD;
      receive the bandage with a tension around 70% and the group will control the same bandage&#xD;
      without tension. This feature will be used for a period of three to four days. Initial and&#xD;
      subsequent evaluations will be performed after 45 and 90 days. Primary outcome: analysis of&#xD;
      the inflammatory response. Through immunohistochemistry and the histological evaluation of&#xD;
      the organization pattern of collagen fibers. Secondary: aesthetic and functional evaluation&#xD;
      of the hypertrophic scar through the Vancouver scale. The statistical analysis will be done&#xD;
      by the researcher and his collaborators, in addition to the statistical one, using the&#xD;
      statistical programs Epi-Info 3.5 and Medcalc. For categorical variables, where appropriate,&#xD;
      use of the chi-square test of association and Fisher's exact test. Regarding the quantitative&#xD;
      variables, the unpaired samples were Student's t-test and if the distribution is not normal,&#xD;
      the Mann-Whitney test will be used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Burns can lead to lesions of total thickness, which extend the reticular layer of the dermis&#xD;
      requiring a repair process 1-2. This healing process, generally due to external and internal&#xD;
      stimuli, causes scarring changes, among them, the hypertrophic scar 3-4. They develop about&#xD;
      two months after the burn, occur more frequently in areas of high tension, preferably in the&#xD;
      extensor faces of the joints or when they cross perpendicularly the lines of force of the&#xD;
      skin. They exhibit scar tissue growth above the surface of the skin, respecting the limits of&#xD;
      the original wound and are characterized by their reddish color, high stature, decreased&#xD;
      flexibility and altered sensitivity 5-10. Patients with this type of scar can present&#xD;
      stiffness in scar tissue, disfigurement, joint contractures, reduced range of motion,&#xD;
      difficulties in daily functions and even psychological problems 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical strengths, when applied externally, can decrease the thickness of the epidermis,&#xD;
      reduce the inflammatory response and promote a reorganization of the collagen fibers&#xD;
      contained in the dermis, and thus improve the appearance of the vascularization and&#xD;
      flexibility of the hypertrophic scar. Based on this principle, one of the therapeutic&#xD;
      resources that can exert this external compressive effect is the elastic bandage - kinesio&#xD;
      tape 12-13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of elastic bandage - kinesio-taping is based on the principles of kinesiology and the&#xD;
      self-healing ability of the organism. It takes advantage of the physical and mechanical&#xD;
      properties of the bandage and the therapeutic action by the specific method of its&#xD;
      application. Improving the appearance and perception of the scar, reducing functional&#xD;
      limitations, thus repairing the patient's self-esteem 14-15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the few publications on the mechanism of action of elastic bandage, and its benefits,&#xD;
      in the treatment of cicatricial sequelae due to burn. There was interest in seeking evidence&#xD;
      that could support the mechanism of action of this therapeutic resource, and thus, a&#xD;
      randomized, triple blind, controlled sham clinical trial was developed. It will be held at&#xD;
      the Rehabilitation Center of the Governador Paulo Guerra Restoration Hospital (HR) located in&#xD;
      Brazil and reference in the care of the burned patient. The study period will be from March&#xD;
      2018 to March 2020, with collection expected for June 2019 to November 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is the patients with hypertrophic scarring in the rehabilitation clinic&#xD;
      of the HR. Patients will be picked up at the reception of this service, and they will be&#xD;
      referred to the researcher responsible for the project. Once identified, the checklist of&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and if eligible, patients will be invited by the researcher to&#xD;
      participate in the study. In case of acceptance, the Informed Consent Form will be read aloud&#xD;
      and if they agree to participate, they will sign it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those selected will be referred for initial clinical evaluation and other protocols that&#xD;
      involve the study, among them, the selection of the scar, which will obey the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and define the lesion treated with kinesio tape. In sequence, participants will be&#xD;
      allocated randomly and stealthily through a computerized algorithm according to a table of&#xD;
      sequential numbers from 1 to 30 using software R version 2.5.1. Generating the list of random&#xD;
      allocation order, patients will use the letters A and B not knowing their meaning, being&#xD;
      established only as treated with tension or without tension. Randomization is simple in two&#xD;
      groups, the experimental or intervention group that will receive the kinesio tape with&#xD;
      tension between seventy to ninety percent and the sham group with zero tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be referred for evaluation of the functional and aesthetic aspect of the&#xD;
      hypertrophic scar, using as instrument of the Vancouver scale. In sequence will be taken to&#xD;
      collect the scar material studied, through a biopsy performed at the Center for Treatment of&#xD;
      Burns HR. After data collection, evaluation and biopsy, the treatment of patients is started.&#xD;
      The therapeutic proposal will follow the routine of the service and the therapeutic protocol&#xD;
      of the study common to all patients with cicatricial sequelae consisting of lubrication and&#xD;
      massage of the scar and performing active free exercises and stretching for the limbs&#xD;
      involved in the injury. It follows with the application of kinesio tape in the patients&#xD;
      involved in the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
