    <textblock>
      Single center, single arm pilot trial to test the feasibility, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      NeoTIL-ACT combined with low-dose irradiation (LDI) in patients with advanced, recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is based on lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by LDI, and then ACT utilizing ex&#xD;
      vivo expanded TIL, enriched for tumor antigen specificity (NeoTIL), in combination with high&#xD;
      dose Interleukin-2 (IL-2) (optional, depending on patient's tolerance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LDI will be administered once to metastatic lesions using tomotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to define the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of NeoTIL-ACT&#xD;
      in combination with LDI in patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic solid tumors, as&#xD;
      categorized in two molecularly defined cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will begin with intravenous (IV) non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy composed by fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Both treatments will be started on&#xD;
      the same day. Fludarabine will be administered from for five days, and cyclophosphamide ffor&#xD;
      two days. Low-dose irradiation (LDI) will be administered once, to tumor lesions using&#xD;
      tomotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive NeoTIL infusion intravenously followed by high dose IL-2 administration&#xD;
      every eight hours, for a maximum of eight doses. Supportive care will be given as needed&#xD;
      during the whole treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients achieving a stable disease, partial response or complete response after NeoTIL-ACT&#xD;
      treatment will then enter a clinical follow-up period for 5 years.&#xD;
