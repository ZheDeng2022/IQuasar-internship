  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It,s a retrospective case-control pilot study is to be carried out. Twenty patients will be&#xD;
      included in the study for each branch (a total of 60). The study population will be patients&#xD;
      whose partners have a diagnosis of an altered vaginal microbiome with (Cases, n = 20) or&#xD;
      without (Controls, n = 20) persistence to drug treatment. Since a normal reference seminal&#xD;
      microbiome has not been described, we will include a control group that will consist of sperm&#xD;
      donors (n = 20) who are considered fertile potential without reproductive problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the project is to identify the interaction of the vaginal and seminal&#xD;
      microbiome patterns in couples in which the vaginal pattern is altered and is persistent to&#xD;
      drug treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The semen donors included in the present work will be men between 18 and 35 years old who are included in the donation program of Instituto Bernabeu after having passed a series of physical, psychological, analytical, genetic and serological evaluations and are considered suitable for donation as established by Royal Decree-Law 9/2014. Likewise, donors are subjected to a series of seminal quality evaluations and seminal freeze-thaw tests in order to guarantee their fertile potential. In this way, the donors who are part of the Instituto Bernabeu donation program also comply with current legal regulations with a strict evaluation to be considered the gold standard of potentially fertile semen. In addition, it will be necessary for them to provide a signed informed consent accepting their participation in the study.</description>
