  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of microwave ablation&#xD;
      catheter in the treatment of varicose veins in lower extremities,meanwhile, to compare the&#xD;
      quality of subjects'lives before and after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The chronic venous insufficiency of lower extremities (chronic venous insufficiency, CVI) is&#xD;
      a set of a series of clinical syndrome caused by venous reflux, common symptoms are&#xD;
      heaviness, fatigue, swelling, burning sentation, itching, pain, etc.The main causes of&#xD;
      superficial varicose veins are weakness of superficial vein wall, insufficiency or defect of&#xD;
      vein valve closure and increased pressure inside veins.The weakness of venous wall, the&#xD;
      decreasing of flexibility, venous valve defects the the poor structure, be related with&#xD;
      genetic factor, belong to &quot;primary&quot; inferior venous valves' incomplete closure.The&#xD;
      influencing factors of primary valve insufficiency include heavy physical labor, long&#xD;
      standing or sitting work, obesity, pregnancy, chronic constipation, and chronic&#xD;
      cough.Varicose veins secondary to a history of venous thrombosis of the lower extremities,&#xD;
      venous system obstruction and increased venous pressure caused by circulating blood volume&#xD;
      exceeding reflux load are secondary.When the valve of the great saphenous vein at the&#xD;
      junction of the saphenous vein is damaged and closed incompletely, the valve function of the&#xD;
      distal and perforating vein can be affected step by step, and the small saphenous vein can&#xD;
      also be affected through its branch vein.Because the superficial vein wall's muscle layer is&#xD;
      thin and their surrounding lackness of connective tissue, blood regurgitation can cause the&#xD;
      venous lumen to thicken, tortuosity and lengthen, presenting as superficial varicose&#xD;
      veins.Because of the severe venous pressure of lower extremity,the vascular permeability of&#xD;
      football boots is increasing,resulting the appearance of a large number of blood capillary&#xD;
      hyperplasia.Due to a large number of fibrinogen hindered the exchange between capillary and&#xD;
      the surrounding tissue, the nutritional change of subcutaneous tissue occured,including skin&#xD;
      pigmentation, eczema, dermatitis, subcutaneous lipid sclerosis and ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional treatments of lower extremity varicose veins,including high ligation and&#xD;
      stripping of great saphenous vein,varicose vein's resection and ligation of perforating&#xD;
      vein,can cause large trauma,huge pain,limitation of activity and long convalescence and&#xD;
      aesthetic problems,etc.As a consequence,a variety of minimally invasive method with small&#xD;
      wound,little pain and early recovery are prevalently applied in clinical, also achieved&#xD;
      plenty of good therapeutic effect.According to the different mechanism of minimally invasive&#xD;
      treatment, it can be divided into two categories: physical injury (laser closure,&#xD;
      radiofrequency closure, microwave treatment, electrocoagulation, transparent direct rotation,&#xD;
      laparoscopic great saphenous vein resection, etc.) and chemical injury (sclerosing agent&#xD;
      injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical observation in our department found that the pain, bruising, numbness, and number of&#xD;
      incisions after microwave ablation were all lower than those of traditional high position&#xD;
      ligation and extraction with laser closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to report a monocentricity, prospective Chinese experience using&#xD;
      the ECO Varicose Veins Therapeutic Unit from ECO (Nanjing ECO Microwave System Co.Ltd) for&#xD;
      Endovenous Microwave Ablation (EMA) to treat primary great and short saphenous vein reflux&#xD;
      and to evaluate its safety, efficacy and life quality.&#xD;
