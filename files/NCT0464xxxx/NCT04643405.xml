    <textblock>
      This study is a two stage study consisting of a dose escalation phase Ib and a phase II study&#xD;
      which include subjects with previously-treated, advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Dose&#xD;
      Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of APG1387 in combination with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be evaluated in the dose escalation phase Ib. Safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of APG1387 plus gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel will be evaluated in phase II.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The ability of tumor cells to evade apoptosis is currently a major problem in anti-tumor&#xD;
      therapy. IAPs are an important class of apoptosis-regulating proteins. APG-1387, a potent&#xD;
      bivalent SMAC mimetic, small molecule of IAP inhibitor, which could inhibit pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      proliferation as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy through apoptosis pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's an open label, multiple centers phase Ib/II Study. Safety and tolerability of APG1387&#xD;
      combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be evaluated in phase Ib in&#xD;
      previously-treated, advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. Efficacy and tolerability&#xD;
      will be evaluated in phase II study in first line standard treatment failed metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients.&#xD;
