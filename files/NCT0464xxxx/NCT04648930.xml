  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label, special drug use study to investigate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Xolair by collecting data in its clinical setting in patients with&#xD;
      severe to most severe seasonal allergic rhinitis aged ≥ 12 years and &lt; 18 years whose&#xD;
      symptoms were inadequately controlled despite to conventional therapies and used Xolair.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The observation period will last for up to 24 weeks, with Day 1 defined as the start date of&#xD;
      Xolair treatment. It should be noted that, because the duration of Xolair treatment depends&#xD;
      on the pollen dispersal situation and other factors, patients who complete or discontinue&#xD;
      Xolair treatment before the visit at 24 weeks after the start of treatment will be followed&#xD;
      up until the date of last dose of Xolair + 30 days, and the results will be recorded in the&#xD;
      CRF.&#xD;
