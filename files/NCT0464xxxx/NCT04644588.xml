      Purpose: To determine the effect of scapular alignment on upper limb function in hemiparetic&#xD;
      children and to find relation between scapular alignment of the affected, less affected limb&#xD;
      and the upper limb function in children with spastic hemiparesis Subjects: Forty children&#xD;
      with spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsy, from both genders, were included in this study. They&#xD;
      were selected from Outpatient Clinic of Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University. The&#xD;
      age of the selected children was ranging from 3 to 6 years old. Degree of spasticity is&#xD;
      ranging from 1 to 1+ according to modified Ashworth scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Forty children with spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsy were assessed for scapular&#xD;
      alignment using Postural zone software and for upper limb function using pediatric arm&#xD;
      function test.&#xD;

      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty children with spastic hemiplegic CP, from both genders, were included in this study.&#xD;
      They were selected from Outpatient Clinic of Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Both genders were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. They were able to follow instructions and understand commands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Degree of spasticity is ranging from 1 to 1+ according to modified Ashworth scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Postural zone software was assess scapular alignment and pediatric arm function test was&#xD;
           assess upper arm function .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child was excluded from the study if he / she has one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Upper limb surgery in the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children which had contracture, fracture, and fixed deformities in the upper limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Children with muscleoskletal abnormalities as fixed back deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty children with spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsy were assessed for scapular alignment&#xD;
      using Postural zone software and for upper limb function using pediatric arm function test.&#xD;
