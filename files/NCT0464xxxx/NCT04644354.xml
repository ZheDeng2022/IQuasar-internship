  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm labor is one of the problems of obstetrics, and is one of the leading cause of&#xD;
      neonatal morbidity and mortality. The incidence of preterm birth is around 7 to 9 %. The&#xD;
      preterm baby is prone to respiratory, renal, neurologic and gastrointestinal problems. The&#xD;
      correct diagnosis should be followed by the early administration of the most effective&#xD;
      tocolytic agent with least side effects for both mother and fetus. Nifedipine, a calcium&#xD;
      channel blocker, has gained a world-wide popularity recently since it has the least&#xD;
      side-effects on both mother and fetus. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the success&#xD;
      rate of tocolytic agent 'nifedipine' on the spontaneous preterm labor of singeton pregnant&#xD;
      women with intact amnionic membrane.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is the main reason of perinatal morbidity and mortality. The main management&#xD;
      method of this important problem is to prolong the pregnancy period and to use&#xD;
      corticosteroids to prevent fetal pulmonary distress. The most widely studied tocolytic&#xD;
      agents, ritodrin, salbutamol and terbutaline are all betamimetics, and they are shown to&#xD;
      prolong birth labor till 7 days and do not have any effct on the fetal mortality. However,&#xD;
      their maternal side-effects are inevitable and can be mortal. They cause tachycardia,&#xD;
      hypotension and some biochemical disturbances. Furthermore, maternal death is possible due to&#xD;
      pulmonary edema. These adrenergic agonists are the first line tocolytics, but calcium canal&#xD;
      blockers are becoming more popular since they have less side effects and comparable efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium canal blockers are nonspecific smooth muscle relaxants used in adult hypertension&#xD;
      treatment. Their tocolytic effect depends on their inhibition of calcium ions into the&#xD;
      myometrial cells. In vitro studies have shown that they have strong relaxant effects on human&#xD;
      myometrium. In the present study, our aim is to investigate the effects of nifedipine in our&#xD;
      clinic in a period between 2002 and 2005, when it was first used in our clinic as the sÄ±ngle&#xD;
      tocolytic agent. Its success in preventing preterm labor and its complications in our earlier&#xD;
      practice will be noted and this retrospective study will guide us in its current usage,&#xD;
      dosages and side-effects.&#xD;
