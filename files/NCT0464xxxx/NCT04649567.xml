  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer (CC) survivors have an increased risk of developing T2D. A recent study revealed&#xD;
      that the surgical procedures per se may be causally involved. Hence, left-sided colon&#xD;
      resections increased the risk of developing T2D. In addition, treatment with chemotherapy may&#xD;
      play a role in the pathogenesis. Given the steadily improving survival rate after a CC&#xD;
      diagnosis, prevention of secondary diseases such as T2D is important to improve quality of&#xD;
      life in these patients and to reduce socioeconomic expenses. This study aims to elucidate the&#xD;
      effect of resection of tumors located in the left part of the colon on pathophysiological&#xD;
      intermediates, which may lead to T2D 12 months post-surgery or later. The physiological&#xD;
      mechanism might be a changed postprandial secretion of gut hormones including glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1 (GLP-1) secreted from L-cells in the left part of the colon. The investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate changes in primarily glucose homeostasis as well as in gastrointestinal hormones,&#xD;
      microbiota, visceral fat accumulation and markers of low-grade inflammation etc. in CC&#xD;
      survivors who underwent a left hemicolectomy or sigmoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: 60 patients will be included in this explorative clinical study.&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into 4 groups depending on surgical procedure and treatment with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In the group of patients undergoing left hemicolectomy or sigmoidectomy ±&#xD;
      treatment with chemotherapy 2 x 15 patients will be included, and in the group of patients&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo right hemicolectomy ± treatment with chemotherapy another 2 x 15&#xD;
      patients will be included. During the 3 study visits (before surgery, 3-4 weeks post-surgery&#xD;
      and 12 months post-surgery) the following tests will be performed: An oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test, blood and fecal sampling, a DXA scan and an ad libitum meal test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: With this study the investigators expect to obtain an insight in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis behind the possible development of T2D in CC survivors who underwent a resection&#xD;
      of the left part of the colon ± treatment with chemotherapy. This insight may also help&#xD;
      scientists develop new ways of treating or preventing T2D in general.&#xD;
