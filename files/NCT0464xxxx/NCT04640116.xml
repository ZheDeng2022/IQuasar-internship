  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) could effectively decrease portal&#xD;
      hypertension-related complications. This study intends to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      TIPS combined with subsequent microwave ablation in HCC patients with refractory ascites.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with refractory ascites (RA) have a very poor&#xD;
      prognosis, and there are no effective treatments recommended by the guidelines. TIPS could&#xD;
      downgrade the ascites and improve Child-Pugh scores. TIPS has been a common management model&#xD;
      for RA for end-stage liver disease. There is no prospective study evaluating TIPS plus&#xD;
      thermal ablation. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective, single-arm study to&#xD;
      find out it.&#xD;

    <description>A needle punctured the portal vein through the transjugular approach. After a successful puncture, the parenchymal tract was dilated, and covered stents (GORE® VIATORR) were introduced. The specifications of the covered stents were 8 mm × 50 mm, 8 mm × 60 mm, 8 mm × 70 mm, and 8 mm × 80 mm. All of the diameters of the bare stents were 8 mm, and the lengths were 50-80 mm. The portal vein pressure was measured before and after shunt creation. After the insertion of TIPS, all of the patients received a diuretic treatment and a salt-limited diet until the ascites disappeared.</description>

    <intervention_name>microwave ablation (MWA)</intervention_name>
    <description>MWA: After the patient's ascites disappears, MWA therapy will be performed. A MWA antenna was gradually inserted into the tumor along the predetermined angle under the guidance of Computed Tomography (CT). The whole thermal procedure was conducted under intravenous anesthesia. Vital signs were monitored during the procedure. The settings of the ablation parameters depended upon the manufacturer's recommendation and our experience. Ablation volume was determined by physicians according to liver function, tumor invasion site, and tumor stage. An upper abdominal CT scan was carried out immediately after the procedure to evaluate the ablation area and complications.</description>
