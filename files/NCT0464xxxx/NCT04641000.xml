  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational clinical cohort study involving children born very&#xD;
      preterm at less than 31 weeks and six days gestation. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the microbiome (the collection of microbes in a biological site) alternations&#xD;
      resulting from preterm birth and associations with the risk of immune dysregulation, asthma&#xD;
      and allergies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One important factor in gut health is the large community of microbes (tiny living things&#xD;
      such as bacteria) that live on the human body called the microbiome. Recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that premature babies are more likely to have changes in their gut microbiome that are&#xD;
      associated with health issues. However, the specific microbiome features that are involved in&#xD;
      the development of premature babies is still unknown. Therefore, this study examines the&#xD;
      impact of very premature birth on the baby's microbiome, and how microbiome alterations are&#xD;
      involved in health issues such as immune dysregulation, allergies and asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The large communities of microbes in the gut play a major role on the microbiome that will&#xD;
      form during infancy and childhood. Factors such as diet, exposure to antibiotics, surgical&#xD;
      procedures, and mode of delivery, can strongly affect the dynamics microbiome development. It&#xD;
      is well known that microbiome alterations are associated with disorders such as asthma.&#xD;
      However, the features involved in disease development and progression are highly&#xD;
      understudied. Through this clinical study, we will evaluate associations between the early&#xD;
      patterns of microbial colonization in premature infants and their risk to develop asthma&#xD;
      later in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that microbial alterations resulting from preterm birth&#xD;
      causally contribute to the allergy and asthma risk in infants (defined by atopic-wheeze)&#xD;
      through immune mechanisms.&#xD;
