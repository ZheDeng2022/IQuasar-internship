      Introduction-Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA) is&#xD;
      gradually increasing recently. However, it is not clear whether TOETVA is a true minimally&#xD;
      invasive thyroidectomy compared to open conventional thyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aimed to evaluate the TOETVA and open conventional thyroidectomy techniques&#xD;
      in terms of postoperative inflammatory response, pain and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, 40 female patients between the ages of 18-65 were divided into 2&#xD;
      groups of 20 patients: TOETVA: 20 patients, open thyroidectomy: 20 patients. Operation time,&#xD;
      inflammatory response with IL-6, white blood cell (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
      postoperative pain, postoperative complications and patient satisfaction were evaluated in&#xD;
      both groups.&#xD;

      The application of transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA) is&#xD;
      gradually increasing recently. However, it is not clear whether TOETVA is a true minimally&#xD;
      invasive thyroidectomy compared to open conventional thyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aimed to evaluate the TOETVA and open conventional thyroidectomy techniques&#xD;
      in terms of postoperative inflammatory response, pain and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This non-randomized prospective clinical study was performed in our clinic between September&#xD;
      2019 and January 2020 with the approval of the Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research&#xD;
      Hospital Ethics Committee (Ethics committee date: 19/03/2019, number: 2313).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, it was planned to form 2 groups with 20 patients in each, performing&#xD;
      conventional open thyroidectomy (OTG) (Group 1) or transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy&#xD;
      vestibular approach (TOETVA) (TTG) (Group 2). All patients who agreed to participate in the&#xD;
      study were informed about both surgical techniques and complications, and their written&#xD;
      consent was obtained. Patients took part in Group 1 or Group 2 according to their own&#xD;
      preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, 43 patients underwent thyroidectomy. Patients who did not comply with the&#xD;
      study criteria were excluded from the study. 43 female patients were selected from these&#xD;
      patients who were eligible for the study. Of these patients, 3 patients who were converted to&#xD;
      open surgery in the TTG group were excluded from the study, and a total of 40 patients were&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeries were performed by an experienced endocrine surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional thyroidectomy: After neck extension with a thyroid pillow and patient&#xD;
      positioning, thyroidectomy and/or central neck dissection was performed using a 4 to 6cm&#xD;
      collar transverse incision. Subplatysmal flap dissection was applied up to the sternal notch&#xD;
      inferiorly and to the thyroid cartilage superiorly, and through the mid line of the strap&#xD;
      muscles, the thyroid gland was reached. After receiving a vagus nerve impulse, upper pole&#xD;
      dissection was performed under the guidance of IONM. Identification and monitoring of&#xD;
      recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs) and external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves&#xD;
      (EBSLNs) were carried out systematically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOETVA: All patients received preoperative chlorhexidine mouthwash and preoperative&#xD;
      intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was administered for prophylaxis. Orotracheal&#xD;
      intubation was performed. A slight extension posture was given to the neck with a pillow&#xD;
      placed under the shoulder, and the patients were placed in 15 degrees of Trendelenburg&#xD;
      position. Skin and oral cavity were wiped with povidone iodine. A central 1.5-2 cm transverse&#xD;
      incision was performed in the middle of the distance between the first vermillion inner edge&#xD;
      and the inferior labial frenulum in the oral vestibule. Through the peripheral fibers of the&#xD;
      submucosa and orbicularis oris muscle, the jaw tip was reached with a monopolar&#xD;
      electrocautery between the two mentalis muscles deep in the subdermal layer. From this&#xD;
      incision, 50 cc of 1/500000 adrenaline-saline solution was applied to the anterior neck with&#xD;
      a Veress needle. A surgical field was created from this incision by dissection of thyroid&#xD;
      cartilage with Kelly forceps. The surgical field was formed by blunt dissection from the&#xD;
      incision in the subplatysmal area, up to both sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCMs) leading edge&#xD;
      and to the sternal notch in the inferiorly with the blunt type tunnel probe. For the 30°&#xD;
      camera from the central incision, 10 mm blunt tipped port was entered and operation was&#xD;
      performed under 6 mmHg CO 2 pressure and 15 L/min CO 2 flow rate. In addition, with 3-4 silk&#xD;
      sutures placed on the front neck, the skin is mechanically hung and an optimal working area&#xD;
      is provided. A vertical 5 mm incision was made from the lateral side of the canine tooth and&#xD;
      edge of vermillion at both sides, and two working channels were created parallel to the 10 mm&#xD;
      port. Subplatysmal workspace was opened completely with Hook cautery and Harmonic scalpel.&#xD;
      Strap muscles were opened in midline, and dissected over thyroid gland. The strap muscles&#xD;
      were retracted by a transcutaneous 2/0 silk suture. Thyroid isthmus is divided. The upper&#xD;
      pole was dissected, controlled with the EBSLN monitoring probe, and the thyroid vessels were&#xD;
      separated from the thyroid capsule with Ultracision. The superior parathyroids are identified&#xD;
      and dissected and protected. The recurrent laryngeal nerve was viewed at the entrance of the&#xD;
      larynx and introduced towards proximally. The Berry region was separated close to the thyroid&#xD;
      capsule to protect RLN. Inferior parathyroids have been identified and protected. The thyroid&#xD;
      gland was separated from the trachea. The thyroid gland was placed in the endobag placed&#xD;
      through the 10 mm port and extracted. The same surgical procedures were applied to the&#xD;
      opposite lobe in total thyroidectomy. Following bleeding control, RLN (R2) and vagus (V2)&#xD;
      signals were measured with IONM probe and recorded. Surgicel was placed into the surgical&#xD;
      field. The midline was closed with 3/0 polyglactin sutures. No drain was used in any patient.&#xD;
      Intraoral incisions were sutured with 4/0 polyglactin. 24-hour pressure dressing was applied&#xD;
      to the chin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The upper pole vessels were separated on the thyroid capsule with bipolar cautery. In lateral&#xD;
      dissection of the thyroid lobe, RLN was identified in the region where it crosses with the&#xD;
      inferior thyroid artery (ITA). Then, RLN was fully dissected up to its entry through the&#xD;
      larynx under the cricopharyngeal muscle (CP muscle). Preserving parathyroids, ITA branches&#xD;
      were separated from the capsule. R2 and V2 signals were measured after bleeding control.&#xD;
      Surgicel® was placed in the surgical field and strap muscles were reapproximated with 3/0&#xD;
      polyglactin. The subcutaneous tissue was sutured separately with polyglactin. The skin was&#xD;
      reapproximated subcutaneously with polyglactin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory Response: Preoperative, postoperative 2nd hour, 1st day and 2nd day CRP&#xD;
      (C-reactive protein), WBC (White blood cell), IL-6 (Interleukin 6) levels were measured to&#xD;
      evaluate the inflammatory response in all patients. To measure IL-6, blood samples were&#xD;
      collected from patients, centrifuged, then stored at -80oC. After all the serum were&#xD;
      collected, they were evaluated using the Human IL-6 ELISA kit. To evaluate postoperative&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism, postoperative first day calcium, phosphorus and parathormone values were&#xD;
      checked. Hypocalcemic patients were controlled weekly and evaluated clinically and with&#xD;
      laboratory values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain and analgesia: As a standard in terms of pain palliation, all patients&#xD;
      received 4*1 500 mg paracetamol intravenously and 3*1 100 mg tramadol HCl on the first day;&#xD;
      3*1 500 mg paracetamol intravenously on the second day in the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain intensity of the patients was evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score (0 to&#xD;
      10) on the 2nd and 12th hour, 1st and 2nd days postoperatively. Lower lip, lower chin and&#xD;
      anterior neck area pain were evaluated separately with VAS score. VAS scores were determined&#xD;
      by patients by marking the intensity of pain on the ruler, which was marked as 0 for the&#xD;
      absence of pain and as 10 for the most severe pain sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction was evaluated on postoperative 15th and 30th days in both groups.&#xD;
      Patients were asked to evaluate and score the operation in general and in terms of cosmesis&#xD;
      (1: bad and 4: very good). In addition, the patients were asked which surgery (TOETVA or&#xD;
      conventional thyroidectomy) they would prefer if they would have the operation again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vocal cord examination with fiberoptic laryngoscopy was performed to all patients in the&#xD;
      preoperative period and within the first 2 days postoperatively by an independent&#xD;
      otorhinolaryngologist. Control examinations were planned for patients with vocal cord&#xD;
      paralysis at the 15th day, 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative and postoperative complications of patients were recorded.&#xD;
