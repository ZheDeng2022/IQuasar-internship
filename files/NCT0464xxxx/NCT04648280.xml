  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the SHIELD study, the study sponsor seeks to assess safety, PK and antiviral activity for&#xD;
      children and adolescents with dual or triple class resistance. It will also assess the&#xD;
      acceptability and swallowability of formulation among the pediatric population. The dose&#xD;
      selection of FTR for children and adolescents ≥20kg utilized a population pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (POP PK) model-based approach to achieve similar adult TMR exposures following FTR 600mg BID&#xD;
      administration with combination therapy that was demonstrated to be safe and effective in the&#xD;
      FTR Phase 3 BRIGHTE study in HTE patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female HIV-1 infected paediatric participants from 6 years old and weighing&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Antiretroviral-experienced with documented historical or baseline resistance to one or&#xD;
             more agents in at least two classes. All resistance has to be properly documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failing current antiretroviral regimen with a confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 c/mL&#xD;
             (first value from Investigator within 6 months of screening visit, with the second&#xD;
             value obtained from Screening labs, without a decline greater than 1 log10, and no&#xD;
             value &lt;1000 in between).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented resistance to at least one component of the current failing regimen per&#xD;
             screening resistance testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have at least 1 fully active and available agent in 2 or more ARV classes, based&#xD;
             on current and/or documented historical resistance testing, taking into account&#xD;
