      This study was undertaken to examine the effect of Q angle, lateral distal tibial angle&#xD;
      (LDTA), and lower extremity isometric muscle torque on ankle sprain. Among 40 participants&#xD;
      with ankle sprain, Q angle and LDTA measurements in both extremities were performed using&#xD;
      X-ray images, while the muscle strength in gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and quadriceps&#xD;
      femoris were determined with hand held dynamometer, and the muscle torque was estimated by&#xD;
      multiplying these values with the distance to the joint center. The obtained data were&#xD;
      analyzed by separation analysis. No significant relationship was found between the Q angle&#xD;
      and ankle sprain (p&gt; 0.05). A strong positive correlation was found between LDTA and ankle&#xD;
      sprain (p = 0.01). A strong negative correlation was found between quadriceps femoris muscle&#xD;
      strength, gluteus medius muscle strength and gluteus maximus muscle strength with ankle&#xD;
      sprain (p &lt;0.001, p = 0.001, p &lt;0.001, respectively). A strong negative relationship was&#xD;
      found between quadriceps, gluteus medius and gluteus maximus muscle torques with ankle sprain&#xD;
      (p &lt;0.001, p = 0.011, p = 0.002, respectively). As suggested by the discrimination analysis,&#xD;
      independent variables that contributed most to ankle injury included the gluteus maximus&#xD;
      muscle torque (MAXIMUSTORQ) (.906), gluteus medius muscle torque (MEDIUSTORQ) (. 494),&#xD;
      lateral distal tibial angle (.436) and quadriceps femoris muscle. torque (QUADRTORQ) (. 341),&#xD;
      respectively. In conclusion, strengthening the quadriceps femoris, gluteus medius and gluteus&#xD;
      maximus muscles may be suggested as an effective strategy to prevent ankle sprain. It may be&#xD;
      helpful to pay attention to individuals with high LDTA to prevent ankle sprains.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankle sprain is the most common type of ankle injury, comprising nearly 80% of all injuries&#xD;
      affecting this area. Among these, 77% consists of sprains involving the lateral ankle (1). In&#xD;
      sedentary individuals, the reported incidence is 5.2 to 6 per 1000 persons (2). Although the&#xD;
      reported risk factors for ankle sprain include asymmetric tension in the flexor muscles of&#xD;
      the ankle, increased body mass index (BMI), increased bodyweight, and younger age, definitive&#xD;
      data is lacking (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alignment of the pelvis, knee, and ankle has attracted significant research interest as a&#xD;
      potential risk factor for lower extremity injury. Also, the quadriceps angle (Q angle) was&#xD;
      reported to be an indicator for the biomechanical functions of the lower extremity,&#xD;
      reflecting the effect of the quadriceps mechanisms on the knee, as well as providing&#xD;
      information on patellar movements within the trochlear sulcus and on the functions of the&#xD;
      thigh muscles (3). Q angle is measured as the narrow angle between the line that connects the&#xD;
      anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to mid-patella and the line that connects the tibial&#xD;
      tubercle with the center of patella (3, 4). Currently, no consensus exists regarding the&#xD;
      normal value of the Q angle. While the American Orthopedics Society considers 10 degrees&#xD;
      normal and 15 to 20 degrees as pathologic, the normal values reported by Schulthies et al.&#xD;
      for males and females are 10 to 14 degrees, and 14.5 to 17 degrees, respectively (5). Several&#xD;
      studies suggested that Q angle may actually represent an independent risk factor associated&#xD;
      with increased risk of ankle sprain (4, 5). It has been proposed that individuals with knee&#xD;
      valgus and a Q value exceeding 15 degrees have an increased risk of lower extremity injury.&#xD;
      Also, a positive correlation between ankle sprain and Q angle was reported among recreational&#xD;
      basketball players (3). On the other hand, no direct correlations were found between these&#xD;
      two parameters in a study involving 45 professional athletes (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another parameter that can be utilized to evaluate the alignment disorders of the lower&#xD;
      extremity is the lateral distal tibial angle (LTDA). The average angle between the distal&#xD;
      tibial joint orientation line and the anatomical and mechanical axis of the tibia is 89&#xD;
      degrees. This angle is referred to as LDTA (Figure 1). An angle of less than 86 degrees and&#xD;
      more than 92 degrees indicate the presence of valgus and varus deformities, respectively (6).&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the association between LDTA&#xD;
      and ankle sprain. It is plausible to assume that pathological LDTA, which is one of the&#xD;
      alignment parameters of the lower extremity, may increase the predisposition to varus or&#xD;
      valgus sprains. Therefore, our study was based on the hypothesis that LDTA may have an effect&#xD;
      on the occurrence of ankle sprain, and thus it represents an intriguing research parameter.&#xD;
      Also, when proximal muscle strength is assessed in people with chronic ankle imbalance, lack&#xD;
      of muscle strength may be another potential risk factor for injury risk (9). This latter was&#xD;
      particularly evident in studies that showed that the abductor muscle defects may lead to poor&#xD;
      balance and neuromuscular adaptations in the ankle, therefore, contributing to increased&#xD;
      inversion moments, increased activation, and earlier activation of the ankle evertors. When&#xD;
      compared with athletes without injury, those with injury had weaker pelvic abduction and&#xD;
      pelvic external rotation strength. In contrast, a prospective study by McHugh and colleagues&#xD;
      concluded that the pelvic abductor, flexor or adductor strength had no role in predicting the&#xD;
      future risk of ankle sprain (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the published literature on the potential effects of Q angle on ankle sprain is&#xD;
      controversial. On the other hand, literature data on the role of LDTA and proximal muscle&#xD;
      strength on injury risk is also far from being clear. The primary objective of our study was&#xD;
      to examine whether Q angle, LDTA, and knee and pelvic muscular torque were associated with&#xD;
      ankle sprain. The secondary objective was to determine the parameter that had the most&#xD;
      prominent impact on ankle injury risk.&#xD;
