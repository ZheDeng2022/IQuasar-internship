  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 12.000 patients suffer acute stroke in Norway every year, but less than half of&#xD;
      them reach hospital within the current treatment window for thrombolysis. Stroke is the&#xD;
      third-highest cause of death and the number one cause of severe disability requiring long&#xD;
      time care at institutions. Consequently this has a high impact on society, patients and&#xD;
      relatives, in addition to high costs related to care estimated to approximately 10 billion&#xD;
      NOK per year. Although there are few studies on emergency medical communication centres&#xD;
      (EMCC) in Norway, some have shown that the performance of the emergency medical communication&#xD;
      centres can be improved. This project will seek to amend EMCC´s handling of acute stroke&#xD;
      inquiries using artificial intelligence (AI), thus contributing to getting the patient to&#xD;
      hospital in time for optimal treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators will collect data from all stroke patients discharged from&#xD;
      Helse Bergen in 2019 (approx. 1000 patients) via the Norwegian Stroke Registry (NSR). For&#xD;
      these patients, structured hospital data from Helse Bergen will be retrieved, and based on&#xD;
      these and the spoken content of their emergency call regarding the stroke, the investigators&#xD;
      will use machine learning to calculate the stroke risk. The connection of historical hospital&#xD;
      data to the spoken words in the emergency call, amplifies the analysis of emergency calls in&#xD;
      a novel way, in comparison to sound analysis alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After retrieving and connecting stroke patient data, the investigators train the deep network&#xD;
      using data from 2019. Accordingly, testing will be performed based on patients from the first&#xD;
      half of 2020. A separation of the data into training, test, and validation assures that our&#xD;
      trained network does not over fit on the training data and can reproduce similar results on&#xD;
      previously unseen patients. Finally, the investigators will compare the performance of the AI&#xD;
      with the current system through statistical analyses on data from a period of approximately&#xD;
      one year of live usage of the AI in AMK Bergen. This will enable us to evaluate to what&#xD;
      degree the system is able to improve within the decision process of the EMCC operators in&#xD;
      terms of sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summarized, the primary objective is to build a robust, working prototype of an AI system&#xD;
      capable of real-time identification of acute stroke for improved assessment in emergency&#xD;
      medical calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To implement an AI system capable of providing fast prediction of whether a patient is&#xD;
           suffering from acute stroke or not based on audio from emergency call and available data&#xD;
           sources within the hospital records&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prove that AI systems can be used to assist and improve the triage decision procedure&#xD;
           of the EMCC operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated result is to deliver fast (i.e. seconds) prediction scores to assist the EMCC&#xD;
      operator in recognizing acute stroke patients, which provides an improved sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity compared to manual assessment only.&#xD;

        All calls to 113 in Bergen will be subject to the AI. A warning will be given the&#xD;
        EMCC-operator if risk of stroke, when combining contents in the call and historical data in&#xD;
