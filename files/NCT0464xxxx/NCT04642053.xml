  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a complex, multivariate speech motor disorder&#xD;
      characterized by difficulty planning and programming movements of the speech articulators&#xD;
      (ASHA, 2007; Ayres, 1985; Campbell et al., 2007; Davis et al., 1998; Forrest, 2003; Shriberg&#xD;
      et al., 1997). Despite the profound impact that CAS can have on a child's ability to&#xD;
      communicate, little data are available to direct treatment in this challenging population.&#xD;
      Historically, children with CAS have been treated with articulation and phonologically based&#xD;
      approaches with limited effectiveness in improving speech, as shown by very slow treatment&#xD;
      progress and poor generalization of skills to new contexts. With the emerging data regarding&#xD;
      speech motor deficits in CAS, there is a critical need to test treatments that directly&#xD;
      refine speech movements using methods that quantify speech motor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a Randomized Control Trial designed to examine the outcomes of a&#xD;
      non-traditional, motor-based approach, Dynamic Temporal and Tactile Cuing (DTTC), to improve&#xD;
      speech production in children with CAS. The overall objectives of this research are (i) to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of DTTC in young children with CAS (N=72) by examining the impact of DTTC&#xD;
      on treated words, generalization to untreated words and post-treatment maintenance, and (ii)&#xD;
      to examine how individual patterns of speech motor variability impact response to DTTC.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy-two children with CAS, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years of age will be treated&#xD;
      with DTTC. This work will employ a delayed treatment control group design across multiple&#xD;
      behaviors. Participants will be seen in two groups: an Immediate Treatment group and a&#xD;
      Delayed Treatment group. Probe data will be collected during the Pre-Treatment (5 data&#xD;
      points), Treatment (12 data points) and Maintenance (minimum 5 data points) phases. The study&#xD;
      duration is 28 weeks in total duration for all participants. The study will address the&#xD;
      following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Quantify the effects of DTTC on improved speech production (perceptual ratings) in&#xD;
      treated words that are maintained post-treatment and generalized to untreated words in&#xD;
      children with CAS. The working hypothesis is that DTTC will increase accuracy of treated&#xD;
      words (primary outcome measure) and this effect will be maintained post-treatment and&#xD;
      generalized to untreated words. We also predict that DTTC will increase speech&#xD;
      intelligibility pre to post-treatment (secondary outcome measure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Quantify the effects of DTTC on refined speech motor control (kinematic/acoustic&#xD;
      measures) in treated words that are maintained post-treatment and generalized to untreated&#xD;
      words in children with CAS. The working hypothesis is that DTTC will be associated with&#xD;
      decreases in speech motor variability and duration of treated words (secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures) that are maintained pre- to post-treatment and generalized to untreated words.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Characterize the effects of speech motor variability (within-subject) at baseline as a&#xD;
      predictor of DTTC efficacy in children with CAS. The working hypothesis is that children with&#xD;
      CAS who demonstrate higher levels of speech motor variability at baseline will display&#xD;
      greater improvements in speech production accuracy following DTTC than children with lower&#xD;
      levels of variability at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be provided four times/week for 45-minute sessions. Principles of motor&#xD;
      learning will be incorporated into sessions by controlling the type of practice (blocked vs.&#xD;
      randomized), type of feedback (knowledge of results vs. knowledge of performance) and amount&#xD;
      of feedback provided.&#xD;

    <description>Dynamic Temporal and Tactile Cuing is based on principles of integral stimulation where the client watches, listens to and imitates the clinician (Strand, 2020). Treatment will begin by training the child to imitate and simultaneously produce syllables/words with the clinician. Sessions will focus on establishing accurate movement transitions in treated words. The child will be asked to imitate the clinician's production of the target. If the child's imitation is inaccurate, they will be instructed to simultaneously produce the target with the clinician. Simultaneous productions will continue to provide practice opportunity with maximal cuing. As the child gains greater accuracy, simultaneous productions will be faded and direct imitation will be attempted again. Over the course of treatment, the movement gesture will be shaped with the goal being accurate production with normal rate and naturalness.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). Diagnostic classification for CAS will&#xD;
             be determined according to the presence of the three core features identified in the&#xD;
             ASHA position statement on CAS: 1) inconsistent consonant and vowel errors over&#xD;
             productions of repeated trials; 2) difficulties forming accurate movement between&#xD;
             sounds and syllables; and 3) prosodic errors (ASHA, 2007). These three characteristics&#xD;
             must be present in more than one speaking context (i.e. single words, connected&#xD;
             speech, sequencing tasks). In addition to the three core features, children with CAS&#xD;
             must demonstrate at least four of the following characteristics: vowel errors, timing&#xD;
             errors, phoneme distortions, articulatory groping, impaired volitional oral movement,&#xD;
             reduced phonetic inventory and poorer expressive than receptive language skills, which&#xD;
             is consistent with the Strand 10-point checklist (Shriberg et al., 2012). We will&#xD;
             identify the presence of these factors from the Dynamic Evaluation of Motor Speech&#xD;
             Skills (DEMSS, Strand et al., 2013), Verbal Motor Production Assessment for Children&#xD;
             (VMPAC, Hayden &amp; Square, 1999), Goldman Fristoe Test of Articulation (GFTA-3, Goldman&#xD;
             &amp; Fristoe, 2016), and a connected speech sample. We have used these stringent criteria&#xD;
             for diagnosing CAS in our past research (Please see the Diagnostic Framework and&#xD;
             Criteria for CAS in Grigos and Case (2017)). The diagnosis will be made independently&#xD;
             by two speech language pathologists (one being the PI) with expertise in assessing and&#xD;
             treating children with CAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age between 2.5 and 5 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Normal structure of the oral-peripheral mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants must pass a hearing screening conducted at 20 dB SPL at 500, 1000, 2000&#xD;
             and 4000 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No prior DTTC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Positive history of neurological disorder (e.g. cerebral palsy), developmental&#xD;
             disorder (e.g. autism spectrum disorder) or genetic disorder (e.g. Down syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Characteristics of dysarthria, even if the child meets criteria for CAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Fluency disorder, even if the child meets criteria for CAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Conductive or sensorineural hearing loss, even if the child meets criteria for CAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of DTTC treatment.&#xD;
