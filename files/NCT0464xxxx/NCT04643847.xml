  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almonertinib is a three-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor(EGFR-TKI), which has shown competitive potential in the second-line treatment&#xD;
      against first-generation TKIs. This study intends to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery with sequential almonertinib in treatment-naive EGFR-mutant NSCLC&#xD;
      patients with brain metastases.&#xD;
