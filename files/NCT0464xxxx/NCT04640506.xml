      The study is a Diagnostic accuracy study that determining the accuracy of assessing the&#xD;
      gingival biotype and some other anatomic parameters,including (crown width / crown length&#xD;
      ratio, attached gingival width, labial bone thickness and papilla volume) by different&#xD;
      methods :1- probe transparency, 2-transgingival probing, 3-cone beam computed tomography,&#xD;
      4-intraoral digital scanning, 5-extraoral digital scanning&#xD;

      -  Patients will be recruited in periodontic department faculty of dentistry Cairo&#xD;
           university.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who already need esthetic rehabilitation treatment (implant placement,&#xD;
           restorative treatments, periodontal therapy, and root coverage) on anterior maxilla and&#xD;
           this treatment needs to investigate the gingival biotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral examination will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full mouth periodontal examination and charting will be done for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigation will be explained to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the investigations will be carried out by one investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dental patients will be received to the clinic (for esthetic rehabilitation treatment&#xD;
           such as implant placement, restorative treatments, periodontal therapy, and root&#xD;
           coverage on anterior maxilla).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who needs treatment will be investigated the gingival biotype by the five&#xD;
           measurement methods (PT, TP, CBCT, IDS and EDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients refusing to participate will be reported with the cause of their refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional clinical examination will be held on a dental unit using the light of the&#xD;
           unit, mirror and probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the investigation, the aim of the study will be explained to the patient and the&#xD;
           patient's acceptance to participate in the survey will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodontal status will be evaluated including assessment of gingival index (GI), plaque&#xD;
           index (PI), probing pocket depth (PPD) on aesthetic zone in maxillary teeth by using UNC&#xD;
           15 periodontal probe which is 15mm long probe with markings at each millimetre and&#xD;
           colour coded at 5th,10th and 15th mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then an investigator will evaluate the gingival biotype by probing Transparency (PT) as&#xD;
           reported by (Kan et al., 2010). The periodontal probe will be softly inserted into the&#xD;
           gingival sulcus till it reaches the sound bone on the labial side of the maxil¬lary&#xD;
           anterior teeth and it will be parallel to the long axis of the crown. The gingival&#xD;
           biotype will be considered as thick if the probe tip is not seen into the tissue and it&#xD;
           will be considered as thin if the probe was seen. If the thick en d of the probe was&#xD;
           seen into the tissue but the thin end was not, then it will be considered as a moderate&#xD;
           biotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second method of assessment to the gingival biotype will be carried out using CBCT&#xD;
           with lip retraction. It is important to note that the patients will not receive&#xD;
           additional radiation exposure for the purpose of this investigation and to give us clear&#xD;
           details about soft tissue, patients have already underwent CBCT examination as an&#xD;
           investigation method for aesthetic rehabilitation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Afterwards, gingival biotype assessment will be done by intraoral digital examination&#xD;
           (Kim et al., 2016). This is the third method; the investigation of gingival biotype of&#xD;
           the anterior maxilla will be done by means of a three-dimensional intraoral scanner. The&#xD;
           intraoral scanning data will be acquired in stereolithogra¬phy (STL) format and will be&#xD;
           matched with the CBCT data. Three highly radiopaque and relatively fixed positions in&#xD;
           the teeth will be chosen as fiducially markers to match the STL files with the CBCT&#xD;
           images in accordance with a best-fit algorithm using TRIOS software (3Shape).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, the fourth method for gingival biotype investigation will be performed by&#xD;
           extraoral digital scanning (EDS) of a gypsum cast of the maxillary teeth, then the&#xD;
           classic alginate impression of the max-illary arch and cast with dental stone will be&#xD;
           made, gyp¬sum cast will be scanned using a three-dimen-sional scanner, and the STL data&#xD;
           will be matched with the CBCT image according to a best-fit algorithm as in intraoral&#xD;
           method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of some anatomic parameters (crown width/crown length ratio, attached&#xD;
           gingival width, labial bone thickness and papilla volume) will also be performed.&#xD;
