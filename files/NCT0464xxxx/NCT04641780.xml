    <textblock>
      The objective of this post marketing surveillance is to further gather local data on the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Brexpiprazole (RexultiTM) Film-coated Tablet in the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenia and adjunctive therapy of Major Depressive Disorder.&#xD;

      DESIGN OF THE PMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a post marketing surveillance of 8 weeks duration, on 300 male or female patients&#xD;
      diagnosed to have schizophrenia and MDD in the Philippines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on his clinical decision, the attending physician will enroll patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia and MDD to the program. The attending physician will explain to the patient or&#xD;
      his legal guardian the purpose of the PMS and will obtain the patient or legal guardian's&#xD;
      consent that Brexpiprazole (Rexulti) Film-coated Tablet will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the safety aspects of Brexpiprazole (Rexulti) Film-coated Tablet will be collected in&#xD;
      terms of adverse events. Efficacy will be measured using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)&#xD;
      Scale (Severity and Improvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be done upon initiation, (Baseline visit), 4 weeks later (Visit 2), until&#xD;
      completion of the study week 8 (Study Completion). Demographic information and vital signs&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the treatment of schizophrenia, the recommended starting dosage for Brexpiprazole&#xD;
      (Rexulti™) is 1 mg once daily on Days 1 to 4, taken orally with or without food. The&#xD;
      recommended target dosage is 2 mg to 4 mg once daily. Titrate to 2 mg once daily on Day 5&#xD;
      through Day 7, then to 4 mg on Day 8 based on the patient's clinical response and&#xD;
      tolerability. The maximum recommended daily dosage is 4 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended starting dosage as adjunctive therapy for MDD is 0.5 mg or 1 mg once daily,&#xD;
      taken orally with or without food. Titrate to 1 mg once daily, then up to the target dosage&#xD;
      of 2 mg once daily. Dosage increases should occur at weekly intervals based on the patient's&#xD;
      clinical response and tolerability. The maximum recommended daily dosage is 3 mg. It must be&#xD;
      periodically reassess to determine the continued need and appropriate dosage for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≥7), the maximum&#xD;
      recommended dosage is 2 mg once daily for patients with MDD, and 3 mg once daily for patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with moderate, severe or end-stage renal impairment (creatinine clearance&#xD;
      CLcr&lt;60 mL/minute), the maximum recommended dosage is 2 mg once daily for patients with MDD&#xD;
      and 3 mg once daily for patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data will be limited to descriptive statistics only. Safety will be evaluated&#xD;
      based on the reported AEs per assessment. Efficacy will be evaluated using the Clinical&#xD;
      Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scales&#xD;
      to monitor severity and improvement from mean baseline score (before initial dose) up to the&#xD;
      last assessment (Week 8 - Study Completion).&#xD;
