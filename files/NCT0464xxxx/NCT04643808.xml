  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oromotor dysfunction and poor feeding is common after premature birth and hypoxic ischemic&#xD;
      encephalopathy (HIE). Pairing vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with motor activity accelerates&#xD;
      functional improvements after stroke. This study is designed to investigate whether&#xD;
      transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) paired with oromotor rehabilitation is tolerable, safe,&#xD;
      and facilitates motor learning in infants who have failed oral feeding.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Feeding difficulty is the primary reason for delayed hospital discharge from the neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit (NICU), with increased hospital costs and a negative impact on&#xD;
      neurodevelopment. Occupational or speech therapists typically start oral stimulation programs&#xD;
      early, then feed infants by mouth (PO) daily to encourage safe feeding while learning this&#xD;
      motor skill. Even after weeks or months of rehabilitation with therapists, many infants need&#xD;
      a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) surgically placed for adequate nutrition. With improved survival&#xD;
      rates of more critically ill neonates, the national rate of G-tube placement has doubled from&#xD;
      2000-2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulty learning the motor sequence for oral feeding may be due to brain injury from&#xD;
      infection, ischemia, and dysmaturity. In these infants, the normal integrative connectivity&#xD;
      that occurs after birth between the cortex, basal ganglia, and brainstem may be disturbed,&#xD;
      resulting in poor coordination and failure to learn the complex motor task of feeding, when&#xD;
      it should be a normal reflex. Therapies that facilitate motor learning and enhance feeding&#xD;
      skills would have a significant impact for infants who fail feeding rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In neonates with brain dysmaturity or overt brain injury, neuromodulation of abnormal&#xD;
      circuits may positively boost neuronal connectivity and enhance neuroplasticity. Vagus nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (VNS) paired with motor activity facilitates cortical reorganization and&#xD;
      neurogenesis, and improves motor function in animal stroke models. A noninvasive form of VNS,&#xD;
      transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS), targets the auricular branch of the vagus nerve to&#xD;
      activate vagal afferent and efferent networks. In adult patients with limb impairment after&#xD;
      brain injury, pairing taVNS with motor activation is safe, enhances plasticity and improves&#xD;
      functional motor recovery. This work in adult humans extends and supports the animal evidence&#xD;
      that pairing VNS with a motor or behavioral intervention restores brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators applied the model of taVNS paired with a motor behavior to infants in&#xD;
      the NICU in a prospective, open-label trial exploring the use of once and twice daily&#xD;
      taVNS-paired rehabilitation training to enhance oral feeding in infants who are failing oral&#xD;
      feeds and slated to receive a G-tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, MRIs are obtained before starting treatment, and at end of&#xD;
      2-3 week treatment period. In a subset of 10 patients the study investigators also obtain&#xD;
      modified barium swallows prior to and after the treatment period, with taVNS on and off&#xD;
      during swallowing. Daily feeding volumes as well as the slope of change of po feeding volumes&#xD;
      are recorded before and after starting taVNS.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study investigators delivered taVNS once or twice a day during a bottle feed for 2 weeks. Stimulation was paired with nutritive sucking and swallowing, and was paused during rest or burping. If PO feeds had not progressed after 2 weeks of taVNS treatment, the parents and the clinical team made decisions about timing of G-tube placement. If substantial progress in po feeds was made during the treatment period, but the infant was not quite to full oral feeds, the clinical team and parents could elect to continue for 1-2 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
