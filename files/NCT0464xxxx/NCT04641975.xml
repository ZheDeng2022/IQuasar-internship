    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of mirabegron in children (5 to &lt; 12&#xD;
      years of age) with OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of mirabegron in pediatric&#xD;
      participants with OAB and evaluate the pharmacokinetics after multiple dose administration of&#xD;
      mirabegron in pediatric participants with OAB.&#xD;

      placebo-controlled period (12 weeks); Follow-up period (2 weeks)) for a total duration of 18&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline to week 12/EoT in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours for age group 5 to &lt;12 years</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12/EoT</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a 7-day bladder e-diary (2-day weekend and 5-day weekday diary), at least 7 days before each visit or TC. Micturition is defined as the passing of urine, in the 2-day weekend diary this will be recorded as the number of urination episodes where the volume of pee is greater than 0, in the 5-day weekday diary this will be recorded as the number of times the toilet is used during the day or night. The mean number of micturitions per 24 hours will be calculated by taking the sum of all urination episodes recorded in the participant diary, divided by the number of valid diary days.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a 7-day bladder e-diary (2-day weekend and 5-day weekday diary), at least 7 days before each visit or TC. Mean volume voided will be derived from the 2-day weekend diary, total volume voided divided by the number of micturitions.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a 7-day bladder e-diary (2-day weekend and 5-day weekday diary), at least 7 days before each visit or TC. MVV data will be derived from the 2-day weekend diary, maximum volume voided is largest (non-zero) volume recorded over both of the 2 measuring days.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a 7-day bladder e-diary (2-day weekend and 5-day weekday diary), at least 7 days before each visit or TC. A daytime incontinence episode is defined as the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine during daytime hours. The mean number of daytime incontinence episodes per 24 hours will be calculated by taking the sum of all daytime urinary incontinence episodes recorded in the participant diary, divided by the number of valid diary days.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a 7-day bladder e-diary (2-day weekend and 5-day weekday diary), at least 7 days before each visit or TC. A dry (incontinence free) day is defined as a day where the response is &quot;Dry&quot; to the question &quot;How was your Day&quot; and to &quot;How was your Night&quot;. For a weekend day a &quot;Dry (incontinence free) Day&quot; is defined a day where no &quot;New pee or leakage&quot; is reported. Let Ddry be the number of valid diary days where the response to both questions was &quot;Dry&quot;. Let Dwet be the number of valid diary days where the response to one of the two questions or to both questions was &quot;Wet&quot;. If (Ddry + Dwet) &gt; 3, the number of dry days per 7 days was calculated as Ddry/(Ddry + Dwet) x 7, otherwise the value was missing.</description>

    <measure>Frequency of Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AEs will be coded using MedDRA. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an IP, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results a congenital anomaly/birth defect or other medically important event. The time frame reflects 12 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of follow-up, up to 14 weeks.</description>
