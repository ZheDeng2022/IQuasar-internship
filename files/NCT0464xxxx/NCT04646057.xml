  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares outcomes of prospective mesh-based breast reconstructions to historical&#xD;
      control breast reconstructions with no mesh.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plastic surgeons have a variety of biologic and synthetic mesh available for use. However, no&#xD;
      mesh has adequately evaluated safety and effectiveness for FDA approval or clearance for use&#xD;
      in breast reconstruction. Therefore, no mesh is an appropriate comparator for a randomized&#xD;
      clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center, prospective, clinical study with matched historical controls of total&#xD;
      submuscular 2-stage breast reconstructions with no mesh will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of DuraSorb® monofilament surgical mesh when implanted in subjects undergoing&#xD;
      2-stage breast reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women scheduled for mastectomy and immediate 2-stage breast reconstruction will sign informed&#xD;
      consent and satisfy eligibility criteria prior to the first stage of surgery and DuraSorb®&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum study follow-up is through one year after definitive reconstruction.&#xD;

          -  Scheduled to undergo either unilateral or bilateral mastectomy with immediate 2-stage&#xD;
             breast reconstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is able to understand the study requirements and is willing to provide written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is willing and able to return for all scheduled study visits&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of failed tissue expansion or breast implantation at the intended&#xD;
             reconstruction site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a residual gross tumor at the intended reconstruction site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has been treated for a systemic infection or a local infection at the surgical site&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has, as determined by the investigator, unsuitable tissue integrity for immediate&#xD;
             2-stage breast reconstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has undergone previous radiation therapy to the reconstruction site or chest wall&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  is scheduled to undergo post-operative radiation therapy at the reconstruction site&#xD;

             breast reconstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has been diagnosed with a comorbid condition determined by the investigator to place&#xD;
