  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circumcision is the most common surgical procedure performed by Pediatric Urologists.&#xD;
      Ketorolac has been shown to have an efficacy similar to morphine in multi-modal analgesic&#xD;
      regimens without the commonly associated adverse effects. This study aims to see if giving&#xD;
      ketorolac during the operation will result in better pain control. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      ketorolac will result in pain control similar to morphine with a lower incidence of side&#xD;
      effects such as nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We performed a pilot study in 2017 evaluating the perioperative use of ketorolac in&#xD;
      circumcision. Overall, there were no adverse reactions and ketorolac patients did not&#xD;
      experience significantly less pain that the control group patients. However, parental&#xD;
      perception of pain was lower in the ketorolac group when compared to the control and this&#xD;
      required more investigation. Based on our findings of the pilot study, we determined that we&#xD;
      needed at least 36 patients in each study group to come to a statistical conclusion. With a&#xD;
      larger study group perhaps a statistical difference in pain as measured with a FLACC score&#xD;
      may become apparent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, randomized, single-blinded study will be conducted from January 2021 - January&#xD;
      2022. A total of two groups will present with 50 children in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-generated randomized block design program will be used to allocate patients to&#xD;
      either the treatment (ketorolac) or control (no ketorolac) group. All children will receive a&#xD;
      15 mg/kg oral dose of acetaminophen prior to surgery unless contraindicated. General&#xD;
      anesthesia will be induced with sevoflurane via facemask. After establishing venous access, a&#xD;
      laryngeal mask will be inserted, and anesthesia maintained with 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic&#xD;
      concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane in oxygen/air 50/50 mixture. The DPNB nerve block will be&#xD;
      performed by a pediatric urologist using a 23 GA needle inserted below the Buck fascia. Once&#xD;
      the needle tip is positioned appropriately, and after a negative aspiration test, 0.2mL/kg&#xD;
      (maximum 10mL) of 0.25% bupivacaine is injected in small aliquots, with intermittent&#xD;
      aspiration throughout. In all patients, skin incision is performed at least 5 min after&#xD;
      placement of the nerve block. At the beginning of the circumcision procedure once the patient&#xD;
      is asleep, patients in the treatment group will receive a 0.5 mg/kg intravenous dose of&#xD;
      ketorolac. Patients will be advised to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen post-operatively as&#xD;
      needed, but not ibuprofen within 6 hours of the procedure. A 6-hour window between ibuprofen&#xD;
      and ketorolac is in line with our standard of practice at the Alberta Children's Hospital&#xD;
      when using additional NSAIDs after ketorolac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' demographic information, time needed to perform the block, time of block onset and&#xD;
      duration of surgery will be recorded. The mean arterial pressure, heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, expired sevoflurane end tidal concentration and MAC will be systematically&#xD;
      collected pre-operatively, intra-operatively and post-operatively in the recovery room. The&#xD;
      primary outcome of post-operative pain will be evaluated through the use of the Face, Legs,&#xD;
      Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) pain score or Wong-Baker FACES scale ascertained by a&#xD;
      nurse or research assistant blinded to the anesthetic technique. The usage of these two&#xD;
      scales will be performed as deemed appropriate by the research assistant. The FLACC scale&#xD;
      will be used in children who have difficulty verbalizing pain and in sleeping children&#xD;
      (regardless of age) while the Wong-Baker FACES scale will be used in patients capable of&#xD;
      self-assessment. The FLACC score is a well-established postoperative pain measure using 5&#xD;
      items scored between 0-2, which has been validated in patients from 6 months up to 7 years of&#xD;
      age. The Wong-Baker FACES pain scale that has been used post-operatively that allows patients&#xD;
      to select a face that relates to their current feeling of pain. These faces are rated on a&#xD;
      scale of 10. A FLACC or Wong-Baker FACES score will be recorded every 15 minutes for the&#xD;
      first hour and every 30 minutes for up to 2 hours following discharge from the PACU into the&#xD;
      day stay surgical unit. If the score is found to be &gt;3 (moderate pain 4-6, severe pain 7-10),&#xD;
      the patient will receive an intravenous morphine dose of 0.05mg/kg. An additional dose may be&#xD;
      given 15 minutes following the initial dose of morphine if analgesia is inadequate (score&#xD;
      &gt;4). Postoperatively, the child will be monitored every 15 minutes during the first hour and&#xD;
      every 30 minutes for the next 2 hours until discharge home. Discharge will be based on normal&#xD;
      institutional criteria including level of awareness, hemodynamic stability and absence of&#xD;
      pain, bleeding, nausea and vomiting. Prior to discharge, parents will be provided with any&#xD;
      additional analgesics required at home and will be contacted 24 hours following their surgery&#xD;
      to complete the parents' postoperative pain measure (PPPM). The PPPM is a well-established&#xD;
      post-operative pain assessment tool with high inter-rater reliability and construct validity,&#xD;
      which has been designed specifically for use by parents in the post-operative care of their&#xD;
      children. The measure includes 15 items scored between 0 and 1. The questionnaire will be&#xD;
      completed over the telephone at a time corresponding to 24 hours post-surgical closure.&#xD;
      Amount of pain and analgesia consumption data will then be collected by contacting the&#xD;
      parents 24 hours post procedure.&#xD;
