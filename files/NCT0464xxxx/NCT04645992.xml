  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraocular pressure (IOP) is maintained by a balance between aqueous production and outflow&#xD;
      with an imbalance leading to elevated eye pressure. Very high levels of IOP will subject&#xD;
      retinal cells to mechanical stress. In addition to mechanical injury, IOP elevation can&#xD;
      impair ocular blood flow reducing perfusion pressure to retinal neurons. Long-term vascular&#xD;
      and mechanical stresses can produce further injury at the optic nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) or ocular hypertension (OHT) is the only well-established&#xD;
      modifiable risk factor for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form of&#xD;
      glaucoma. Glaucoma is a class of optic neuropathy. It is main leading cause of blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma is classified on the basis of anatomic features as open angle (where the anterior&#xD;
      chamber angle of the eye remains open) and angle-closure (with closure of the anterior&#xD;
      chamber angle). Glaucoma is considered primary if the eye has no preexisting disease.&#xD;
      Secondary forms of glaucoma are caused by various ocular or systemic diseases such as pigment&#xD;
      dispersion syndrome and ocular trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems reasonable to consider that a longer duration of diabetes mellitus (DM) with a&#xD;
      prolonged insult to the retina and optic nerve via vascular, glial, and neuronal factors&#xD;
      would be associated with a higher risk of OAG.&#xD;

      patients with diabetic glaucoma (80 patients ) from both sexes will be divided to 2 groups,&#xD;
      40 patients for each group;&#xD;
&#xD;
      study group will receive only one session of 20 minutes yoga ocular training for 20 minutes&#xD;
      followed by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) by placing electrodes on skin&#xD;
      over urinary bladder (BL) acupoints 61 and 62 for 20 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      control group will be treated with the same protocol as the study group but with the TENS&#xD;
      unit is off.&#xD;
