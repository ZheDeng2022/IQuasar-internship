  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following 12 weeks of administration of BRIDIN-T Eye drops 0.15%(non preservative) or&#xD;
      ALPHAGAN-P Eye drops 0.15%(preservatives) for patients with glaucoma or Ocular Hypertensive&#xD;
      Patients. The use of BRIDIN-T Eye drops(non preservative) is less harmful to external&#xD;
      ophthalmicus diseases and increase of medication compliance for ophthalmic drugs than the&#xD;
      ALPHAGAN-P Eye drops 0.15%(preservatives)&#xD;

    <measure>IOP(Intraocular pressure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered 4, 12 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Data at 10:00 AM from Weeks 4, 8, and 12 were pooled. A more negative change indicates a greater amount of improvement. One eye (study eye) was subject to analysis.</description>
