  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease that is caused by various factors and characterized by&#xD;
      recurrent, episodic and temporary central nervous system dysfunction. In the past few&#xD;
      decades, despite the continuous development of antiepileptic drugs, there are still 20%-30%&#xD;
      patients with epilepsy progressing to pharmacoresistant epilepsy (PRE), which leads to a&#xD;
      significant increase in the morbidity and mortality of epilepsy. For those fraction of PRE,&#xD;
      surgical treatment may be the only possible way to cure epilepsy. Accurate presurgical&#xD;
      evaluation play an important role in making surgery decision and defining surgical extent and&#xD;
      achieve better surgical outcome. Imaging, especially interictal&#xD;
      fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is widely used in&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation, which is of great significance in the detection of epileptogenic&#xD;
      foci. Previous studies on FDG-PET have found that FDG-PET has a wide range of hypometabolism&#xD;
      inpatients of PRE varying from different epileptic origins. Therefore, exploring the&#xD;
      characteristics of glucose metabolism originating in different brain areas of resistant&#xD;
      epilepsy can help to better interpret the results of FDG-PET and guide the preoperative&#xD;
      localization of such patiens and better understand the potential mechanism of seizure&#xD;
      propagation in PRE.&#xD;

        We prospectively recruited 100 consecutive patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy at our&#xD;
        epilepsy center since Nov 2020. All the patients should have agreed to sign an informed&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: (a) Pharmacoresistant Epilepsy may be defined by International League&#xD;
        Against Epilepsy (ILAEï¼‰as failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately&#xD;
        chosen and used AED schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve&#xD;
        sustained seizure freedom (judged by two epileptologists); (b) conventional MRI negative or&#xD;
        nonspecific abnormalities; and (c) detailed information of long-term video-EEG, FDG-PET,&#xD;
        high resolution MRI (HR-MRI) and neuropsychological assessment were acquired, (d) focal&#xD;
        epilepsy defined by combining clinical, electrophysical and neuroimaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: (a) generalized or multifocal epilepsy or the patient's electroclinical&#xD;
        features were inconsistent with pharmacoresistant epilepsy; (b) idiopathic focal epilepsy;&#xD;
        and (c) unsatisfactory imaging quality.&#xD;
