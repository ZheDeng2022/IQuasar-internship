      The Management of my Bipolarity study aims to develop an educational intervention (MoB EI) on&#xD;
      the combined use of technology and face to face education on the empowerment of ill health&#xD;
      self-management skills in adults with bipolar disorder. The MoB EI will be developed&#xD;
      according to qualitative data on patients' educational needs and relevant literature. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of acquired knowledge and self-management skills will be assessed according to&#xD;
      the degree of a) cognitive functioning, b) impulse control, c) adherence to pharmacotherapy,&#xD;
      d) relapse prevention, d) improvement of quality of life of participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to develop and test an educational intervention for patients with&#xD;
      bipolar disorder (BD). The objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A literature review on BD educational programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exploration of the educational needs of adults with BD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Development of the MoB educational intervention (MoB EI), encompassing a face to face&#xD;
           (F2F) intervention and a technology-based intervention via a Digital platform (MoB DP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exploration of the effectiveness of the MoB EI in BD patients regarding i) their&#xD;
           knowledge on BD, and ii) empowerment of ill health self-management skills in relation to&#xD;
           the improvement of impulse control, adherence to pharmacotherapy, relapse frequency,&#xD;
           quality of life and adaptive attitudes towards substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This study uses a mixed-method design and consists of four stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: (a) To conduct a literature review on BD educational programs, and (b) define the&#xD;
      educational needs of adults with BD via empirical exploration of their living experience (a&#xD;
      focus group and content analysis will be implemented for this qualitative assessment), aiming&#xD;
      to integrate both data in the MoB EI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Design of the MoB F2F EI &amp; the MoB Digital Platform (MoB DP). ΜoΒ F2F EI:The design&#xD;
      of this intervention will rely on the Colom &amp; Vieta model, Cognitive- Behavioural techniques&#xD;
      and the results of the 1st stage (all relevant literature and data acquired in the&#xD;
      qualitative research of educational needs). A textbook will be devised explaining in detail&#xD;
      the step-by-step process and the techniques of the experimental educational method of the MoB&#xD;
      F2F EI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MoB DP: The structure of the MoB DP has been designed by the researchers of the present study&#xD;
      and a web developer, partially based on the preferences and needs of the participants (as&#xD;
      described in Stage 1); its goal is to create an ecosystem where people with BD will be&#xD;
      educated and empowered making use of the internet of things (IOT) via a computer, tablet or&#xD;
      mobile. The MoB DP will be in the form of a dynamic website with user generated content as&#xD;
      well as static information. A responsive design has been applied, i.e. accessible by all&#xD;
      types of devices. The platform is accessible to the participants in the current study, as&#xD;
      well as to any interested person, e.g., family members of people with BP, or care givers&#xD;
      providing updated information related to BD (platform users). The platform administrator is&#xD;
      the main researcher (AH), while the owner is the Nursing Department of the Cyprus University&#xD;
      of Technology (CUT). The participants of the proposed study will have the opportunity to&#xD;
      access the platform both during and after the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informative part of the platform is live (www.mob.com.cy), while the interactive part is&#xD;
      under development. The informative part, so far, includes the following functionalities:&#xD;
      self-management action plan, home-work exercises, self-assessment tools, scientific articles&#xD;
      relevant to BD. Entry into the platform functionalities (scientific articles excluded) is&#xD;
      password protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the users of the platform will have the opportunity to register by filling in&#xD;
      their personal profile and revisit when they wish. Regarding self-management functionalities,&#xD;
      the platform will contain subject units where personal relapse symptoms may be registered, a&#xD;
      life events table, personal risk factors for relapse and a weekly program of activities.&#xD;
      Input of relevant information will be through open-ended questions and check lists.&#xD;
      Participants of the MoB F2F EI who visit the platform, will find that these subject units&#xD;
      (chapters) are topics on which they will be educated on. Additional features will be&#xD;
      incorporated according to development of 1st stage, e.g., new training needs, as described by&#xD;
      participants in the focus groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another subject unit will be the personal therapy file, where users will have the chance to&#xD;
      keep tabulated notes related to their therapy, including information about the dose and type&#xD;
      of medication treatment, as well as pending medical test, e.g., blood test, and other&#xD;
      relevant information. The therapeutic team of the user will have the possibility to register&#xD;
      in the platform under the approval of the user with the aim to support continuity and sharing&#xD;
      of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: Implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of the MoB EI. All eligible&#xD;
      participants will be assigned into the intervention group and the control group. Based on&#xD;
      power analysis the intervention group will be constituted of 40 participants and the control&#xD;
      (waiting) group of 40 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for discontinuing participation in intervention group are disorder relapse and&#xD;
      non-adherence to pharmacotherapy (discontinuation of medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention description. The intervention group will receive the MoB F2F EI on group or&#xD;
      personal form according to the participant's choice. Also the participants of the&#xD;
      intervention group will have access to the MoB DP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation methodology of the MoB F2F EI will include videos and power point&#xD;
      presentations, as well as interactive learning methods such as role-playing, empowerment&#xD;
      exercises, live discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MoB F2F EI will comprise a total of 12 educational F2F sessions. Each session will have a&#xD;
      duration of 1.5 hours and the maximum number of participants in the groups will be 12&#xD;
      patients. At the beginning of each session, the participants will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      record their feedback for the previous session and the impact of the training program, so&#xD;
      far, on them and their families / significant others. The location where the MoB F2F EI will&#xD;
      be conducted is the CUT. The main researcher (AH) will implement the MoB F2F EI.&#xD;
      Participation in the educational intervention is free of charge. Also, no economic outcomes&#xD;
      are expected to emerge through this or any stage of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who will wish to withdraw before completion of the intervention, will be able to&#xD;
      continue to receive information/knowledge about their illness through the digital platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will have access only to the MoB DP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness evaluation. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the MoB F2F EI will be based&#xD;
      on the degree of improvement on the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Self-perceived quality of life level&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ability to control impulses&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Psychoactive substances use attitudes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adherence to pharmacotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Frequency of relapses&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. BD Knowledge level&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be four evaluation timepoints. The 1st evaluation timepoint will be prior to the&#xD;
      implementation of the MoB F2F EI, the 2nd will take place immediately after the completion of&#xD;
      the MoB F2F EI, while the 3rd and 4th ones will be applied six and twelve months,&#xD;
      respectively, after the completion of the MoB EI. These timepoints have been determined&#xD;
      according to relevant literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be assessed via the same evaluation tools as the intervention group,&#xD;
      and at the same time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will verify the hypothesis that patients who receive only pharmacotherapy and have&#xD;
      access to the MoB DP do not have the same improvement as intervention group in important&#xD;
      aspects of their lives, i.e., quality of life, cognitive functioning, impulse control,&#xD;
      adherence to pharmacotherapy, relapse prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis. Mean and standard deviation will be assessed for the scale numeric scores&#xD;
      (WHOQOL, DUDIT, MoCa, DAI-30, relapse frequency) and frequencies will be tested for&#xD;
      categorical variables (gender, age groups, group years in illness). Parametric tests (ANOVA,&#xD;
      t-test) will be applied for comparisons between groups. For all statistical tests, p values&#xD;
      of 0.05 or lower will be considered statistically significant. Data will be analysed through&#xD;
      the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL version 25.00). To test&#xD;
      the relationship between two or more variables logistic and linear regression analysis will&#xD;
      be used. Regarding missing data, multiple imputation method will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 4: Assessment of the applicability of the Digital platform. The assessment of the&#xD;
      applicability of the digital platform will be based on qualitative (users' feedback) and&#xD;
      quantitative testing (data analysis). Regarding users' qualitative feedback, there will be an&#xD;
      exploration of the experience of the users with the platform and the degree to which they&#xD;
      were positively affected by its use. This process will take place via focus groups&#xD;
      discussions. The focus of the interviews will be on the impact of the platform on their&#xD;
      everyday life, as well as on enhancement of ill health self-management skills. It is intended&#xD;
      to deliver 2 focus groups with 8-12 participants each. The participants will be among those&#xD;
      who (a) attended the F2F EI and at the same time had used the platform, (b) only had access&#xD;
      to the MoB DP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the platform will also take place through anonymous questionnaires by&#xD;
      asking the users of the platform to answer predefined questions regarding satisfaction&#xD;
      parameters relevant to the platform. The technology which will be applied for this process is&#xD;
      Google Forms. This part of the assessment is expected to take place during the second half of&#xD;
      2021.&#xD;
