  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The E-LUS study is a prospective, non randomised, monocenter case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the association of exercise lung ultrasound data acquired&#xD;
      during a stress test on a bicycle ergometer with the diagnosis of heart failure with&#xD;
      preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).&#xD;

      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the diagnostic performance of exercise lung ultrasound for the diagnosis of&#xD;
           HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the value of the B-lines score on exercise maximizing the sensitivity and&#xD;
           specificity for the diagnosis of HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the relationship of the delta of B-lines scores between rest and exercise&#xD;
           with the diagnosis of HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the diagnostic performance of the delta of B-lines between rest and exercise&#xD;
           for the diagnosis of HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify the score of the delta of B-lines value between rest and exercise maximizing&#xD;
           sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the relationship between the resting value of the B-lines scores with the&#xD;
           diagnosis of HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To assess the diagnostic performance of the resting lung ultrasound for the diagnosis of&#xD;
           HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To identify the value of the B-lines score at rest maximizing the sensitivity and&#xD;
           specificity for the diagnosis of HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To evaluate the correlation between the B-line score measured at rest and exercise and&#xD;
           the dyspnoea score measured at rest, during exercise, and during the recovery phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To assess the correlation of the delta of B-lines scores between rest and exercise and&#xD;
           the dyspnoea score measured at rest, during exercise and during the recovery phase.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The exercise B-lines score measured by the 8-point method.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 minutes after the end of the stress test</time_frame>
    <description>This score can have a value from 0 to 80, each anterior thoracic measurement point being rated from 0 to 10. A higher value indicate a higher level of pulmonary congestion. The measurement will be taken at the end of the stress test, in the first 2 minutes of recovery</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The diagnosis of HFpEF, as defined by a history of hospitalization for acute heart failure with preserved Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF).</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 minutes prior the start of the stress test</time_frame>
    <description>For secondary objectives 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8, the endpoint will be the diagnosis of HFpEF, as defined by a history of hospitalization for acute heart failure with preserved LVEF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>2. The delta of B-lines scores during exercise measured by the 8-point method between rest and the end of the exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Within 10 minutes prior the start of the stress test and 2 minutes after the end of the stress test</time_frame>
    <description>Regarding secondary objective 6, the judgment criterion will be the score of B-lines at rest measured by the 8-point method within 10 minutes prior the start of the stress test. This score can have a value from 0 to 80, each anterior thoracic measurement point being rated from 0 to 10. A higher value indicate a higher level of pulmonary congestion.</description>

    <measure>The B-lines score at rest measured by the 8-point method</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 minutes prior the start of the stress test</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The modified Borg dyspnea score at rest, during exercise and during recovery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 minutes prior the start of the stress test, at the peak of exercise and 3 minutes after the end of the stress test</time_frame>
    <description>For secondary objectives 9 and 10, the endpoint will be the modified Borg dyspnea score at rest, during exercise and during recovery. This scale is ranging from 0 to 10, 10 indicating a maximal level of dyspnea.</description>
