  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project comes forward with investigations regarding the use of yerba mate infusion in&#xD;
      sports performance, providing new knowledge about the effects of its consumption on the&#xD;
      performance of trained individuals, thus elucidating new mechanisms of ergogenic action of&#xD;
      the plant in characteristics of dietary management indicated for trained individuals, besides&#xD;
      investigating on the action of the bioactive compounds of the plant in the metabolism and&#xD;
      performance of athletes and the physiological aspects.&#xD;

      In this study, participants will be randomized into three groups: a group with yerba mate&#xD;
      infusion and carbohydrate meal, a group with only yerba mate infusion, and a group with water&#xD;
      and carbohydrate. The washout period between treatments will be seven days. The experimental&#xD;
      protocol will be carried out in the same period of the day (± 3h) to minimize the&#xD;
      interference of biological variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the procedures for data collection, the individuals invited to participate in&#xD;
      the study will be informed about the objectives and methods of the research and then, if&#xD;
      accepted, they will sign the informed consent form. The study will be divided into four&#xD;
      stages (baseline and the three different interventions). The baseline period comprises two&#xD;
      meetings, the first of which is to carry out a questionnaire to identify the participant, to&#xD;
      carry out blood collection of the intermediate vein of the arm, to make the analysis of body&#xD;
      composition and to be instructed on the exercise and feeding procedures during the&#xD;
      experimental protocol. In the second meeting of the baseline period, the participants will be&#xD;
      submitted to an incremental protocol on the cycle ergometer, and the data from this test will&#xD;
      be used for the application of the experimental exercise protocol performed later with&#xD;
      dietary interventions. From the incremental test, the maximum aerobic power, peak oxygen&#xD;
      volume, maximum heart rate, and lactate thresholds, energy substrate consumption, and&#xD;
      perceived exertion will be determined. In the three visits following the baseline period,&#xD;
      according to randomization, interventions will be carried out with the infusion of yerba mate&#xD;
      and carbohydrate meal, with only the infusion of yerba mate and with water and carbohydrate&#xD;
      meal. In intervention groups with yerba mate infusion, participants will be asked to ingest&#xD;
      seven days before the exercise protocol the same amount of yerba mate infusion as the test&#xD;
      day (250 mL). In this way, individual packages of ultra-refined yerba mate containing 5 g,&#xD;
      the necessary materials, and guidelines for the proper preparation of the infusion will be&#xD;
      provided. In groups that receive the carbohydrate meal, participants will be offered, one&#xD;
      hour before starting the exercise protocol, white bread with corn syrup, which will be&#xD;
      adjusted to their individual carbohydrate needs, in quantities that make up a total of 1g of&#xD;
      carbohydrate per kg of bodyweight of the participant, as recommended by the American College&#xD;
      of Sports Medicine and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all visits, participants will be instructed to arrive at the physical effort laboratory of&#xD;
      the Federal University of Santa Catarina in a 10-hour overnight fast, following the protocols&#xD;
      of dietary control and physical exercise in which they must maintain their usual pattern of&#xD;
      exercises and food throughout the study, except for the restriction of the consumption of&#xD;
      micronutrient food supplements, beverages with antioxidant and stimulating properties already&#xD;
      known, such as green tea, black tea, and wines, which may interfere with the results of the&#xD;
      study due to the similarity of bioactive compounds from yerba mate in the composition of&#xD;
      these drinks. In all these visits in which there will be dietary intervention, the&#xD;
      participants will assess their body composition and perform the exercise protocol to assess&#xD;
      their performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each of the three intervention visits, 60 minutes before the exercise protocol, a&#xD;
      carbohydrate meal will be offered (for when the individual is randomized to the group in&#xD;
      which this meal is consumed); 40 minutes before the exercise protocol, the infusion of yerba&#xD;
      mate or water (250 mL) will be performed; immediately before the exercise protocol, blood&#xD;
      will be collected from the intermediate vein of the arm to observe the increase in phenolics&#xD;
      in the blood promoted by the ingestion of the yerba mate infusion. Soon after, it will be the&#xD;
      realization of the effective exercise protocol to measure performance. During the execution&#xD;
      of the exercise protocol, blood samples will be collected from the earlobe to check the&#xD;
      variations of lactate and glucose. At the end of the exercise protocol, a new blood&#xD;
      collection will be performed in the middle vein of the arm to assess biochemical variations&#xD;
      that may have been influenced after exercise.&#xD;
