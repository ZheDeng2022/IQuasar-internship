  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Additional pharmacotherapies in the treatment of alcohol dependence are needed. Sodium&#xD;
      oxybate showed efficacy in the maintenance of abstinence in alcohol-dependent patients in&#xD;
      several small randomized trials of short duration. The aim of the present phase III/IV study&#xD;
      is to confirm in a randomized-controlled study the efficacy and safety of oral sodium oxybate&#xD;
      in the maintenance of abstinence.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence (AD) is the most severe form of alcohol use disorder. It occurs in 2.6% of&#xD;
      people aged 15+ years worldwide and can result in a reduction of life-expectancy by several&#xD;
      years as compared with the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, disulfiram, acamprosate and naltrexone are the main medicinal products registered&#xD;
      for the maintenance of abstinence in AD patients. Although effective on the group level,&#xD;
      effects sizes are limited, and many AD patients fail to respond to these medications.&#xD;
      Therefore, additional pharmacological treatments are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium oxybate 50mg/kg/day showed evidence of efficacy compared to placebo and naltrexone in&#xD;
      the maintenance of abstinence in AD patients in a series of open label and blinded randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs). However, studies were generally small and did not investigate the&#xD;
      sustainability of the Sodium oxybate effect post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present phase III/IV RCT (GATE 2) aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of oral Sodium&#xD;
      oxybate in the maintenance of abstinence. Secondary aims included the assessment of sustained&#xD;
      SMO effects during the 6-month medication free period immediately following the 6-month&#xD;
      treatment period and monitoring the risk of Sodium oxybate dependence.&#xD;
