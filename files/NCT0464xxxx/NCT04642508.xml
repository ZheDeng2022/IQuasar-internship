  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a prospective cohort study to assess the safety, quality of life&#xD;
      and cosmetic sequelae of prepectoral breast reconstruction in women with breast cancer and&#xD;
      high risk. The study's main objective is to assess the safety of prepectoral breast&#xD;
      reconstruction in terms of postsurgical complications and the feasibility of reconstruction&#xD;
      (loss of implants). The secondary objectives are to evaluate oncologic safety (local&#xD;
      relapses, residual glandular tissue) and to identify factors related to quality of life and&#xD;
      cosmetic sequelae. The evaluation of residual tissue will be conducted by magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging 12 to 18 months after the surgery, and the quality-of-life assessment will be&#xD;
      performed using the BreastQ questionnaire. An initial patient evaluation will be conducted&#xD;
      12-18 months after the surgery, and a second evaluation will be performed at 5 years. The&#xD;
      estimated sample size is 81 patients.&#xD;

      1. Mastectomy technique. The breast removal will be performed using a mastectomy adapted to&#xD;
           the breast and optimizing the preservation of the breast's original elements&#xD;
           (inframammary fold, skin envelope, fat transitions, nipple-areolar complex) according to&#xD;
           each patient's anatomical and oncologic possibilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reconstruction technique. The reconstruction will be performed by placing a silicone&#xD;
           implant coated with polyurethane foam in the prepectoral position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Preoperative assessment. All patients will be assessed by a surgeon of the breast unit.&#xD;
           The decision for the mastectomy will be made in consensus with the multidisciplinary&#xD;
           committee. Before the surgery, the patients will undergo a mammography and magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging to confirm the tumor size and rule out multifocality/multicentricity,&#xD;
           as well as an evaluation of the distribution of glandular tissue and transitions between&#xD;
           the breast and chest wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Breast magnetic resonance imaging. This study will employ the first magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging during the postoperative period (between 12 and 18 months) to assess the&#xD;
           residual glandular tissue following the mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. BreastQ questionnaire. The BreastQ questionnaire is aimed at evaluating patient-reported&#xD;
           satisfaction and quality of life through the use of breast reconstruction modules. The&#xD;
           preoperative format, which is delivered to patients before the surgery, and the&#xD;
           postoperative format, which is delivered to them 12-18 months after the surgery.&#xD;
           Likewise, we will conduct a second postoperative assessment at 5 years of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Images. The evaluation of the cosmetic sequelae requires taking photographs of the&#xD;
      patient's chest (from the suprasternal notch to navel). Photographs will be taken prior to&#xD;
      the surgery (frontal, right and left lateral), then again at 12-18 months and finally at 5&#xD;
      years of the surgery.&#xD;

To determine the sequelae, the criteria of the breast surgeon will be used, documented through photos.</description>
