  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, open-label study, the investigators will assess whether CytoSorb&#xD;
      hemoperfusion will prevent or attenuate the development of immunoparalysis in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers undergoing repeated experimental endotoxemia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is an inflammatory syndrome with high mortality rates and increasing incidence.&#xD;
      Sepsis-induced immunoparalysis, increasingly recognized as the overriding immune disorder in&#xD;
      sepsis patients, attributes significantly to late mortality in sepsis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that 'blood purification' techniques targeted at the removal of&#xD;
      excess circulating cytokines, such as the CytoSorb hemoperfusion device, might prevent or&#xD;
      attenuate the development of immunoparalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to determine the effects of CytoSorb hemoperfusion on the&#xD;
      development of immunoparalysis in a repeated experimental endotoxemia model in healthy male&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, 24 healthy male volunteers subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion into one&#xD;
      of two treatment groups (active or control). Both study groups will undergo two endotoxin&#xD;
      challenges, separated by seven days. To this end, endotoxin (LPS) will be administered as a&#xD;
      bolus of 1 ng/kg, followed by continuous infusion of 0.5 ng/kg/hr for three hours. The active&#xD;
      group will be treated with CytoSorb hemoperfusion during the first endotoxin challenge,&#xD;
      whereas the control group will receive no additional treatment. During both endotoxin&#xD;
      challenges, blood samples will be obtained serially to measure levels of circulating&#xD;
      cytokines and other inflammatory mediators.&#xD;
