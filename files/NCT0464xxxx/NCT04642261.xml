  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global epidemic with a prevalence of 25%.&#xD;
      Currently therapies for NAFLD patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) are limited, and are&#xD;
      associated with various adverse side effects. Sodium-glucose cotransporter type-2 (SGLT2)&#xD;
      inhibitors can reduce hepatic fat content in patients with DM. However, the role of SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitors in NAFLD patients without DM has not been investigated. Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM)&#xD;
      are non-invasive methods to diagnose hepatic steatosis and fibrosis/cirrhosis, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare the&#xD;
      effects of empagliflozin (a type of SLGT2 inhibitors) versus placebo (in a 1:1 ratio) in&#xD;
      reducing hepatic fat content as measured by MRI-PDFF in NAFLD patients without DM. A total of&#xD;
      98 adult patients will be randomly sampled from the liver clinic in our local hospital.&#xD;
      Empagliflozin 10mg daily will be given to the treatment arm. The placebo pill will be&#xD;
      manufactured to be identical in appearance to the study drug. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      followed up until week 52, and will undergo clinical, anthropometric and laboratory&#xD;
      assessments (including liver function test and fasting blood) at baseline, week 6, 12, 26, 40&#xD;
      and 52. They will undergo LSM at baseline, week 26 and 52, and MRI-PDFF at baseline and week&#xD;
      52. The primary outcome will be a difference in change of liver fat content (measured by&#xD;
      MRI-PDFF) at week 52 from baseline between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce hepatic steatosis in&#xD;
      NAFLD patients without DM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global epidemic with a prevalence of 25%.&#xD;
      Currently therapies for NAFLD patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) are limited, and are&#xD;
      associated with various adverse side effects. Sodium-glucose cotransporter type-2 (SGLT2)&#xD;
      inhibitors are antidiabetic drugs that reduce hepatic fat content in patients with DM, which&#xD;
      is independent of glycemic control. However, the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in NAFLD patients&#xD;
      without DM has not been investigated. Magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat&#xD;
      fraction (MRI-PDFF) is an emerging non-invasive imaging technique, and is more sensitive than&#xD;
      liver biopsy/histology in quantifying liver fat change. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by&#xD;
      transient elastography is a non-invasive method to diagnose fibrosis/cirrhosis with high&#xD;
      accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novelty of utilizing the concept of &quot;drug repositioning&quot; by changing the role of SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitors in treating DM to treating NAFLD in patients without DM deserves exploration. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare the&#xD;
      effects of empagliflozin (a type of SLGT2 inhibitors) versus placebo (in a 1:1 ratio) in&#xD;
      reducing hepatic fat content as measured by MRI-PDFF in NAFLD patients without DM. A total of&#xD;
      98 adult patients will be randomly sampled from the liver clinical in our local hospital.&#xD;
      Empagliflozin 10mg daily will be given to the treatment arm. The placebo pill will be&#xD;
      manufactured to be identical in appearance to the study drug. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      followed up until week 52, and will undergo clinical, anthropometric and laboratory&#xD;
      assessments (including liver function test and fasting blood) at baseline, week 6, 12, 26, 40&#xD;
      and 52. They will undergo LSM at baseline, week 26 and 52, and MRI-PDFF at baseline and week&#xD;
      52. The primary outcome will be a difference in change of liver fat content (measured by&#xD;
      MRI-PDFF) at week 52 from baseline between the two groups. The secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      remission of steatosis (MRI-PDFF &lt;5%) at week 52, reduction of liver fibrosis (LSM) at week&#xD;
      26 and 52, improvement of laboratory results (including liver transaminases and ductal&#xD;
      enzymes, fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile), improvement of anthropometric measurements,&#xD;
      and combined cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce hepatic steatosis and&#xD;
      regress fibrosis in NAFLD patients without DM.&#xD;
