  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of stroke has reached 795,000 a year worldwide, which cannot be overlooked. In&#xD;
      stroke patients, gait disorder is the most common among the complications of stroke, which is&#xD;
      known to have the greatest adverse effect. One of the important goals of rehabilitation after&#xD;
      a stroke is the restoration of symmetry and balance of locomotion to prevent complications&#xD;
      such as fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, various methods have been devised in addition to the conventional physical therapy&#xD;
      using physical efforts of a physical therapist as a rehabilitation treatment designed to&#xD;
      improve gait exercise capacity including body weight-supported treadmill training,&#xD;
      Hydrotherapy and robot-assisted gait training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Especially in the case of robot-assisted gait training, it is proven to be more effective in&#xD;
      terms of gait function recovery compared to the patient group who only undergoes conventional&#xD;
      physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robot-assisted gait training can be divided into two types according to the driven principle,&#xD;
      exoskeleton-type robot assisted gait training and end-effector gait training. Among them,&#xD;
      exoskeleton-type robotic gait training has distinctive feature from another type, the&#xD;
      guidance force, which assists the movement of the lower extremities throughout the entire&#xD;
      gait cycle according to a pre-set joint trajectory data based on healthy people. For patients&#xD;
      who are currently unable to walk, task-oriented sensory information can be provided using&#xD;
      this concept diversifying the degree of guidance force for affected lower limb as well as&#xD;
      unaffected lower limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have set the degree of guidance force to 100% at the side of affected limb at&#xD;
      first and then gradually reduce the degree of guidance force to the extent that the patient&#xD;
      is tolerable. In contrast, in the case of unaffected limb, there is no mention of the degree&#xD;
      of guidance force setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But, the most representative characteristic of walking is bipedal. Considering the fact that&#xD;
      recovering the gait symmetry is the biggest challenge for stroke patients, there is a&#xD;
      limitation when not taking into account the activity of the unaffected side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this respect, this study investigates the effectiveness of constraint-induced movement&#xD;
      therapy (CIMT) for lower extremity by modulating degree of guidance force during&#xD;
      exoskeleton-type robotic-assisted gait training&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a group of patients with acute hemiplegic stroke including subacute phases,&#xD;
      less than 3 months after onset were included. And all experiments were conducted over 4&#xD;
      weeks. The group was divided into three: the first group got conventional robot-assisted gait&#xD;
      training, guidance force given equally to both limbs. Second group received only conventional&#xD;
      gait therapy conducted by physical therapists without robotic gait therapy for the same&#xD;
      period of time. The third group got robot-assisted gait training based on CIMT concept;&#xD;
&#xD;
      100% guidance force is given on the unaffected side and then verbal ques are given not to&#xD;
      contract unaffected muscle voluntarily as much as possible are provided by physical&#xD;
      therapists, automatically according to the predetermined joint trajectory. In contrast at the&#xD;
      affected side, gradually reduce the degree of guidance force to the extent that the patient&#xD;
      is tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to analyze the clinical gait index afterwards to find out&#xD;
      whether the group that performed robot gait training using healthy leg restriction therapy is&#xD;
      more effective in improving gait pattern and gait independence than the rest of the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical gait index before, after completion of&#xD;
      therapy, and 4 weeks after completion of therapy among three group and prove the&#xD;
      effectiveness of robot-assisted gait training based on CIMT concept in the aspect of gait&#xD;
      patterns and gait independence index.&#xD;
