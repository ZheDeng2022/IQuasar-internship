      Two parts: A:Case-control study including 15 healthy adult donors and 15 severe adult&#xD;
      eosinophilic asthmatics selected for treatment with mepolizumab. B: A longitudinal cohort&#xD;
      study,where the same patients once on mepolizumab treatment are followed over time (0, 4, 16&#xD;
      and 32 weeks). SCOPE: response to mepolizumab in severe adult eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA: Male or female, 18-75 years-old, with severe eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Smoking history, recent exacerbations, other pulmonary or systemic&#xD;
      disease with eosinophilia, malignancy, pregnacy, obesity (BMI &gt;35). OBJECTIVES: General&#xD;
      objective: Discovery of predictive/prognostic biomarkers of response to mepolizumab using&#xD;
      flow cytometry, transcriptomic, and proteomic technologies. OTHER OBJECTIVES: 1.-To identify&#xD;
      changes in surface markers of eosinophils and eosinophil subpopulations in response to&#xD;
      treatment with mepolizumab using flow cytometry techniques. 2.-Transcriptomic analysis to&#xD;
      identify mRNAs within the eosinophil transcriptome displaying enhanced or reduced levels in&#xD;
      response to treatment with mepolizumab.3.-Proteomic profiling to identify proteins with&#xD;
      differential abundance within the eosinophils in response to treatment with&#xD;
      mepolizumab.4.-Check whether late-onset severe eosinophilic asthmatics display elevated&#xD;
      levels of IGF-1, IGF-BP3, IGF-ALS in serum samples, if the response of mepolizumab depends on&#xD;
      the levels of this markers, and if treatment with this biological reduces the concentration&#xD;
      in serum of these IGF-family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS: Flow cytometry assays with multimarker panels 1 (regulatory), 2 (activation),&#xD;
      and 3 eosinophil subsets. Clinical, hematological, biochemical and flow cytometry data&#xD;
      generated at times T4, T16 and T32. Total RNA extraction from eosinophil lysates, assay of&#xD;
      quality and quantity of RNA, and storage at -80ºC. Evaluation of the levels of 770 human&#xD;
      protein-coding mRNAs linked to the recruitment, activation, and effector functions of myeloid&#xD;
      cells by means of a direct multiplexed molecular measurement platform named nCounter®&#xD;
      NanoString) in combination with a pre-made &quot;nCounter® Human Myeloid Innate Immunity Panel&#xD;
      (v2)&quot;. erform retrotranscription and qPCR analyses of those mRNAs in eosinophils displaying&#xD;
      the greatest abundance changes in response to mepolizumab treatment according to the&#xD;
      nCounter® study. In addition, some additional mRNAs not included in the &quot;nanoString Myeloid&#xD;
      Innate Immunity&quot; panel, such as FOXP3 (regulatory function), CRLF2, ST2, or IL-7R (cytokine&#xD;
      receptors; activation), will be analysed. HPRT1 gene will be used as a house-keeping gene in&#xD;
      this set of RTqPCR experiments. Perform SWATH-MS analysis in samples from 15 healthy donors&#xD;
      and 15 patients (T0, T4, T16, T32) (&quot;information-dependent acquisition&quot; method or IDA;&#xD;
      &quot;Targeted label-free proteomics&quot;).&#xD;

      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hº1. The levels of certain surface molecules on eosinophils or the presence or absence of&#xD;
      certain proteins in the proteome of this leukocyte subset prior mepolizumab treatment can be&#xD;
      used as predictive/prognostic markers of response to this biological.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hº2. Mepolizumab alters the abundance of several surface or intracellular proteins in&#xD;
      eosinophils as an outcome related to changes in their activation status, migratory ability,&#xD;
      regulatory/effector function, or subset composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hº3. Late-onset severe eosinophilic asthmatics have elevations in the serum concentration of&#xD;
      different members of the IGF family (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, IGF-ALS) and mepolizumab treatment&#xD;
      reduces these levels and behaves as a response-biomarker along with the number of eosinophils&#xD;
      and clinical exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;

      from the study of the clinical data of patients before and after the administration of&#xD;
      mepolizumab. In addition, we expect to publish 3 publications in Q1 journals as well as other&#xD;
      2 or 3 congress communications resulting from experimental studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The study population will include healthy controls (i.e., subjects without&#xD;
      asthma, allergy, systemic diseases or scheduled for minor surgeries) and late-onset severe&#xD;
      eosinophilic asthma patients, who will be recruited from different areas of Galicia (Santiago&#xD;
      de Compostela, A Coruña, Lugo, Vigo, and Ourense), Spain. Diagnosis of severe eosinophilic&#xD;
      asthma patients at screening will be based on several inclusion criteria and exclusion&#xD;

        -  Smoking history: Current smokers or former smokers with a smoking history of ≥10&#xD;
           pack-years (number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years&#xD;
           smoked). A former smoker is defined as a participant who quit smoking at least 6 months&#xD;
           prior to Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

           COPD, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, hypoventilation syndrome&#xD;
           associated with obesity, lung cancer, alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and primary&#xD;
           ciliary dyskinesia) or ever been diagnosed with pulmonary or systemic disease, other&#xD;
           than asthma, that are associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts (e.g.&#xD;
           allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis, Churg- Strauss syndrome,&#xD;
           hypereosinophilic syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any disorder, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic,&#xD;
           renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic, haematological,&#xD;
           psychiatric, or major physical impairment that is not stable in the opinion of the&#xD;
           Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malignancy: A current malignancy or previous history of cancer in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute upper or lower respiratory infections requiring antibiotics or antiviral&#xD;
           medication within 30 days prior to the Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Xolair: Participants who have received omalizumab (Xolair) or another monoclonal&#xD;
           antibody previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have received systemic corticosteroids within 30 days before Visit 1&#xD;

&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort of healthy controls (n=15) only for analysis at T = 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort of n=15 subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma that start with mepolizumab&#xD;
           therapy with no modification to their currently prescribed medications. Follow-up study&#xD;
           visits at 4 (T4), 16 (T16) and 32 (T32) weeks after the original study visit (T=0).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The rationale for sample size is explained in the statistical section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated rate of enrolment Since this will be a multicentre study, we expect to reach a&#xD;
      rate of enrolment of at least 2 severe eosinophilic asthmatics beginning with mepolizumab&#xD;
      therapy per month (4 weeks) in each hospital (Total = 8 per month). This means that the 15&#xD;
      subjects should be scheduled to receive mepolizumab along the first 36 weeks of this study,&#xD;
      having enough time to complete the study in 72 weeks (1.5 years). We also expect that at&#xD;
      least 90% subjects complete this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated study start date: December 2020 Estimated study completion date: 1.5 years (72&#xD;
      weeks)&#xD;

      Study design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 2. Study design. This figure represents in a schematic way both the clinical and the&#xD;
      experimental parts of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, longitudinal, prospective, and multicentre study to evaluate both&#xD;
      the early response (4 weeks) and late-response (16 and 32 weeks) to mepolizumab therapy in&#xD;
      severe eosinophilic asthmatics. The study will be headed by Dr. Francisco Javier González&#xD;
      Barcala (Pneumology Service at CHUS). Dr. Barcala was national coordinator in one clinical&#xD;
      trial as well as principal investigator and sub-investigator in 41 and 19 clinical trials,&#xD;
      respectively. In addition, Dr. Barcala has been principal investigator of 7 research&#xD;
      projects, collaborator in other 7 projects, and published more than 120 relevant publications&#xD;
      (peer-reviewed and JCR-indexed) in the field of respiratory diseases, mainly asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also involves other members of the Multidisciplinary Asthma Unit (Dr. Francisco&#xD;
      Javier Salgado Castro, Dr. Juan José Nieto Fontarigo). In particular, the Project Manager Dr.&#xD;
      Salgado has been involved in 11 research projects, has 28 research papers in high impact&#xD;
      journals belonging to fields of Immunology, Biochemistry, Proteomics and Respiratory&#xD;
      Diseases. In addition, the other participants in this project have a broad experience in&#xD;
      their respective fields, both basic and translational research. They are Dra. Marina Blanco&#xD;
      Aparicio, responsible for the Asthma Unit at the University Hospital Complex of A Coruña&#xD;
      (CHUAC), Dr. Uxío Calvo, at the University Hospital Complex of Ferrol (CHUF), and Coral&#xD;
      González at the University Hospital Complex of Ourense (CHUO), Mar Mosteiro at Hospital&#xD;
      Alvaro Cunqueiro of Vigo; Dolores Corbacho at Hospital Povisa-Vigo . It will be necessary to&#xD;
      hire a researcher in the predoctoral phase for 12 months to carry out sample preparation in&#xD;
      transcriptomic and proteomic studies as well as the RTqPCR, flow cytometry and ELISA assays.&#xD;
      This researcher will be under the supervision of Dr. Francisco Javier Salgado Castro and Dr.&#xD;
      Juan José Nieto-Fontarigo (Multidisciplinary Asthma Unit, CHUS). Proteomics experiments will&#xD;
      be carried out by Dra. Susana Belén Bravo López and María García Vence, who work at the&#xD;
      Proteomic Platform at Sanitary Research Foundation of Santiago de Compostela (FIDIS). The&#xD;
      nCounter® analysis will be carried out through a service offered by the GENVIP group (Group&#xD;
      of Genetics, Vaccines and Infections in Pediatrics; https://nanostringenvip.com/), FIDIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project will be minimally invasive (e.g., no bronchoscopic examinations) but the&#xD;
      protocol needs to be reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Clinical Research of&#xD;
      Galicia, Spain. Only fifteen patients who meet the late-onset severe asthma diagnosis&#xD;
      criteria, are scheduled to receive mepolizumab, and sign the informed consent will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. The same protocol will be followed by the different clinical teams.&#xD;
      Demographic, as well as clinical, haematological, and biochemical variables will be included&#xD;
      in a database. Skin prick test to common allergens and the presence of allergen-specific IgE&#xD;
      (ImmunoCAP, Thermo Fisher) will be used to check for allergic sensitization. Lung function&#xD;
      parameters (forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC),&#xD;
      and FEV1/FVC ratio) also will be analysed. Spirometry will be performed before and after use&#xD;
      of a bronchodilator. The Asthma Control Test (ACT) and the Asthma Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (AQLQ) questionnaire will be performed. Asthmatics must be in a stable phase of&#xD;
      the disease (i.e. absence of exacerbations for at least 4 weeks before sample collection).&#xD;
      Exacerbations will be managed in accordance with standard clinical guidelines. Patients&#xD;
      (n=15) will receive 100 mg subcutaneous injection of mepolizumab at 4 weeks intervals, and&#xD;
      blood and serum samples (2-3 EDTA tubes; 1 SST tube) will be withdrawn at T=0, 4, 16 and 32&#xD;
      weeks, in order to evaluate both early-response (4 weeks) and late-response (16 and 32 weeks)&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tubes: EDTA (complete blood) and SST (serum)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eosinophils purification&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eosinophils can be isolated from whole blood (heparin tubes) using the Miltenyi&#xD;
                Human Eosinophil Isolation Kit (Catalog #130-104-466) or the EasySep™ Human&#xD;

        -  Total RNA purification from eosinophils and nCounter nanoString analysis&#xD;
           (Discovery-based/hypothesis-generating approach):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Purified eosinophils from healthy controls (T=0) and patients (T=0, 4, 16 and 32&#xD;
                weeks) will be stored at -80ºC in RNAlater solution (Ambion, Paisley, UK). Total&#xD;
                RNA will be isolated by means of a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and stored at -80ºC&#xD;

             -  The nCounter® platform (nanoString;&#xD;
                https://www.nanostring.com/scientific-content/technology-overview/ncounter-technolo&#xD;
                gy) is a multiplex methodology that allows the quantification of up to 800 RNA,&#xD;
                DNA, or protein targets. Regarding mRNA molecules, this technology is based on the&#xD;
                in-solution hybridization of every mRNA to two complementary oligonucleotides: a&#xD;
                biotinylated mRNA-specific probe and a mRNA-specific oligonucleotide containing a&#xD;
                sequential combination of six fluorochromes (four different colours) that create a&#xD;
                fluorescent barcode that identifies the specific mRNA being detected. Once the&#xD;
                excess of both probes is removed, the hybridised complexes are captured through a&#xD;
                biotin-streptavidin interaction and aligned on cartridge in order to the nCounter&#xD;
                instrument can read those &quot;barcodes&quot;. To carry out these steps, the nCounter&#xD;
                platform consists of two instruments the Prep Station, which performs the&#xD;
                purification of the hybridized complexes and their immobilization onto the surface&#xD;
                of a cartridge, and the Digital Analyzer (DA), a scanner that identifies and counts&#xD;
                the barcodes captured for each sample. This quantitative analysis Therefore, each&#xD;
                miRNA can be quantified individually (absolute quantification; counts) from&#xD;
                difficult samples (e.g., eosinophils) with no need for other requirements such as&#xD;
                mRNA-cDNA conversion (RT) or DNA-amplification (qPCR), leading to less data&#xD;
                variability&#xD;
                (https://www.nanostring.com/scientific-content/technology-overview/challenges-of-rt&#xD;
                ). In addition, the amount of input material is low (25 ng-300 ng mRNA) and can be&#xD;
                derived from FFPE-derived RNA, total RNA, fragmented RNA, cell lysates, and sorted&#xD;
                cells. Afterwards, nCounter data will be normalized, background noise subtracted,&#xD;
                and further correction performed to account for the efficiency of the extraction&#xD;
                (calculated based on the expression of spike-in miRNAs that will be added to the&#xD;
                sample in a defined amount before the miRNA extraction). Normalizations will be&#xD;
                done using the R NanoStringNorm package. After normalization, a log2 transformation&#xD;
                of the data will be made and subsequently analysed by means of the LIMMA&#xD;
                Bioconductor package to identify those mRNAs displaying a differential abundance&#xD;
                upon mepolizumab treatment. This analysis will take no longer than 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RTqPCR studies (Hypothesis-driven approach):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To analyse the levels of mRNAs encoding proteins related with alarmin-mediated&#xD;
                activation of eosinophils (CRLF2, ST2, IL-7Rα/CD127) and with the regulatory&#xD;
                function of eosinophils (FOXP3) from patients treated with mepolizumab, total RNA&#xD;
                will be transcribed into cDNA (QuantiTect Rev. Transcription Kit; Qiagen) and&#xD;
                stored at -80ºC. qPCR (QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit; Qiagen) will be performed in&#xD;
                a LightCycler® 96 Instrument (Roche Life Science) and used to analyse the&#xD;
                expression of FOXP3, CRLF2, ST2, IL-7R and the HPRT1 gene (endogenous control).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flow cytometry studies (Hypothesis-driven approach):&#xD;

                  -  Multimarker panel 1 (Regulatory proteins in eosinophils): Measurement of CD16&#xD;
                     and galectins-1/10 [41-44].&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Multimarker panel 2 (Activation receptors in eosinophils): Measurement of CD48&#xD;
                     (reduced in total eosinophils with moderated-severe asthma compared to HC [our&#xD;
                     studies, 54]), CD44, and CD11b.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Multimarker panel 3 (Eosinophils subsets): Analysis of subsets based on the&#xD;
                     expression of Siglec-8, CD62L(L-selectin), and IL-5Rα [40].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of eosinophil proteome (Discovery-based/hypothesis-generating approach):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  As much as 50 x 103 cells will be necessary to perform proteomic assays. We expect&#xD;
                around 50-400 x 103 cells from ∼1 mL of blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Isolated eosinophils (50 x 103 cells) will be collected by centrifugation, washed,&#xD;
                and resuspended in lysis buffer with proteinase inhibitors. After that, insoluble&#xD;
                material will be removed by centrifugation and cell supernatants stored at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For eosinophils total proteome characterization will be made after trypsin&#xD;
                digestion using a DDA method in a LC-MSMS system. For this approach we will use&#xD;
                samples from 15 healthy donors and 15 patients (T0, T4, T16, T32). The proteins&#xD;
                selected will be only those that reported a 1% Global false discovery rate (FDR) or&#xD;
                better [55, 56].&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Protein &quot;pools&quot; from the 5 groups of study (healthy donors and patients at time T0,&#xD;
                T4, T16, and T32 after treatment) will be used, dividing them (1-DE) in 5-6 bands,&#xD;
                extracting the proteins from each band, generating the corresponding peptides and&#xD;
                analysing them by MS / MS to produce a library for SWATH with a high number of&#xD;
                proteins, on which then the quantification will be carried out. Once the library&#xD;
                was made and maintaining the standardized conditions of LC-MS / MS (TripleTOF), we&#xD;
                will perform a SWATH-MS analysis (&quot;information-dependent acquisition&quot; method or&#xD;
                IDA; &quot;Targeted label-free proteomics&quot;) in samples from 15 healthy donors and 15&#xD;
                patients (T0, T4, T16, T32). This assay will let us identify proteins with&#xD;
                significant differences between the groups of study. The proteins selected will be&#xD;
                only those with a P&lt;0.05 and a fold change ≥1.5 [56-59].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data for all individuals enrolled in the study will be obtained at basal. In&#xD;
      addition, several data will be collected, including asthma history, lung function parameters,&#xD;
      skin prick test, allergen-specific IgE, AQLQ score, ACT score, the number of exacerbations,&#xD;
      and consumption of prednisone. During the following visits to the Pneumology service at T0,&#xD;
      4, 16, and 32, patients treated with mepolizumab will be followed up. This includes&#xD;
      measurements of lung function (FEV1, FEV1/FVC), biochemical and haematological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood and serum samples will be collected, and eosinophils will be magnetically&#xD;
      purified, at T0, T4, T16, and T32, and flow cytometry, RTqPCR, and proteomic analyses, as&#xD;
      well as immunoassays, will be performed. All the experimental variables (e.g., the abundance&#xD;
      of eosinophil proteins in proteomic assays, eosinophil activation markers, …) will be&#xD;
      correlated with clinical parameters (e.g., lung function, asthma control, number of&#xD;
      exacerbations) in order to assess the association of these variables with the response to&#xD;
      treatment. We will consider a favourable response to mepolizumab if one of the following&#xD;
      criteria is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain adequate asthma control ACT ≥20 [60], or/ a change of ≥3 points representing a&#xD;
           minimally important difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To achieve a reduction in the annual rate of exacerbations of 48%. Exacerbation is&#xD;
           defined as the increase in symptoms requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids&#xD;
           for ≥3, or an unscheduled medical consultation, similar to that reflected in clinical&#xD;
           trials with mepolizumab [20, 61].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get a 50% reduction in the annual rate of hospital admissions due to asthma&#xD;
           exacerbation, similar to that reflected in clinical trials [62].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To achieve a reduction in the median annual dose of systemic corticosteroids of 50%&#xD;
           [63].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IGF-1, IGF-BP3 and IGF-ALS levels in serum&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transcriptomic (nanoString)/mRNA expression data: FOXP3, CRLF2, ST2, IL-7R&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proteomic data&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Flow cytometry data: Expression of CD16, galectins-1/10, CD48, CD44, CD11b,&#xD;
                Siglec-8, CD62L, and IL-5Rα&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lung function parameters (FEV1, FEV1/FVC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Haematological parameters (e.g., eosinophils number).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other clinical and biochemical variables (e.g., IgE or other immunoglobulins).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of exacerbations, prednisone consumption, ACT score, AQLQ score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical plan or data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graph Pad Prism will be used to create graphics. IBM SPSS, Statistics 22.0, or R. will be&#xD;
      used for the statistical study. During the analyses, we will be assisted by the USC&#xD;
      Statistics and Operational Research area (Dr. Rosa María Crujeiras Casais).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The calculation of sample size (N) has been carried out by using G*Power 3.1.9.4&#xD;
      [64]. During these analyses we calculate N necessary get statistical significance in a F test&#xD;
      (ANOVA: Repeated measures, within factors), given α (0.05), power (1-β, 0.95), the number of&#xD;
      measurements (T0, T4, T16 and T32), and the effect size (f = 0.4; large effect size, which&#xD;
      gives as a more clinically relevant results). The output N was 15, with a critical F=&#xD;
      2.82705.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For clinical, flow cytometry and transcriptomic data. Cross-sectional comparisons between HC&#xD;
      and patients in T0 (before treatment) following a normal distribution and having homogeneity&#xD;
      of variances will be made by using t-test. For non-normal distributed variables, we will use&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test. Changes in the different study variables in response to treatment with&#xD;
      mepolizumab (longitudinal study; T0, T4, T16, and T32) will be tested using RM-ANOVA.&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis (e.g., PCA, unsupervised clustering) as well as functional enrichment&#xD;
      analysis will be performed with flow cytometry, and above all, transcriptomic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For total proteome characterization and quantitative SWATH analysis We will use&#xD;
      ProteinPilotTM 5.0.1 software from ABSciex which have the algorithm ParagonTM for database&#xD;
      search and ProgroupTM for data grouping. Data will be searched using a Human specific Uniprot&#xD;
      database. False discovery rate will be performed using a non-lineal fitting method displaying&#xD;
      only those results that reported a 1% Global false discovery rate or better [65].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional analysis will be performed by different open-access software. FunRich (Functional&#xD;
      Enrichment analysis tool) for functional enrichment and interaction network analysis&#xD;
      (http://funrich.org/index.html). For statistics, FunRich uses hypergeometric test, BH and&#xD;
      Bonferroni [66, 67]. We will use DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp) or GO&#xD;
      (http://geneontology.org/page/go-enrichment-analysis) for gene ontology enrichment and for&#xD;
      protein-protein interaction, network construction and clustering, we will use String&#xD;
      (https://string-db.org/) or Cytoscape 3.7 (https://cytoscape.org/ ) [68].&#xD;
&#xD;
      For SWATH data, MarkerView software will give us a multivariate statistical analysis using&#xD;
      principal component analysis (PCA) to compare the data across the samples. The average MS&#xD;
      peak area of each protein will be derived from the replicates of the SWATH-MS of each sample&#xD;
      followed by Student's t-test analysis using the MarkerView software for comparison among the&#xD;
      samples based on the averaged area sums of all the transitions derived for each protein. The&#xD;
      t-test will indicate how well each variable distinguishes the two groups, reported as a&#xD;
      P-value. For the library, its set of differentially abundant proteins (p-value &lt;0.05) with a&#xD;
      1.5 up-regulated or down-regulated proteins will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As previously commented, 15 subjects will be scheduled to receive mepolizumab during the&#xD;
           first half of the study (36 weeks). We expect that at least 90% subjects complete this&#xD;
           study. However, patient dropouts and non-adherence (or non-compliance) are common events&#xD;
           in clinical studies. In such a case, sample size will be proportionally inflated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The present project has been proposed as a study of the discovery of molecular&#xD;
           biomarkers in response to mepolizumab. This kind of studies can be boarded through&#xD;
           Targeted/hypothesis-driven or broader/untargeted (&quot;-omics&quot; technologies) approaches. We&#xD;
           are aware that it might be challenging to find predictive markers in this small and&#xD;
           prospective/proof of concept study. In the present project we propose a double approach&#xD;
           to minimize this risk. On the one hand, modern and untargeted methodologies to work and&#xD;
           highly sensitive to detect low-abundant proteins (SWATH MS) or simplified protocols to&#xD;
           work with difficult samples (generation of good quality RNA from eosinophils is always&#xD;
           challenging due to the presence of abundant proteins like EDN, a member of the RNase&#xD;
           family) and reduce technical variance (e.g., nCounter nanoString) in order to shorten&#xD;
           sample sizes. On the other hand, hypothesis-driven approaches (e.g., flow cytometry,&#xD;
           RT-qPCR, ELISA), with the advantages of a greater credence, less risk of type I (i.e.,&#xD;
           false discovery) and II errors, and easy to future replication of results. These&#xD;
           targeted-methodologies will be also used to confirm only clinically relevant (high&#xD;
           effect-size) and significant (p-value &lt; 0.05) differences obtained with untargeted&#xD;
           transcriptomic/proteomic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another potential limitation is the number of eosinophils, which could be potentially&#xD;
           low in some patient after treatment with mepolizumab (50 x 103 or lower). Therefore, it&#xD;
           could be necessary to purify more than 1 or 2 mL of blood in those patients in order to&#xD;
           achieve enough cells to perform the proteomic and transcriptomic experiments. We have&#xD;
           considered this issue in the study protocol and in the budget of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, the TripleTOF is highly sensitive mass spectrometer designed to dig deeper into&#xD;
           complex samples like the eosinophil proteome. The high sensitivity of current mass&#xD;
           spectrometers combined with bidimensional schemes of nanoLC allows the detection higher&#xD;
           numbers of proteins (&gt;1000) and analytes at concentrations in the attomolar range&#xD;
           (10-18), enough to detect low abundant intracellular proteins like chemokines or&#xD;
           cytokines. Thus, TGFα, TGFβ1, CCL5, CCL23, CSF1, CCL18, CCL24, CXCL12, and IL-18 have&#xD;
           been detected by nanoLC-MS/MS (Q-TOF), but not others like IL-5 or IL-13 [69]. This&#xD;
           expected limitation is due to the presence of peptides from highly abundant proteins&#xD;
           (e.g., eosinophil granule proteins) that suppress the ionization of peptides from lo w&#xD;
           abundant proteins in LC-MS/MS applications. This leads to the overrepresentation in the&#xD;
           list of detected proteins of abundant species such as the Charcot-Leyden crystal protein&#xD;
           (CLC, galectin-10), which is still interesting for the present project since identifies&#xD;
           eosinophils with regulatory capacities. However, in order to reduce sample complexity&#xD;
           and improve the detection of low-abundance proteins, there are different depletion&#xD;
           (e.g., ACN-depletion, ultrafiltration, 1-DE) and enrichment methods (e.g., CPLLs) that&#xD;
           we could use to gain detection sensitivity. Optionally, targeted approaches such as&#xD;
           high-multiplex immunoassays (e.g., the Olink Immune Response, Olink Inflammation, or&#xD;
           Olink Immuno-Oncology panels; https://www.olink.com/) have the advantage of a high&#xD;
           detection sensitivity with low volume of biological samples (e.g., cell lysates), even&#xD;
           though only allows the measurement of 92 protein biomarkers at once.&#xD;
