    <textblock>
      this is a single In-Clinic Encounter With the Notal Vision Home OCT study. The study&#xD;
      population will include up to 50 Age-related Macular Degeneration patients diagnosed with wet&#xD;
      NV-AMD in at least one eye at the time of enrollment. All enrolled subjects should have at&#xD;
      least one eye with active (wet) CNV (SRF and/or IRF) at the time of enrollment. All subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled at 1 site in the United States. in this study patients will be placed in a&#xD;
      room with the Notal Vision Home OCT device and following a completion of a self tutorial will&#xD;
      perform 3 unsupervised self-scans on each study eye (with a rest of ~5 minutes between&#xD;
      self-scans). at the end of the testing sessions, the subject will be asked to complete&#xD;
      subject user questionnaire.&#xD;

      Office Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the enrollment Office Visit, the exams will be conducted in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient will be informed concerning the study and sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF)&#xD;
           prior to conduct of any study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The following data will be collected for each study subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Subject's DOB (if allowed) or age&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Number and type of injections and last injection date&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Refraction correction&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Snellen BCVA on both eyes on the day of the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Eligible eyes of the subject will be scanned, non-dilated, with a Zeiss Cirrus OCT&#xD;
           device 3 times with one (1) acceptable volume scan of each eye being obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanning pattern to be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Macular cube, 6X6mm, 128 B-scans per volume scan NOTE: Any planned treatment for NV-AMD&#xD;
      should be administered after completion of all study-related scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Eyes of the subject that meet all screening criteria will be enrolled. NOTE: All enrolled&#xD;
      subjects should have at least one eye with active CNV (i.e., with SRF and/or IRF) confirmed&#xD;
      by commercial OCT scan(s) at the time of enrollment 7. The following data will be collected&#xD;
      for the study eye(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Qualifying diagnosis for the study eye from the subject's medical record&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. From the subject's medical record, the presence of other ophthalmic conditions including&#xD;
           but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Cataract ii. Glaucoma iii. Dry Eye iv. Other macula findings, e.g., epi retinal membrane,&#xD;
      macular hole, vitreo-macular traction (VMT) Following confirmation of subject eligibility,&#xD;
      subject will be placed in a room with the NVHO device which has been set up by a clinic&#xD;
      technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The clinic technician will register the subject using the touchscreen of the NVHO&#xD;
           device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The subject will perform a self-tutorial, without any help from the clinic's staff. The&#xD;
           training flow begins with demonstration clips followed by a practice phase. The training&#xD;
           flow will be followed by a self-scan that the system uses as a calibration session.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Note: If an eye cannot calibrate during 3 separate attempts or fails to test 3&#xD;
           consecutive times, the subject will discontinue self-imaging in this eye. If there is a&#xD;
           fellow eye also enrolled in the study, the fellow eye will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Following completion of the training and calibration session, the clinic technician sets&#xD;
           the device for testing flows. The subject will perform three (3) unsupervised self-scans&#xD;
           on each study eye with a rest period of ~5 minutes between self-scans. In case of scan&#xD;
           failures, the user will perform up to 3 additional attempts to complete the required 3&#xD;
           self-scans. The number of attempts will not exceed 3 times per study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At the end of each self-scanning, and during the 5-minute resting period, image results&#xD;
           will be automatically uploaded to Notal Health Cloud.&#xD;
&#xD;
           NOTE: Support provided by the sponsor will be available to study subjects throughout the&#xD;
           study including tutorial, calibration and scanning, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Once the subject completes the testing session in its entirety, the subject will be&#xD;
           asked to complete a questionnaire about their experience as a user of the NVHO device&#xD;
           and proposed naming options for the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Collect AEs, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Exit the subjects from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Self-scan data will be backed up on the NVHO device. Commercial Cirrus OCT data will be&#xD;
           copied to an external drive and sent to a Notal repository. Study visit data and subject&#xD;
           questionnaires responses will be entered into a Sponsor-provided CRF and sent to a Notal&#xD;
           repository.&#xD;
