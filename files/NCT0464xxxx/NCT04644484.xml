  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, blinded, randomized study of SYN023 compared to a China licensed Human&#xD;
      Rabies Immunoglbulin (a Rabies immune globulin from human sources, HRIG) for the prevention&#xD;
      of rabies as part of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The trial will enroll the WHO Category&#xD;
      3 rabies exposure subjects. The subject's death and rabies data will be reviewed by DSMB to&#xD;
      confirm the safety . Besides, rabies vaccine would be administered after Study Drug in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is proposed to further the licensure of SYN023 to provide an effective PEP&#xD;
      alternative available to those exposed persons who need such a product. A placebo-controlled&#xD;
      rabies trial is unethical thus HRIG is selected as the control group. Rabies immune globulin&#xD;
      from equine and human sources (HRIG) have been evaluated in many trials and HRIG is the&#xD;
      standard of care in China.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ⅲ, randomized, blinded, and active controlled study of SYN023 compared with a&#xD;
      China licensed HRIG for PEP of patients who have been confirmed to have met all&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria for their treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1000 patients aged 18 and above with WHO Category III rabies exposure should be enrolled as&#xD;
      planned and randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group based on a&#xD;
      ratio of 3: 1 through on-site stratification as part of PEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects should receive wound infiltration injection of SYN023 or HRIG on Study Day 0&#xD;
      (wound conditions should be described and recorded before injection, including diameter,&#xD;
      depth, expansion treatment, etc.), and should also simultaneously receive intramuscular&#xD;
      injection of one dose of the freeze-dried rabies vaccine for human use (Vero cells) into the&#xD;
      deltoid muscle. In accordance with the Essen Scheme, each subject also needs to receive one&#xD;
      dose of the freeze-dried rabies vaccine for human use (Vero cells) on Study Days 3, 7, 14,&#xD;
      and 28 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 mL of venous blood samples should be collected 8 times from each subject prior to&#xD;
      administration and on Study Day 3, 7, 14, 42, 98, 182, and 364 post administration of study&#xD;
      drug. Relevant information should be collected from the subjects through follow-up visits,&#xD;
      such as occurrence of rabies and survival conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RVNA should be assayed through rapid fluorescence focus inhibition test (RFFIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local adverse events related to the SYN023 injection sites and injection sites of the first&#xD;
      dose and second dose of rabies vaccine, and systemic adverse events (AE) other than injection&#xD;
      sites should be collected within 7 days after administration; local adverse events related to&#xD;
      the injection sites of the third dose, fourth dose and fifth dose of rabies vaccine, and&#xD;
      systemic adverse events (AE) other than the injection sites should be collected 7 days after&#xD;
      administration. In addition, all adverse events occurring within 42 days after administration&#xD;
      should be collected, and pregnancy conditions in 6 months after administration and all&#xD;
      serious adverse events (SAE) occurring during the study period should be collected.&#xD;
