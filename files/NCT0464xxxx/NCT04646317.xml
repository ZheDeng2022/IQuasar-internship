      Dexmedetomidine provides better hemodynamic stability to the patients with hypertension&#xD;
      undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgeries form an essence of today's surgical practice because of its&#xD;
      magnification, less cosmetic scar, less postoperative pain, and decreased hospital stay along&#xD;
      with less morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American Heart Association (AHA), approximately 86 million adults (34%) in&#xD;
      the United States are affected by hypertension, which is defined as a systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      (SBP) of 140 mm Hg or more or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mm Hg or more, taking&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive medication of those with high blood pressure (BP), 78% were aware they were&#xD;
      hypertensive, 68% were being treated with anti-hypertensive agents, and only 64% of treated&#xD;
      individuals had controlled hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetic management in these patients has become complicated due to cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      changes occurring during creation of pneumoperitoneum with CO2 and patient position required&#xD;
      for different laparoscopy surgeries. Effects of pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopic surgeries&#xD;
      on heart rate and blood pressure was recognized more than 50years ago and the magnitude of&#xD;
      the changes was observed to depend on the depth of anesthesia. The cardiovascular,&#xD;
      neuroendocrine, and renal changes induced by the CO2 pneumoperitoneum produce a complex&#xD;
      pathophysiological state remarkably similar to that in patients with chronic heart failure,&#xD;
      though the initiating event is clearly very different. In normotensive subjects these&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes are short lived5and probably of little significance. However, these&#xD;
      haemodynamic alterations are hazardous to the patients with hypertension, myocardial&#xD;
      insufficiency or cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various pharmacologic and nonpharmacological methods have been tried to limit the pressor&#xD;
      response following the creation of pneumoperitoneum. The success rate is variable with&#xD;
      different methods because each method has its own merits and demerits. In several clinical&#xD;
      trials drugs like opioids, β-blockers, lidocaine, nitrate calcium channel blockers or&#xD;
      magnesium have already been used orally or parenterally to obtund this sympathoadrenal&#xD;
      response. Recently, there is considerable interest in the use of α2-adrenergic agonists to&#xD;
      provide hemodynamic stability during pneumoperitoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine famous for its awake sedation is eight times more selective than clonidine&#xD;
      for the α2-adrenergic receptors. The ratio of α2:α1 activity of dexmedetomidine is 1620:1. It&#xD;
      activates pro-survival kinases and attenuates ischemia and hypoxic injury, including cardio&#xD;
      protection. Concurrent infusion during surgery reduces anesthetic consumption by 20-50% , and&#xD;
      produces a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure that may be advantageous for&#xD;
      hypertensives. Hypertension associated to pneumoperitoneum in normotensive patients has been&#xD;
      controlled with the loading dose of dexmedetomidine. So our rational is to see the&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability of dexmedatomindine in hypertensive patients undergoing&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum.&#xD;
