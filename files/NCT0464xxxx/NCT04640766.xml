  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label feasibility study. A maximum of 30 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled. 15 participants will be assigned and will undergo a novel neurofeedback&#xD;
      intervention, targeting down-regulation of deep limbic structures, specifically the&#xD;
      amygdalae. Participants will complete 12 neurofeedback sessions delivered twice weekly over 6&#xD;
      consecutive weeks. The intervention will be delivered via the PRISM platform.&#xD;

      The objectives include: 1)Training the NYU team on the electric finger print&#xD;
      electroencephalography neurofeedback (EFP-EEG-NF) technology and provide them with hands-on&#xD;
      experience; 2) Assessing participants' ability to learn the feedback paradigm (i.e. control&#xD;
      the EFP-EEG-NF signal; time to achieve learning; assess learning curves); 3) Exploring&#xD;
      preliminary results assessing target symptoms (e.g. AISRS and BRIEF-A).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Score on Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Between week 0 and week 9</time_frame>
    <description>ADHD symptoms will also be measured using the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS). Items are scored as follows: 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe). The maximum total score for the scale is 54 points, with 27 points for each subscale. The total score is the sum of the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive subscales. The higher the score, the more severe the symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Screening Scale for DSM-5 (DSM-5 ASRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Between week 0 and week 9</time_frame>
    <description>DSM-5 (ASRS) consists of 6 questions. Each question is scored in the range 0-4, for a total range of score of 0-24. The higher the score, the more difficulty the participant is experiencing handling ADHD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function- Adult version (BRIEF-A) self-report</measure>
    <time_frame>Between week 0 and week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of executive function will be assessed via the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function- Adult version (BRIEF-A) self-report. All 75 items are rated in terms of frequency on a 3-point scale: 0 (never), 1 (sometimes), 2 (often). The total range of score is 0-150; higher scores indicate poor executive function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Between week 0 and week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) will be utilized to objectify degree of depression severity. PHQ-9 is composed of 10 questions. The total range of score is 0-27 (the higher the score, the more severe the depression):&#xD;
0-4 indicates minimal depression 6-9 indicates mild depression 10-14 indicates moderate depression 15-19 indicates moderately severe depression 20-27 indicates severe depression</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Between week 0 and week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) will be used to measure participants' quality and patterns of sleep. The PSQI includes a scoring key for calculating a patient's seven subscores, each of which can range from 0 to 3. The subscores are tallied, yielding a &quot;global&quot; score that can range from 0 to 21. A global score of 5 or more indicates poor sleep quality; the higher the score, the worse the quality.</description>
