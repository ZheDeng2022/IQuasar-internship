  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a open label mutli-center open-label study to provide continued supply of itacitinib&#xD;
      to participants from Incyte-sponsored studies of itacitinib INCB39110-209 and INCB39110-230.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will receive treatment with itacitinib as per the treatment dose and&#xD;
      schedule they received in the study in which they were originally enrolled. This is referred&#xD;
      to as the parent protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who receive itacitinib in this study may continue treatment as long as the&#xD;
      regimen is tolerated, the participant is deriving clinical benefit (in the opinion of the&#xD;
      investigator), and the participant does not meet discontinuation criteria.&#xD;
