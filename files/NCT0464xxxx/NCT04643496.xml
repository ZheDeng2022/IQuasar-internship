      Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of the C-reactive protein as an early&#xD;
      predictor of intra-abdominal septic complicationss after ileocolic resection for Crohn&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Data collected between January 2010 and March 2020 will be analyzed. Informations&#xD;
      about preoperative, peroperative and post operative will be collected. The outcome after&#xD;
      surgery will be analysed according to the comprehensive complication index.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In colorectal surgery, inflammatory markers (CRP, PCT) are used systematically in the&#xD;
      postoperative period as an early predictor of postoperative complications and in particular&#xD;
      the prediction of anastomotic leaks and intra-abdominal septic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the occurrence of an anastomotic leak (5 to 15% of cases) involves the introduction&#xD;
      of antibiotics, the carrying out of invasive procedures which can go as far as reoperation&#xD;
      (and the establishment of ostomy) and always increases the length of stay and the cost of&#xD;
      hospitalization. It is therefore essential to benefit from the most sensitive and specific&#xD;
      tools to detect this serious and sometimes lethal complication at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have evaluated and demonstrated the value of monitoring the CRP in the early&#xD;
      postoperative period to detect the occurrence of an anastomotic leak. However, the majority&#xD;
      of these studies presented heterogeneous populations for two reasons: all types of colorectal&#xD;
      surgery interventions were included (right colectomy, transverse colectomy, left colectomy&#xD;
      and anterior resection of the rectum) and multiple surgical indications were taken into&#xD;
      account (colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, colonic diverticulosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a 2015 study comparing the postoperative monitoring of markers of inflammation&#xD;
      after ileocolic resection of patients with, on the one hand, Crohn's disease and, on the&#xD;
      other, colon cancer showed a greater inflammatory reaction in patients with Crohn's disease&#xD;
      (in particular on POD1, 4, 5 and 6) without identifying a threshold value. This increased&#xD;
      inflammatory response can be explained by a greater inflammatory state than in the general&#xD;
      population: bacterial translocation due to an alteration of the mucosal barrier aggravated by&#xD;
      immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It thus appears that the cut-off values usually used (170-175 mg/l on POD3 and 125mg/l on&#xD;
      POD4) are probably not suitable for the postoperative monitoring of these patients and for&#xD;
      prediction of intra-abdominal septic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study to date has identified a threshold value of postoperative CRP that can predict the&#xD;
      occurrence of postoperative anastomotic fistula and intra-abdominal septic complications&#xD;
      after ileocecal resection for Crohn's disease.&#xD;
