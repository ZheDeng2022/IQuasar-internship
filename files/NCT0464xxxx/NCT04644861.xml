  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elders aged 70 and over, living in Toulouse, with a chronic disease identified by the French&#xD;
      social insurance as an Affection Longue Dur√©e will be eligible to a 4 months physical&#xD;
      activity program in a primary health center. This program will be proposed by their general&#xD;
      practitioner. The aim of the study is to establish the feasibility of such program conduced&#xD;
      exclusively in primary care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of elders aged 70 and over and suffering of a chronic disease are increasing in&#xD;
      our country. These patients are at risk of sarcopenia which can lead to an increasing risk of&#xD;
      falls and hospitalization, loss of autonomy, and morbi-mortality. Twelve weeks adapted&#xD;
      physical activity program can manage sarcopenia in elders. One of the difficulties to propose&#xD;
      such a program to elders patients is the difficulty to reach the program center due to&#xD;
      mobility deficiency. Our hypothesis is that proposing an adapted physical activity in a&#xD;
      primary health care center, in the city of the patient, could help the participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients addressed by their general practitioner will perform 4 months adapted&#xD;
      physical activity program in the CAPA-CITY center (MSPU La Providence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion will be realized by the sports doctor of CAPA-CITY. At M2, sport doctor and&#xD;
      adapted physical activity teacher will meet the patient to readapt the program taking in&#xD;
      count his particularity and wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At M4 M6 and M12, an independent global evaluation will be realized by training nurse and&#xD;
      clinical research associate.&#xD;
