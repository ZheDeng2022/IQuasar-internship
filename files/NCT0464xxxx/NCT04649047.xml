  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This lifestyle behavior intervention aims to weight loss in low-income overweight or obese&#xD;
      mothers of young children through promotion of stress management, healthy eating, and&#xD;
      physical activity. All eligible women will be assigned to the intervention group. The&#xD;
      intervention will last 3 weeks and will be delivered via weekly web and individual health&#xD;
      coaching sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research in lifestyle behavior weight loss intervention has 3 limitations. (1)&#xD;
      Low-income overweight or obese mothers of young children have been significantly&#xD;
      underrepresented. (2) Prior lifestyle interventions in overweight or obese mothers have&#xD;
      suffered from threats to internal validity and have not specifically addressed motivation,&#xD;
      emotion, and cognition (especially executive function), all of which are critical for&#xD;
      promoting and maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes. (3) There has been&#xD;
      little evidence that any of the potentially efficacious strategies researched previously were&#xD;
      even possible under real-world conditions. The proposed small pilot study builds on strength&#xD;
      and effectively addresses limitations of prior research. The ultimate goal of the proposed&#xD;
      study is to create a more feasible and scalable intervention that can be easily implemented&#xD;
      and sustained in real-world settings. This self-directed, web-based goal-oriented episodic&#xD;
      future thinking intervention will focus on increasing motivation (autonomous motivation and&#xD;
      self-efficacy) and improving emotion (emotion control and stress) and cognition&#xD;
      (impulsivity). the will lead to weight loss and decrease risk of chronic conditions&#xD;
      associated with obesity, for example, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. All eligible&#xD;
      women will be assigned to the intervention group. The intervention will last 3 weeks and will&#xD;
      be delivered via weekly web and individual health coaching sessions. We will enroll 30&#xD;
      low-income overweight or obese mothers of young children with diverse racial and ethnic&#xD;
      backgrounds. All participants will be assessed at baseline (T1) and immediately after the&#xD;
      three-week intervention (T2). Specific aims are to to (1) assess intervention fidelity (dose,&#xD;
      delivery, receipt) and acceptability by the study participants, (2) investigate potential&#xD;
      intervention impact on the primary (body weight) and secondary outcomes (waist&#xD;
      circumference), (3) explore potential intervention impact on lifestyle behaviors (diet and&#xD;
      physical activity), (4) explore potential intervention impact on motivation (autonomous&#xD;
      motivation, self-efficacy, social support), emotion (emotion control, stress), and cognition&#xD;
      (impulsivity), and (5) assess cost of different recruitment approaches.&#xD;
