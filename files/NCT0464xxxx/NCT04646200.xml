      The goal of this project is to examine the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for&#xD;
      Insomnia (CBT-I) for improving sleep and related functional outcomes in Veterans with&#xD;
      psychosis and insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of CBT-I for reducing insomnia severity in Veterans with&#xD;
      psychosis and insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: CBT-I participants, as compared to those in an active control condition, will&#xD;
      show significantly greater reductions on the Insomnia Severity Index at post-treatment and at&#xD;
      a 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of CBT-I for improving the functioning of Veterans with&#xD;
      psychosis and insomnia. Hypothesis 2: CBT-I participants, as compared to those in an active&#xD;
      control condition, will show significantly greater increases in mental and physical health&#xD;
      functioning on the Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey at post-treatment and at a 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate the process that underlies the relationship between insomnia severity and&#xD;
      functioning in Veterans with psychosis and insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The effect of CBT-I on mental and physical health functioning at post-treatment&#xD;
      will be mediated by reductions in insomnia severity at week 5 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: The effect of CBT-I on mental and physical health functioning at the 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up will be mediated by reductions in insomnia severity at immediate post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: Explore whether psychiatric symptoms 1) moderate the impact of CBT-I on&#xD;
      insomnia and functioning and/or 2) change as a result of participation in CBT-I.&#xD;

    <description>CBT-I addresses cognitive, arousal and behavioral factors related to sleep difficulties. Sessions combine assessment, conceptualization, psychoeducation, behavioral strategies and cognitive therapy, using a consistent structure including review of participants' sleep log and adherence to behavioral guidelines, modification of time in bed, cognitive therapy, and relaxation techniques. CBT-I also incorporates psychoeducation about biological and psychological elements that regulate sleep. Other strategies include stimulus control (i.e., getting out of bed when not sleepy) to extinguish the conditioned arousal common in insomnia, and relaxation techniques to reduce arousal associated with the bed, bedroom, or bedtime.</description>

    <description>Health and Wellness is a general self-management curriculum focused on providing education and support for managing physical and emotional well-being. Each session follows a basic structure including review of previous session material, new educational information and discussion on several topics over the course of single or multiple sessions. Each session will focus on the impact of the topic on overall health and wellness, identifying benefits and challenges to improving or maintaining health in that area, and strategies that clients may find helpful to address challenges in that area. Example topics include physical activity/exercise, nutrition/healthy eating, managing medications and side effects, and addictive behaviors (e.g., substance use, gambling, eating).</description>
