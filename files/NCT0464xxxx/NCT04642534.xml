  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For women of reproductive age, the overall postpartum weight retention (weight gain between&#xD;
      pregnancies) plays a significant role in long-term obesity. With 20% of women retaining â‰¥ 5&#xD;
      kg at 12 months postpartum, the risk of developing conditions, such as gestational diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (GDM), metabolic syndrome (MS) and subsequently diabetes and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases, is substantially increased. In post-GDM mothers (women who had GDM in their recent&#xD;
      pregnancy), postpartum weight retention is also an essential predictor of future diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have identified the impact of circadian rhythms (influencing sleep/wake&#xD;
      cycles) and diurnal rhythm of eating (when and how often calories are consumed over a 24h&#xD;
      period) on cardio-metabolic disorders. In women, one remarkable feature of the postpartum&#xD;
      period is an 'externally imposed' circadian misalignment of both sleep and eating rhythms,&#xD;
      because most babies take several weeks to months to establish their daily pattern of activity&#xD;
      and feeding, which is particularly relevant for breastfeeding women, as the responsibility is&#xD;
      generally on the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this project is to explore the interplay between the diurnal rhythm&#xD;
      of eating, circadian and metabolic parameters in humans. The potential postpartum effects of&#xD;
      circadian disruption will be unraveled in women who had GDM during their pregnancy and those&#xD;
      with an uneventful pregnancy. These women are subject to a circadian misalignment due to&#xD;
      their 'externally imposed' changes in sleep/wake cycles and eating times in the postpartum&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a comprehensive approach combining molecular characterization of in vivo and in vitro&#xD;
      circadian clock parameters along with metabolic, endocrine, transcriptomic, and lipidomic&#xD;
      studies, the investigators will assess if eating duration and/or circadian misalignment&#xD;
      impact on circadian clock parameters of postpartum women in a prospective cohort of 6 months.&#xD;
