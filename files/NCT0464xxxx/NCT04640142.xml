&#xD;
          2. Documented and confirmed diagnosis of PID as defined by European Society of&#xD;
             Immunodeficiencies (ESID) and the Pan American Group for Immune Deficiency (PAGID) and&#xD;

             800 mg/kg/month. A stable dose is defined as one that deviates less than ±25% from the&#xD;
             mean dose for all infusions within this 12-week period before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Trough level of IgG ≥5 g/L at screening and documentation of an IgG trough level of ≥5&#xD;
             g/L at least once within the previous 12 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Current medical condition or history of condition known to cause secondary immune&#xD;
             deficiency, for example, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or&#xD;
             chronic or recurrent neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/μL).&#xD;
&#xD;

             response, or persistent reactions to blood or plasma-derived products, or to any&#xD;
             component of Newnorm (such as glycine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Severe liver dysfunction (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] &gt;3 times the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal for the expected normal range for the testing laboratory) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known protein-losing enteropathies or proteinuria (known urinary protein loss of &gt;1&#xD;

             glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤44 mL/min/1.73 m2, as defined by KDIGO Clinical&#xD;
             Practice Guideline) or predisposition to acute renal failure (e.g., any degree of&#xD;
             pre-existing renal dysfunction in presence of additional acute renal failure risk&#xD;
             factors, e.g. routine treatment with known nephrotoxic drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt; 7% / &gt;53 mmol/mol).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Uncontrolled arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure of ≥ 130 mmHg for the&#xD;
             subject under 13 years of age, ≥ 140 mmHg for subject 13 to 17 years of age, and &gt; 160&#xD;
             mmHg for adults).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Dysrhythmia/Tachycardia (resting heart rate &gt; 100 bpm for adults/adolescents and &gt; 120&#xD;
             bpm for children) and symptomatic bradycardia (resting heart rate &lt; 60 bpm for adults,&#xD;
             &lt; 50 bpm for adolescents, and &lt; 75 bpm for children in presence of symptoms e.g., low&#xD;
             blood pressure, abnormal rhythm, chest discomfort, shortness of breath). Physiological&#xD;
             sinus bradycardia in physically active adults/children/athletes is NOT an exclusion&#xD;
             criterion).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The subject has a history of or current diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or&#xD;
             thromboembolism (e.g. myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or transient&#xD;
             ischemic attack); history refers to an incident in the year prior to screening or 2&#xD;
             episodes over lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  equivalent) for longer than 10 days within the last 12 weeks before screening.&#xD;
                  Courses of corticosteroids (intermittent) of not more than 10 days would not&#xD;
                  exclude a patient. Inhaled or topical corticosteroids are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressants including chemotherapeutic agents 1 year&#xD;
             before screening or immunomodulatory drugs 12 weeks before the screening visit.&#xD;

             (incl. H1N1) are allowed. COVID vaccines (mRNA vaccine and a non-replicating viral&#xD;
             vector vaccine) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Treatment with any investigational medicinal product (IMP) within 3 months before the&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Presence of any condition likely to interfere with the evaluation of Newnorm or with&#xD;
             the compliant conduct of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
         23. Women who are breast feeding, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, or are&#xD;
             unwilling to use an effective birth control method (refer to protocol Section&#xD;
