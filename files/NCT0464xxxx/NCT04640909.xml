  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this biological study, blood samples will be collected from patients with CLL treated with&#xD;
      targeted agents (ibrutinib and venetoclax) to assess the impact of these treatments on the&#xD;
      generation of CAR T cells in terms of manufacturing efficiency, immunophenotypic&#xD;
      characteristics and functional properties.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a biological study aimed at analyzing the features of CAR T cells generated in CLL&#xD;
      patients treated with ibrutinib or venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this purpose, blood samples will be collected from patients with CLL before starting&#xD;
      therapy with ibrutinib or venetoclax and after 6 and 12 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be generated and tested for: (i) viability, expansion and&#xD;
      generation efficiency; (ii) phenotypic characteristics, in terms of CD4/CD8 composition,&#xD;
      differentiation subset distribution, exhaustion markers and expression of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      molecules; (iii) in vitro functional properties, in terms of proliferation ability, cytokines&#xD;
      production, cytotoxic activity and killing of target cells. CAR T cells produced from the&#xD;
      same patient at different timepoints will be compared. Phenotypic and functional data on CAR&#xD;
      T cells will be also correlated with main CLL prognostic factors (e.g. IGHV mutational&#xD;
      status, FISH abnormalities, TP53 mutation status) and outcome variables (response status,&#xD;
      duration of response).&#xD;
