      The primary aim of our study is to evaluate the effects of physical activity counseling and&#xD;
      pilates exercises on metabolic control variables in patients with prediabetes and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes; Its secondary aim is to examine the effects of both practices on physical activity&#xD;
      level, exercise capacity and quality of life, and to compare the relationship between those&#xD;
      under medical supervision by family doctor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes is defined as a disease that&#xD;
      occurs when the insulin hormone which is responsible for regulating blood glucose and&#xD;
      secreted by the pancreas. It cannot be produced individually or used effectively by the body.&#xD;
      It is a chronic disease with high morbidity and mortality and adversely affected by diabetes&#xD;
      complications. Purpose in diabetes treatment; control of the individual's blood glucose&#xD;
      level, prevention or control of complications. From the moment of diagnosis, healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle changes are recommended for metabolic control in individuals with diabetes.&#xD;
      Diabetes is classified as type 1, type 2, other specific causes and gestational diabetes&#xD;
      according WHO. 90-95% of diabetes cases diagnosed all over the world are type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      5-10% is type 1 diabetes and 2-3% is other diabetes types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During exercise, oxygen and glucose input to muscle cells increases and regular physical&#xD;
      activity provides metabolic control. Many studies have shown that physical activity has a&#xD;
      protective effect on impaired glucose tolerance and prevents the risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases and premature death in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, 60-70% of individuals&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes can not reach their daily physical activity goal and most of them can&#xD;
      not maintain their regular exercise program. In order to prevent patients from giving up&#xD;
      exercise early, it is important to provide personal counseling at certain periods, to&#xD;
      encourage, support and advice during exercises, and to explain the exercises in a way that&#xD;
      patients can understand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, patients with type 2 diabetes will be randomly divided into 3 groups as&#xD;
      physical activity counseling and pilates exercise group, only physical activity counseling&#xD;
      group, and control followed only with family physician recommendations and follow-up. It is&#xD;
      planned to do the pilates exercises for 50 minutes a day, 2 days a week during 12 weeks with&#xD;
      physiotherapist. Pilates group patient will make pilates exercise once a week alone.&#xD;
      Individual exercise sessions will start with 5-10 minutes of warm-up exercises and end with&#xD;
      cool-down exercises in the same time. Overall in the program; stretching exercises in&#xD;
      different positions (standing and lying), exercises to increase the flexibility of the trunk&#xD;
      muscles, upper extremity movements with and without an exercise ball, strengthening exercises&#xD;
      with theraband will be applied. Types of movements to strengthen all abdominal muscles,&#xD;
      muscles around the hips, back muscles, muscles in the shoulder girdle (shoulder bridge,&#xD;
      corkscrew, roll-up, roll down, clam, side kick, staggered legs, scissors, swimming, swan&#xD;
      dive, breast stroke preparation, Abdominal preparation, oblique preparation) will be used&#xD;
      alternately in different sessions, from easy to difficult. Pilates exercises will be&#xD;
      performed with light and relaxing music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the scope of physical activity, moderate and / or high intensity aerobic exercise&#xD;
      recommended by cIntegrating physical activity in primary care practice. The American Journal&#xD;
      of Medicine (ACSM) will be recommended 150 minutes in a week. Care will be taken not to take&#xD;
      a break for more than 2 days between two exercise days. In addition, strengthening exercises&#xD;
      that will maintain or increase muscle strength including large muscle groups at least 3 days&#xD;
      a week will be determined in accordance with the patient's current possibilities.&#xD;
      Recommendations will be given for possible complications such as hypoglycemia during and&#xD;
      after exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During physical activity counseling, considering the current physical and metabolic status of&#xD;
      the person, the person-based 5A model of ACSM will be adapted to individuals with diabetes&#xD;
      and physical activity consultancy will be provided. The 5A model consists of assess, advise,&#xD;
      agree, assist, and arrange subsections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess: The person's level of knowledge about physical activity and diabetes, his&#xD;
           perspective on exercise, his exercise history, readiness for change, fatigue, personal&#xD;
           history and family history, and drug use will be evaluated. By asking open-ended&#xD;
           questions, his attitude towards exercise will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Advise: The benefits of physical activity and the risks of physical inactivity will be&#xD;
           explained, morbidities that may develop due to diabetes, the relationship of diabetes&#xD;
           with physical activity, and exercise types will be mentioned. Short-term and long-term&#xD;
           effects of exercise will be explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Agree: Cooperation will be made with the client in line with the person's wishes,&#xD;
           interests and physical activity goals. Environmental resources for physical activity&#xD;
           will be evaluated and appropriate guidance will be made. OMRON HJ 109 brand pedometer&#xD;
           will be used for determining, monitoring and improving the level of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assist: Misunderstanding situations will be explained by helping the person identify and&#xD;
           solve their problems with physical activity. Potential resources park, gym, etc.,&#xD;
           solutions will be produced together for the obstacles on the way to physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Arrange: A follow-up meeting will be held with the client one day a week, and the target&#xD;
           will be determined for the next week. At the end of the interviews, the situation is&#xD;
           summarized and it is aimed to increase clarity. During the interviews, motivational&#xD;
           interview technique will be applied by the consultant, and a person-centered approach&#xD;
           will be provided by establishing empathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the 12-week intervention program of all patients, metabolic control&#xD;
      variables (body mass index, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c value, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglyceride values) will be evaluated. Physical activity levels with IPAQ, exercise capacity&#xD;
      with 6-minute walking test (6MWT), functional balance with Berg balance test and quality of&#xD;
      life with SF-36 will be evaluated. Body fat percentage, visceral fat amount, body mass index&#xD;
      and muscle mass amounts in the trunk and extremities will be calculated with the Jawon&#xD;
      X-Contact 350 device. Exercise intensity during exercise will be determined by speaking test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic control variables will be analyzed in the Healthy Life Park Blood Collection Unit&#xD;
      affiliated to Iskenderun District Health Directorate after the permits are taken. Evaluation&#xD;
      methods, exercise and consultancy applications will be carried out in Iskenderun Healthy Life&#xD;
      Center. Only the participants in the family doctor follow-up will continue their routine&#xD;
      doctor checks and recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An &quot;Assessment Form&quot; will be created to record the demographic and disease information of all&#xD;
      cases included in the study. Diabetes year, prediabetes diagnosis time, history, family&#xD;
      history, treatments taken, medications used, posture analysis with New York Posture Analysis,&#xD;
      range of motion, muscle strength and shortness assessment and foot examination will be&#xD;
      recorded in the evaluation form. Semmes Weinstein monofilament will be used for foot&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyzes will be performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) for&#xD;
      Windows 22. The compliance of the data to normal distribution will be evaluated by drawing&#xD;
      the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and histogram. Parametric tests will be used for data suitable&#xD;
      for normal distribution. Data that are not suitable for normal distribution will be analyzed&#xD;
      with non-parametric tests. Variables will be defined by their mean and standard deviation&#xD;
      values. Analyzes and correlations between groups will be examined separately with appropriate&#xD;
      tests. A value of p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
