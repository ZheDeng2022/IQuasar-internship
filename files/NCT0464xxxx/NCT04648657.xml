      The investigators suppose that lung sliding could be reduced in the same lung region moving&#xD;
      from less ventilated to overinflated condition. This is supported by theoretical arguments by&#xD;
      some authors but so far it has not been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suppose that speckle tracking applied to LUS is able to demonstrate a&#xD;
      reduction or abolition in pleural sliding when lung tissue is overinflated by higher PEEP&#xD;
      after lung recruitment maneuver. The overinflation is diagnosed by Electric Impedance&#xD;
      Tomography (EIT) and mechanical respiratory measurements (reduction in compliance as ratio&#xD;
      between tidal volume over difference between plateau pressure and PEEP) and localized by EIT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung ultrasonography (LUS) is a rapid, easy and non-invasive bedside tool for the detection&#xD;
      of specific ultrasound patterns, associated with several pulmonary and pleural disorders. The&#xD;
      main limitation of studies assessing lung recruitability and lung monitoring during&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation is the lack of detection of lung overinflation: the A pattern doesn't&#xD;
      change if the lung tissue is completely re-aerated or is overinflated. Considering this, the&#xD;
      investigators could not use LUS to guide lung recruitment due to the risk of lung damage.&#xD;
      Speckle tracking echocardiography is a gray-scale based technique used for quantification of&#xD;
      myocardial strain to provide a quantitative, objective measure of left ventricle (LV)&#xD;
      systolic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suppose that lung sliding could be reduced in the same lung region moving&#xD;
      from less ventilated to overinflated condition. This is supported by theoretical arguments by&#xD;
      some authors but so far it has not been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suppose that speckle tracking is able to demonstrate a reduction or&#xD;
      abolition in pleural sliding when lung tissue is overinflated by higher PEEP after lung&#xD;
      recruitment maneuver. The overinflation is diagnosed by EIT and mechanical respiratory&#xD;
      measurements (reduction in compliance as ratio between tidal volume over difference between&#xD;
      plateau pressure and PEEP) and localized by EIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: agreement between LUS and EIT to diagnose lung overdistension in Acute&#xD;
      Hypoxaemic Respiratory failure patients during a PEEP trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are ventilated in pressure controlled mode with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted&#xD;
      body weight (PBW), respiratory rate (RR) is maintained as set per clinical management, I:E =&#xD;
      1:2, PEEP level is set at 5 cmH2O and inspiratory fraction of O2 (FiO2) at 100% before&#xD;
      starting the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To check the presence of areas with reduced or absent pleural sliding not depending on&#xD;
      overdistention, and to exclude absence of lung pulse due to pneumothorax, a basal LUS&#xD;
      examination is performed before recruiting manoeuvre (RM): the ultrasound linear probe (12&#xD;
      megahertz, GE) is positioned parallel into the 4th-5th right intercostal space next to the&#xD;
      sternal margin for the first acquisition; then other two acquisitions along the intercostal&#xD;
      space from the medial part to the lateral side of the thorax are recorded; the procedure is&#xD;
      repeated on the left side resulting in a final acquisition of 3 ultrasound clips of 10&#xD;
      seconds for each hemithorax. If the presence of pneumothorax is suspected or diagnosed&#xD;
      (absence of lung pulse), the patient is excluded from the study according to exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then at the same level, marked with a dermographic pen, the EIT belt is positioned and a&#xD;
      basal assessment of lung impedance is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that a 40x40 RM is performed, setting a PEEP of 40 cmH2O for 40 seconds on continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure mode mode. If hemodynamic instability or decrease in oxygen&#xD;
      saturation occurs during the maneuver, RM is interrupted and previous ventilator settings&#xD;
      restored until stability is obtained and the patient discharged from the protocol. If the&#xD;
      presence of pneumothorax is suspected or diagnosed (absence of lung pulse), the patient is&#xD;
      excluded from the study according to exclusion criteria and clinically managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilation is then set again in volume controlled mode with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg and a&#xD;
      PEEP set to reach a maximum plateau pressure of 30 cmH20. I:E ratio and RR are left&#xD;
      unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decremental PEEP trial is performed reducing PEEP value of 2 cmH2O, static compliance is&#xD;
      calculated with an inspiratory pause of 3 seconds just before PEEP modification, and a&#xD;
      registration of EIT is acquired for each PEEP level. The PEEP trial starts with the maximum&#xD;
      PEEP level (PEEPmax, which is 30 cmH2O minus the pressure generated by 6 ml/kg of tidal&#xD;
      volume) and stops at 2 cmH2O less than the best PEEP (PEEPmin), identified according to the&#xD;
      static compliance value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time ultrasound linear probe is transversely set 1 cm above or below the EIT belt&#xD;
      and clips recorded at each PEEP level as described above (Fig.2). A total of 6 LUS clips for&#xD;
      each level of PEEP is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once best PEEP is identified, LUS clips are encoded stored on an external memory stick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EIT images&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound setting pre-defined are fixed. Clips are analyzed using GE software and&#xD;
      longitudinal speckle tracking applied for each pleural clip. A-lines are numbered per clip&#xD;
      Measurements Maximal strain, strain rate and time to peak are calculated and stored by a&#xD;
      second investigator blinded to respiratory maneuvers. Differences between parameters&#xD;
      calculated on basal and on PEEP trial clips are analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EIT session is analyzed by dedicated software and lung impedance assessed; each LUS clip is&#xD;
      matched with correspondent part of EIT image considered two Region of Interest on the upper&#xD;
      part of each hemithorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-observer variability on speckle-tracking is assessed by intra-class coefficient&#xD;
      correlation; correlation between speckle tracking values and PEEP level is assessed by&#xD;
      Spearman correlation test; receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Youden's index) is&#xD;
      calculated to predict the accuracy of speckle tracking for predicting hyperinflation. EIT and&#xD;
      LUS clips are compared with Cohen's K.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A-lines are numbered at different level of PEEP to investigate if the number of A-lines could&#xD;
      be related to lung overdistention&#xD;
