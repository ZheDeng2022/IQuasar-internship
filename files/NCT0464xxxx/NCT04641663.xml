    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to determine if a multi-ingredient dietary supplement is safe&#xD;
      and easy to take by healthy older adults. Participants will be required to take one of three&#xD;
      different doses of the dietary supplement for 90 consecutive days and complete wellness&#xD;
      surveys and a daily log while taking the supplement. Participants will also provide blood&#xD;
      samples at the start of the study, after 30 days, and at the end of the study which will help&#xD;
      determine how participants respond to the supplement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Likely because of the highly complex nature of aging, there has been little success reducing&#xD;
      age-related physical and cognitive deterioration. The predominant approach has been to manage&#xD;
      emergent symptoms rather than mitigate the cellular mechanisms driving the degenerative&#xD;
      processes underlying aging. Additionally, the multifaceted and complex etiology of aging&#xD;
      makes it extremely difficult to provide effective interventions within current treatment&#xD;
      paradigms. The medical community has established that preventative measures are the most&#xD;
      effective means of slowing the progression of age-associated deterioration, however effective&#xD;
      methods or interventions have not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multi-Target Dietary Supplement (MTDS) was designed to simultaneously target and support&#xD;
      the cellular processes implicated in the progression of the aging phenotype (oxidative&#xD;
      stress, inflammatory processes, insulin resistance, and membrane and mitochondrial&#xD;
      deterioration). The MTDS is unique in that it was specifically designed as a multi-target&#xD;
      intervention to support the complex cellular perturbations associated with aging. Components&#xD;
      of the formulation were chosen based on scientific consensus of documented effectiveness for&#xD;
      one or more of the targeted processes, long-term evidence of safety, and synergistic or&#xD;
      additive interactions between components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In more than 20 years of pre-clinical research, the MTDS has demonstrated significant&#xD;
      beneficial impacts in animal models of aging and age-associated disease. The MTDS has&#xD;
      resulted in significant reductions in both acute and chronic oxidative stress, greatly&#xD;
      improved mitochondrial function and efficiency, significantly reduced inflammatory processes&#xD;
      and improved glucose metabolism. Signal transduction is normalized to youthful levels in aged&#xD;
      animals, including key pathways implicated in aging (unpublished data). On a functional&#xD;
      level, MTDS treatment has resulted in increased longevity of 10 to 28% in normal and&#xD;
      accelerated aging phenotypes, respectively. Concomitant improvements in mobility, activity&#xD;
      levels, muscle strength (exercise mimetic) and overall body condition in aged animals were&#xD;
      observed. Dramatic reductions in the incidence of muscle wasting, arthritic processes, and&#xD;
      cataracts were also observed. Sensory and cognitive acuity were protected and frequently&#xD;
      enhanced in aged animals, with significant improvements in visual and olfactory function&#xD;
      observed in a broad range of tasks. MTDS treatment has demonstrated profound sparing from&#xD;
      age-related neuronal losses and corresponding protection of neurogenesis and enhanced&#xD;
      synaptogenesis, resulting in dramatically improved cognition in aged animals. The quantity of&#xD;
      data indicating MTDS efficacy in pre-clinical studies is considerable, however the effects of&#xD;
      the MTDS in humans, although positive, remains anecdotal. This tolerability study is the&#xD;
      critical first step to begin assessment of the efficacy of the MTDS in human populations. If&#xD;
      even a portion of these protective effects of the MTDS are translatable from mice to humans,&#xD;
      the positive impacts for the aging population and Ontario's healthcare system could be&#xD;
      profound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, three-arm study designed to evaluate the safety of a dietary&#xD;
      supplement at three dosing regimes for 90 days. Initially, 45 healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of three dose regimes: 1) 100% of recommended daily dose (RDD), 2)&#xD;
      80% of recommended daily dose or 3) 60% of recommended daily dose. Dosing regimes are based&#xD;
      on levels of the MORNING tablet doses, all groups will receive the full recommended dose for&#xD;
      both EVENING and OMEGA doses. Written informed consent will be obtained and a medical history&#xD;
      and health assessment will be performed. The investigator will determine whether the subject&#xD;
      meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Health assessments will be made at baseline, 30&#xD;
      days and 90 days. Adverse events, concomitant medications, and product administration will be&#xD;
      recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance, safety, and tolerability parameters are the primary focus of this study; however&#xD;
      the probability of serious adverse events is extremely low given the long safety history of&#xD;
      safety of the vitamins and nutraceuticals that comprise the MTDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the MTDS regimen in terms&#xD;
      of its administration at 3 dosing regimes for 90 consecutive days with respect to&#xD;
      micronutrient levels, laboratory tests and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. monitoring compliance of taking the MTDS,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. monitoring wellness as measured by the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) scale and daily&#xD;
           journal, over the 90-day administration of the MTDS, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to assess MTDS absorption through plasma micronutrient testing, at baseline, 30 days and&#xD;
           90 days following administration of the test agent.&#xD;

    <description>The SF-36 wellness questionnaire will be used to assess the health status of subjects. There are 36 individual questions which identify eight different facets of wellness. These have been described as physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. These facets are further collapsed into physical and mental component summaries. The eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. This questionnaire will be included in the study booklet given to each subject, and will be self administered.</description>
