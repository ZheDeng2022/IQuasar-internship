    <textblock>
      This study tests the effectiveness of parent and family oriented support interventions that&#xD;
      are designed to help with weight loss among African American families. Obesity tends to run&#xD;
      in families, thus family based interventions, with parents as main change agents have been&#xD;
      strongly recommended. The parent and family oriented support Interventions may help&#xD;
      facilitate weight loss among African American families.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether a parent/caregiver intervention or a family intervention can produce&#xD;
      greater weight loss among obese African American (AA) parents at 12 months compared to a&#xD;
      cancer prevention group (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) model,&#xD;
      to evaluate individual and church-level barriers and facilitators on program reach,&#xD;
      effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance and dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore whether a parent/caregiver intervention and a family intervention can produce&#xD;
      weight maintenance or weight loss, as determined by change in body mass index (BMI) z-score,&#xD;
      among AA children at risk for obesity at 12 months compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the extent to which the proposed interventions improve fruit and vegetable (FV)&#xD;
      consumption, physical activity, blood pressure, body fat percentage, muscle mass and waist&#xD;
      circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Churches are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Parents/caregivers whose churches are randomized to Group I, attend monthly health&#xD;
      coaching sessions over 1 hour each for 12 months, 9 resource navigation sessions over 12&#xD;
      months, and monthly support groups for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Families whose churches are randomized to Group II, attend monthly health coaching&#xD;
      sessions over 1 hour each for 12 months, 9 resource navigation sessions over 12 months, and&#xD;
      monthly support groups for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Families whose churches are randomized to Group III, receive an educational&#xD;
      handbook on cancer prevention.&#xD;
