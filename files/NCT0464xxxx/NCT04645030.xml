      Pneumonia is one of the most common infections in the emergency department (ED).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the current diagnostic tools are often slow and inaccurate. Currently, a chest&#xD;
      x-ray is the first choice for diagnostic imaging for pneumonia in the ED, but is inaccurate&#xD;
      with low sensitivity and specificity, resulting in both over-and underdiagnosing of&#xD;
      pneumonia. Alternatively, computer thermography (CT) and high-resolution CT (HR-CT) offers&#xD;
      high diagnostic accuracy but involves significantly increased radiation to the patient, and&#xD;
      increased costs and examination time. Lately, two alternatives to chest x-ray have emerged:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first is lung ultrasound (LUS) which has shown higher sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
           for pneumonia than a chest x-ray when performed by experts. However, the diagnostic&#xD;
           accuracy of lung ultrasound performed by novice operators in the ED still needs&#xD;
           investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second alternative to chest x-ray is ultra-low-dose CT (ULD-CT). A ULD-CT is a CT&#xD;
           scan where the radiation dose is significantly reduced, while still maintaining&#xD;
           acceptable image quality. In effect merging the high diagnostic accuracy of chest CT&#xD;
           with the low radiation doses of chest X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of LUS by novice operators in&#xD;
      the ED and the diagnostic accuracy of ULD-CT thorax, in patients suspected of having&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infectious diseases in the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED). In Denmark, the incidence of hospitalization is 809 per 100,000&#xD;
      and 30-day mortality is 13%. In 2018, 29.5 per 100.000 people died of pneumonia. An increase&#xD;
      from 27.7 per 100,000 in 2017. CAP is usually suspected in patients with dyspnea, cough and&#xD;
      fever, without other probable explanations or when other differential diagnosis is less&#xD;
      likely. However often patients present with vague and uncharacteristic symptoms such as&#xD;
      altered state of consciousness, gastrointestinal symptoms or pain. Likewise is fever not&#xD;
      always present in the elderly. The most common CAP pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae,&#xD;
      Haemophilus influenzae, and gram-negative bacilli. Other notable microbiological pathogens&#xD;
      include viruses such as Influenza, COVID-19, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus.&#xD;
      Viruses are associated with bacterial co-infections, leading to increase mortality and&#xD;
      complications such as admission to the ICU. Normally, when a pulmonary infection is&#xD;
      suspected, a chest X-ray is performed. Chest x-rays have a sensitivity of 43,5% (39,4-50,8)&#xD;
      and a specificity of 93% (92.1-93.9) for pulmonary opacities compared to CT. A chest x-ray&#xD;
      has a sensitivity of 79% for pneumonia. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax has&#xD;
      higher diagnostic precision and results improve management but result in a correspondingly&#xD;
      increased amount of radiation compared to chest X-ray. An ultra-low-dose CT (ULD-CT) scan of&#xD;
      the thorax may be an alternative to CT scan. ULD-CT has a radiation dose of approx. 1.5 times&#xD;
      greater than the radiation dose of a chest X-ray and approx. 1.5% of a CT scan. ULD-CT has&#xD;
      shown better image quality than chest X-ray, and for acutely admitted patients with dyspnea,&#xD;
      it has a clinical effect on both diagnosis and treatment. Like chest X-rays, basic findings&#xD;
      on ULD-CT of the thorax can be interpreted by trained clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound is a fast non-invasive diagnostic test, without radiation. LUS has high&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity, with the area under ROC (AUC) of 0.95-0.98 for pneumonia. A&#xD;
      meta-study for the use of LUS in the diagnosis of pneumonia in the ED has shown a sensitivity&#xD;
      of 92% (87-96%) and a specificity of 94% (87-97%). AUC was calculated at 0.97. The ultrasound&#xD;
      operators in the meta-study were all experienced ultrasound operators. Ultrasound is an&#xD;
      operator-dependent tool and in children, it has been demonstrated that LUS diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy for pneumonia, is significantly lower when performed by a novice sonographer&#xD;
      compared to an advanced sonographer. There are few if any studies that have investigated the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of novice LUS operator, in the ED, for pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study goals and objectives The project is divided into two, a ULD-CT study and an LUS study.&#xD;
      The study will aim to investigate their diagnostic capabilities in at emergency department&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the ULD-CT study is to investigate and answer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can ULD-CT be used to diagnose pneumonia in the emergency department?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How is the agreement between the results from ULD-CT and results from HR-CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is ULDCT more sensitive and specific than standard chest x-ray in the diagnosis of&#xD;
           pneumonia?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that ULD-CT can be used in the evaluation of patients with&#xD;
      pneumonia and the sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC ) of ULD-CT is&#xD;
      higher than a chest x-ray. The null-hypothesis is that ULD-CT is not an accurate diagnostic&#xD;
      tool for pneumonia in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the LUS study is to investigate and answer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can LUS be used to diagnose pneumonia in the emergency department, with newly certified&#xD;
           LUS operators?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How is the agreement between the results from LUS and the results from HR-CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is LUS more sensitive and specific than standard chest x-ray in the diagnosis of&#xD;
           pneumonia?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that LUS can be used in the evaluation of patients with&#xD;
      pneumonia by recently certified operators and the sensitivity, specificity and AUC of LUS is&#xD;
      higher than chest x-ray in an emergency department setting. The null-hypothesis is that LUS&#xD;
      performed by recently certified operators is not an accurate diagnostic tool for pneumonia in&#xD;
      the emergency department.&#xD;
