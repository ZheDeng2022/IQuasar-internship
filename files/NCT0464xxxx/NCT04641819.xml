  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nationwide, multicenter, randomized, prospective, real-world study. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of Yangzheng Compound Mixture in the&#xD;
      treatment of sleep disorder in cancer patients with Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome during&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is one of the most common symptoms in cancer patients, the morbidity is&#xD;
      about 60%. Drugs commonly used to treat sleep disorders include benzodiazepines, hypnotic&#xD;
      antidepressants and melatonin receptors agonists. The short-term efficacy of these drugs has&#xD;
      been proven in many clinical trials, but long-term medications bear the risk of adverse&#xD;
      reactions and addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yangzheng Compound Mixture is an extract of several traditional Chinese medicines, used as a&#xD;
      basic prescription for cancer therapy, especially for patients who received chemotherapy with&#xD;
      Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome, which often lead to sleep disturbance, fatigue and anorexia.&#xD;
      According to some clinical and basic studies, Yangzheng Compound Mixture also has antitumor&#xD;
      and immunomodulatory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, about 10 research centers will participate. We planned to enroll 1526 cancer&#xD;
      patients (1144 cases in the observation group and 382 cases in the control group) with Qi-Yin&#xD;
      deficiency Syndrome and sleep disorders during the period of receiving chemotherapy or&#xD;
      combination of chemotherapy. The dynamic random method was adopted in this study,&#xD;
      participants will be randomly divided into the experimental group (Yangzheng Compound Mixture&#xD;
      plus conventional treatment) and control group (conventional treatment only), all of them&#xD;
      will be interviewed once every 3 weeks until the end of the study.&#xD;
