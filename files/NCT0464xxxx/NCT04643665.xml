    <textblock>
      The thundering evolution of lung transplantation management during the past ten years and&#xD;
      primary graft dysfunction (PGD) new definition have led to new predictive factors of PGD.&#xD;
      Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed a monocentric database using a machine-learning&#xD;
      method, to determine the predictive factors of grade 3 PGD (PGD3), defined as a PaO2/FiO2&#xD;
      ratio &lt; 200 or being under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at postoperative day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We included all double lung transplantation from 2012 to 2019 and excluded multi-organ&#xD;
      transplant, cardiopulmonary bypass, or repeated transplantation during the study period for&#xD;
      the same patient. Recipient, donor and intraoperative data were added in a gradient boosting&#xD;
      algorithm step-by-step according to standard transplantation stages. Dataset will be split&#xD;
      randomly as 80% training set and 20% testing set. Relationship between predictive factors and&#xD;
      PGD3 will be represented as ShHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values.&#xD;

      The standardized anesthetic management has been previously described 18 and is detailed on&#xD;
      the web site http://anesthesie-foch.org/protocoles-anesthesie/ (&quot;The Foch lung transplant&#xD;
      anesthesia protocol&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables are presented as median + interquartile range (IQR) or mean and 95%CI,&#xD;
      and were compared using independent T-test or Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables are&#xD;
      presented as n (%) and were compared using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. We&#xD;
      applied machine learning algorithm to predict 3-day ahead primary graft dysfunction after&#xD;
      lung transplant surgery among patients. Machine learning is a branch of artificial&#xD;
      intelligence where computer systems can learn from available data and identify patterns with&#xD;
      minimal human intervention. Machine learning algorithm tests on data and performance metrics&#xD;
      were used to obtain the higher performing algorithm. In this study, we performed a XGBoost&#xD;
      (Gradient Boosting) algorithm which was a combination of decisions trees. Each decision tree&#xD;
      typically learned from its precursor and passed on the improved function to the following.&#xD;
      The weighted combination of these trees provided the prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No particular data transformation has been performed on numerical variables. Categorical&#xD;
      variables have been encoded as integer, without any further pre-processing steps. In&#xD;
      particular, no specific processing has been performed to deal with missing data. The default&#xD;
      behavior of XGBoost has been used. It consists in treating missing data as a specific&#xD;
      modality. During the training step of XGBoost models, missing values are treated as other&#xD;
      values, and left or right decisions at any branch of a tree are learned by optimizing the&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reflect the sequential nature of this predictive medicine problem, nine steps&#xD;
      have been defined to take into account incrementally observed variables acquired at various&#xD;
      stages of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: recipient variables Step 2: donor variables Step 3: arrival in the OR Step 4: after&#xD;
      anesthetic induction Step 5: during first pneumonectomy Step 6: after first graft&#xD;
      implantation Step 7: second pneumonectomy Step 8: second graft implantation Step 9: end&#xD;
      surgery status At each of the nine steps, a cross-validation procedure is employed to assess&#xD;
      the predictive performance of a machine learning model (XGBoost). One repetition of the&#xD;
      cross-validation procedure is designed as follows: the dataset of subjects is randomly split&#xD;
      into eight disjoint parts. Successively, the performance of the XGBoost model on each of the&#xD;
      eight subset,while training the machine learning model using the remaining seven subsets. For&#xD;
      such a repetition, the predictive probability of 3-day ahead primary graft dysfunction for&#xD;
      each subject is retained to finally compute the area under ROC (receiving operator curve). To&#xD;
      evaluate the variability of the predictive performance of the machine learning model, this&#xD;
      cross-validation procedure is repeated fifty times, with randomly chosen subjects partitions.&#xD;
      For each of the fifty times eight times nine (repetitions, partitions, surgical steps), hence&#xD;
      3600 models training, a conservative approach has been adopted for XGBoost training,&#xD;
      consisting in a unique set of training parameters. These parameters have been chosen to&#xD;
      prevent overfitting due to a relatively small number of subjects compared to the number of&#xD;
      variables, especially categorical variables, which yield a high degree of freedom.&#xD;
      Specifically XGBoost has been trained for 400 rounds (no early stopping), a maximum depth of&#xD;
      5 for each tree, a minimum child weight of 3, and a learning parameter eta equals to 0.0002.&#xD;
      Besides those conservative parameters chosen to prevent overfitting, only 40 percents of&#xD;
      available columns are selected for tree construction at each round, and 95 % of subjects.&#xD;
      These parameters have been kept fixed and chosen to ensure stability of results. Small&#xD;
      perturbations around these values could result in local performance improvements, but would&#xD;
      not be practically chosen given the size of the dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to gain some insights into the most useful variables in terms of predictive power,&#xD;
      we then conducted a post-hoc analysis based on the following methodology: at each surgical&#xD;
      step, 400 models have been trained for the repeated cross-validation procedure. For each&#xD;
      model, we retain the rank of each variable as given by the variable importance procedure of&#xD;
      XGBoost. The average rank of each variable for each step is then computed by averaging the&#xD;
      ranks obtained by variables for each of the 400 models. At step 9, variables are ordered&#xD;
      based on their average rank (increasing average ranks). They are then incrementally used as&#xD;
      input of a new cross-validation procedure (repeated 20 times).&#xD;
