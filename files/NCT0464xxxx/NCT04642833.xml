  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is considered the standard of care for patients with end-stage kidney&#xD;
      disease under chronic dialysis treatment. Today, modern surgical techniques have dramatically&#xD;
      improved the quality of life and the overall survival of renal transplant recipients (RTRs) .&#xD;
      Besides, the use of novel immunosuppressors have increased the 1-year graft survival rate and&#xD;
      decreased acute rejection rate . Unfortunately, several transplantation-related diseases&#xD;
      including cancer, cardiovascular disease and infection may affect the survival of renal&#xD;
      transplant recipients. It has been estimated that RTRs are 2- to 5- fold more likely to&#xD;
      develop cancer compared to the general population. Therefore, the development of cancer has&#xD;
      become a major concern as it is currently one of the main causes of death in RTRs. The&#xD;
      increasing incidence of post-transplant malignancies is generally attributed to&#xD;
      immunosuppression which leads to impaired immunosurveillance of cancer cells and virals&#xD;
      infections capable of cancer development. Additionally, it has been observed a direct and&#xD;
      specific pro-oncogenic effect on RTRs of immunosuppressive drugs and other&#xD;
      immunosuppression-independent factors such as the increased age of RTRs, the male gender and&#xD;
      the pre-transplant dialysis duration . Prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in&#xD;
      men and the most common non-skin solid neoplasm in RTRs. Generally, the vast majority of post&#xD;
      kidney transplantation prostate cancers are localised; however, due to the lack of randomized&#xD;
      studies, no specific guidelines for the management of localized prostate cancer are available&#xD;
      and, consequently, RTR patients are being treated with surgery or radiotherapy according to&#xD;
      national or local guidelines. The concomitant use of immunosuppressors and the presence of&#xD;
      the kidney graft in the pelvic cavity make the treatment of localised prostate cancer post&#xD;
      kidney transplantation more challenging, highlighting the need for these patients to be&#xD;
      addressed to urological oncology centres with surgeons familiar with oncological and&#xD;
      transplant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in men and the most common non-skin solid&#xD;
      neoplasm in RTRs, however, little studies describe the real incidence of prostate cancer in&#xD;
      RTRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to retrospectively review a 25-year experience at the Florence&#xD;
      Transplant Center in order to evaluate the incidence of prostate cancer and its possible&#xD;
      clinical/pathological factors able to influence the survival.&#xD;
