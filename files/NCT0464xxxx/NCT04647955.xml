  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fuctional dyspepsia is defined as the presence of symptoms thought to originate from the&#xD;
      gastroduodenum, in the absence of any structural or metabolic disease that is likely to&#xD;
      explain these symptoms. To facilitate its diagnostic and therapeutic approach, the Rome&#xD;
      consensus proposed to distinguish 2 subgroups: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS), is&#xD;
      characterized by meal-related symptoms such as early satiation and postprandial fullness. At&#xD;
      present, no validated instrument is available for the assessment of the symptom&#xD;
      responsiveness in patients suffering from PDS. To develop a new PRO questionnaire, we have&#xD;
      previously conducted focus group sessions and cognitive interviews in PDS patients to&#xD;
      identify all relevant symptom items that characterize PDS. In this study we aim to validate&#xD;
      the provisional Leuven Postprandial Distress Scale (LPDS) through the assessment of its&#xD;
      consistency, reliability and ability to detect change in the framework of a controlled&#xD;
      treatment trial.&#xD;
