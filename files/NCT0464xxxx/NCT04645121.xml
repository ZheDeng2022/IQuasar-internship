  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a case-control study with the primary aim of objectifying the volume status of&#xD;
      patients receiving hemodialysis. Volume status will be assessed at dry weight and evaluated&#xD;
      by a carbon monoxide rebreathing method, that measures blood volume, and bioimpedance that&#xD;
      measures total body water. Case-control subjects will be matched on gender, age and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to evaluate the carbon monoxide rebreathing method. Blood volumes obtained&#xD;
      by the carbon monoxide rebreathing method will be correlated to blood volumes obtained by&#xD;
      radioactive labelling of erythrocytes and albumin. In addition, it will be investigated&#xD;
      whether hemoglobin is a valid marker of anemia in patients receiving hemodialysis by&#xD;
      measuring the erythrocyte volume and the hemoglobin mass by the carbon monoxide rebreathing&#xD;
      method and correlating this to the hemoglobin concentration measured before and after&#xD;
      dialysis.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To combine a carbon monoxide rebreathing method and bioimpedance which allows to&#xD;
           objectively measure the amount of fluid in the bloodstream (intravascular) and&#xD;
           throughout the body, and thereby test the actual amount of fluid in the body when&#xD;
           patients are hydrated according to their clinical dry weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate carbon monoxide rebreathing method in hemodialysis patients compared against&#xD;
           a radioactive labeling of erythrocytes and albumin (the gold standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether hemoglobin is a valid marker of anemia in this patient population&#xD;
           by measuring the erythrocyte volume and hemoglobin mass by the carbon monoxide&#xD;
           rebreathing method and correlating this to the hemoglobin concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anemia and overhydration are challenging conditions in patients on hemodialysis.&#xD;
      Overhydration is associated with hypertension, cardiomyopathy and increased mortality. In&#xD;
      assessing the patient's volume status, blood pressure, body weight and peripheral edema are&#xD;
      used as indicators. To achieve a more accurate estimate, these measures have been combined&#xD;
      with various techniques, such as relative changes in blood volume (measured with blood volume&#xD;
      sensor (BVS)) and bioimpedance. These methods are used to varying degrees in everyday&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of overhydration, fluid is distributed intravascularly and can thereby expand blood&#xD;
      volume. The primary clinical problem with an expanded blood volume is hypertension and&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Measurement of the intravascular volume can&#xD;
      therefore have great clinical relevance, but currently there are no direct measures for this&#xD;
      implemented in the clinical daily routine. Various techniques have been used for research&#xD;
      purposes. These include fluorescent dilution techniques, radioactive labeling of erythrocytes&#xD;
      and albumin, as well as infusion of dialysate during dialysis where changes in BVS&#xD;
      measurements can be used to calculate the intravascular volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioimpedance can be used to measure the total water phase and the intra- and extracellular&#xD;
      volume. The method has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of overhydration in&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients. Overhydration detected by bioimpedance in hemodialysis patients has&#xD;
      been shown to correlate to increased mortality. Bioimpedance is a non-invasive, painless and&#xD;
      practically useful way of assessing the volume status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anemia is another significant challenge in patients on hemodialysis. The majority of patients&#xD;
      on hemodialysis have a significant decrease in endogenous erythropoietin production, which&#xD;
      causes anemia and requires treatment with an erythrocyte stimulant (ESA). The basis for&#xD;
      anemia diagnosis and the decision on ESA treatment in hemodialysis patients is based on&#xD;
      pre-dialysis hemoglobin (measured at dialysis start-up). Upon overhydration, fluid&#xD;
      distributed to the intravascular space will lead to dilated plasma volume (PV) and dilution&#xD;
      of hemoglobin. This dilution and thus artificial decrease in hemoglobin makes pre-dialysis&#xD;
      hemoglobin difficult to interpret in patients on dialysis. Time-averaged hemoglobin,&#xD;
      calculated on the basis of pre-dialysis and post-dialysis hemoglobin, has been shown to&#xD;
      correlate better with the actual hemoglobin of hemodialysis patients, but the value has not&#xD;
      gained ground in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The carbon monoxide rebreathing method is a well-proven technique for determining&#xD;
      intravascular volume, (blood volume, BV), PV and red blood cell volume (RBCV). In renally&#xD;
      healthy patients, the method is validated against a radioactive labeling technique (gold&#xD;
      standard) where high correlation (r = 0.97) has been demonstrated between the two methods.&#xD;
      The carbon monoxide rebreathing method has also been shown to be able to detect even very&#xD;
      small changes in blood volume. The method is safe and requires 6 minutes of carbon monoxide&#xD;
      inhalation. A prerequisite for using the carbon monoxide rebreathing method is a normal&#xD;
      diffusion of gas over the lungs, which allows uptake into the blood. Dialysis patients may be&#xD;
      significantly overhydrated and possible accumulation of water in the alveoli may decrease the&#xD;
      diffusion of carbon monoxide and affect the method. Against this background, the method is to&#xD;
      be validated against a radioactive labeling technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validity of the carbon monoxide rebreathing method in hemodialysis patients has not been&#xD;
      performed which is important if the method is to be implemented clinically and for research&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case-control study with 25 patients in each group. The case group consists of hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients and the control group consists of healthy individuals with eGFR above 60&#xD;
      ml/min/1.73m2. Subjects were matched on gender, age (+/- 5 years) and (weight +/- 10kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodialysis group: 25 hemodialysis patients are included. Immediately before the start of&#xD;
      dialysis, the total body water is measured by bioimpedance and blood samples are taken. A&#xD;
      normal hemodialysis lasts 3-4 hours and during this period the patient undergoes fluid&#xD;
      extraction corresponding to their estimated dry weight. 30 minutes after the dialysis is&#xD;
      completed, the total boby water is measured with bioimpedance and the blood volume, plasma&#xD;
      volume and erythrocyte volume are measured by carbon monoxide rebreathing method. In 10&#xD;
      participants, blood volume, plasma volume and the erythrocyte volume are measured by a&#xD;
      radioactive labeling of erythrocytes and albumin, where blood is taken at the beginning of&#xD;
      dialysis and cleaned at the end of dialysis. Hemoglobin and hematocrit are measured&#xD;
      pre-dialysis, post-dialysis and 30 minutes after cessation of dialysis. Participation in the&#xD;
      study involving the radioactive labeling of erythrocytes and albumin may be omitted if a&#xD;
      participant does not wish the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Includes 25 patients with eGFR above 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and without severe heart&#xD;
      failure, liver failure or lung disease. In all participants, the intravascular volume is&#xD;
      measured by carbon monoxide rebreathing method and the total body water by bioimpedance. In&#xD;
      10 participants, blood volume is measured by a radioactive label of erythrocytes and albumin.&#xD;
      Hemoglobin and other standard samples are measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant after inclusion must be withdrawn, the patient is replaced by a new&#xD;
      participant until a number of 25 participants in each group is achieved. If a matched&#xD;
      participant cannot be found for an included participant, the person in question is withdrawn&#xD;
      and replaced by a new one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood volume in patients hemodialysis has been found to be 73.4 ml / kg (SD 15 ml / kg) and&#xD;
      from the predicted normal blood volume has been found to be 59.0 ml / kg (SD 9.3 ml / kg). In&#xD;
      a two-sided unpaired t-test with α = 0.05, SD = 15 and a power of 90%, a sample size of 23&#xD;
      patients in each group will show a significant difference. A dropout rate of approximately 2&#xD;
      patients is assumed and a total of 25 are included in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study and data completion the results are analysed according to&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoints. Results are reported as mean values with confidence interval&#xD;
      or median and interquartile range. Data are analysed with parametric (normally distributed&#xD;
      data) or non-parametric statistics (non-normal distributed data). A 95 % confidence interval&#xD;
      is accepted as statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Analysis are performed as a per protocol&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
