  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) undergo complex critical care treatment&#xD;
      and are consequently surrounded by equipment and monitors contributing to high sound pressure&#xD;
      levels. In addition, many medical and nursing ICU staff members work together with numerous&#xD;
      visiting consultants resulting in an additional sound burden. As is already known, in the ICU&#xD;
      environment, many activities carried out by healthcare professionals, require a high level of&#xD;
      concentration. So, the noisy ICU environment causes interruptions in activities that require&#xD;
      concentration and induce in this way, a higher potential for errors. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set standards for sound&#xD;
      levels in hospitals with a recommendation for patient treatment areas. There is a clear trend&#xD;
      for increasing hospital noise since the sixties. According to healthcare professionals, one&#xD;
      of the strongest contributing factors of noise in the ICU environment are monitoring alarms&#xD;
      as they occur very frequently. Additionally, ICU nurses experience high levels of stress&#xD;
      towards clinical alarms and are becoming alarm fatigue, which means that the staff becomes&#xD;
      desensitized because of an excessive number of alarms and may disable or silence alarms&#xD;
      without checking the patient . Consensus dictates the importance of reducing sound pressure&#xD;
      levels and the numerous alarm signals from monitor alarms in the ICU. In the study, we focus&#xD;
      on busy predetermined areas in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the effect of an intervention bundle, aimed at the reduction of&#xD;
      &quot;noise&quot; (decibels) and its effect on health care professionals.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction is done by a stepped wedge cluster randomized design. The study will be&#xD;
      carried out in seven units of the department of intensive care medicine of the Radboud&#xD;
      University Medical Center, a 950-bed university hospital in the Netherlands. The study focus&#xD;
      on health care providers in the ICU.The research consists of the introduction of an&#xD;
      intervention bundle to reduce noise and therefore interruptions during their daily work&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All health care providers present at the ICU, during the study period (about 350) are asked&#xD;
      to participate. They will recieve information about the aim, content and relevance of the&#xD;
      study and will be asked for participation.They are free to refuse to participate in the study&#xD;
      (e.g. part of observations, survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection focuses on quantitative noise measurements at the predetermined locations&#xD;
      in ICU units during the study period. In addition, during the entire study period (control&#xD;
      and intervention), we analyse the amount and type of alarms. Thirdly, we collect data with&#xD;
      regard to disruptions during the daily work process of healthcare professionals (e.g. during&#xD;
      &quot;high-risk moments&quot;, such as: medication preparation) by observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, health care providers are asked about their perceived emotional impact e.g.&#xD;
      annoyance, as a result of ambient noise (questionaires). Items in the questionnaires are e.g:&#xD;
      degree of annoyance as a result of alarms, conversation, equipment, pagers/telefoons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be supported with the use of Phyton and MatLab.&#xD;
