    <description>After drug administration, subjects will be monitored for 3 hours, and pain intensity and safety data will be collected at various time points. Ibuprofen 600mg (or acetaminophen/codeine 650/60mg, if a contraindication for ibuprofen exists) will be provided in the 3-hour observation period as rescue medication if needed. Subjects will be encouraged to wait at least 60min after administration of the drug study before consuming the rescue medication. It will be given at the patient's request. If rescue medication was required, the study drug will still be dosed as per protocol, and time-to -rescue analysis will be performed. Then, the recommended root canal therapy will be performed the same or the next day.</description>
