  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the well-known detrimental effects of conventional cigarette smoking on oral health,&#xD;
      there are still lack of evidences about the impact of less harmful alternatives (such as&#xD;
      electronic cigarettes or heat not burn products), especially in young smokers with clinical&#xD;
      absence of signs of moderate to severe periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate whether cigarette smokers who switch to combustion-free&#xD;
      nicotine delivery systems (C-F NDS) undergo measurable improvements in oral health parameters&#xD;
      and teeth appearance, comparing short- and long-term impact on periodontal health between&#xD;
      smokers continuing with conventional cigarette smoking, those switching to combustion-free&#xD;
      nicotine delivery systems (C-F NDS), and never-smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator propose a prospective, multicenter, interventional, open label, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, three parallel-arms study assessing oral health parameters and teeth appearance&#xD;
      of 18 months duration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SMILE is an international, open label, randomized, controlled study of 18 months duration&#xD;
      designed to assess whether cigarette smokers switching to combustion free-nicotine delivery&#xD;
      systems (C-F NDS) will undergo measurable improvements in oral health parameters and teeth&#xD;
      appearance as a consequence of avoiding exposure to cigarette smoke. Five countries have so&#xD;
      far agreed to participate: Italy, Moldova, Poland, UK and Indonesia. An amendment will be&#xD;
      submitted to the REC once the final two countries are signed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A volunteer population of never-smokers and regular smokers of conventional cigarettes with a&#xD;
      clinical absence of signs of periodontitis will be recruited. Regular cigarette smokers will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:4 ratio either continuing to smoke commercially manufactured conventional&#xD;
      cigarettes (Study Arm A) or switching to C-F NDS (Study Arm B). Never Smokers will be&#xD;
      assigned to Arm C.The intended minimum number of participants in each arm by the end of the&#xD;
      study is 84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before randomization, all smokers will be reminded of the risks associated with smoking and&#xD;
      will be offered a free smoking cessation program according to standard local guidelines and&#xD;
      depending on the local availability of antismoking services. Those who decline the invitation&#xD;
      will be eligible for recruitment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smokers are free to voluntarily quit smoking/C-F NDS and/or withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will attend a total of seven clinics visits: Day -28 to Day -1 - Screening;&#xD;
      Day 0 - Enrollment and Randomization (Visit 0); Day 14 (+/-3 days) - Baseline Visit (Visit&#xD;
      1); Day 90 (+/-5 days) - Visit 2; Day 180 (+/-7 days) - Visit 3; Day 360 (+/-10 days) - Visit&#xD;
      4; Day 540 (+/-10 days) - Visit 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo screening within 28 days prior to Visit 0. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled and randomized on Visit 0. Baseline assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at Visit 1, 14 days after Visit 0. The overall duration of study participation for&#xD;
      each participant will be a maximum of 568 +/- 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization sequence will be computer generated, with an allocation ratio of 1:4 (Study&#xD;
      Arm A : Study Arm B; Smokers : N-C NDS users) to compensate for an estimated 25% success rate&#xD;
      (combined smoking abstinence rate + &gt;90% smoking reduction rate) in the long term. The&#xD;
      randomization scheme will be provided to clinical sites via a web-based application set up by&#xD;
      the CRO. The staff randomizing the participant will access the web-based application when the&#xD;
      participant is with them, entering their participant identification number, date of birth and&#xD;
      initials into the program. The allocation will be immediately provided by the&#xD;
      program/software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product use Regular smokers will continue to smoke their usual brand of conventional&#xD;
      cigarette until Baseline on Visit 1. After Visit 1, participants on both Arms A and B will be&#xD;
      asked to use only their assigned products ad libitum for the whole duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Arm A will continue smoking their own conventional cigarette brand, as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Arm B will have the option to try and choose among a selection of either&#xD;
      three e-liquids or three tobacco sticks (depending on the C-F NDS they have chosen). They&#xD;
      will also be trained and instructed on how to correctly use their chosen C-F NDS.&#xD;
      Participants wishing to use a heated tobacco device (HTD) will receive the number of tobacco&#xD;
      sticks per day corresponding to the number of cigarettes smoked per day at baseline.&#xD;
      Participants wishing to use a vaping product will receive one vaping kit and supply of&#xD;
      e-liquids of their choice enough to provide consumption in between supply visits (see Table&#xD;
      2); on average they will receive 4 x 10 ml refill containers per week. Free products will be&#xD;
      supplied at each subsequent visit throughout the whole duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Arm C will continue to not smoking or use any form of tobacco or&#xD;
      nicotine-containing products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective monitoring of cigarette consumption, C-F NDS use, and oral hygiene routine will&#xD;
      be carried out throughout the study with the tracker APP. Moreover, participants in Arm B&#xD;
      will be asked to return all empty, part-used, and unused consumables (tobacco sticks,&#xD;
      e-cigarette cartridges, e-liquid refill bottles) at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be a minimum of 18 years of age. This is based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The legal age to obtain tobacco products is 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of at least 10 natural anterior permanent teeth in total (cuspid to cuspid,&#xD;
           lower and upper jaw).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effects of abstaining from smoking by switching in smokers with clinical&#xD;
      absence of periodontitis, a population of both smokers who are intending to make the switch&#xD;
      to N-C NDS and never-smokers will be recruited. By the end of the study, it is estimated that&#xD;
      a high proportion (approx. 75%) of patients randomized in the Arm B of the study will not be&#xD;
      able to achieve success (defined as either complete smoking abstinence or as at least 90%&#xD;
      smoking reduction). To account for this, the C-F NDS population will be over sampled and a&#xD;
      1:4 randomization ratio scheme (i.e. for every patient randomized in the continue-to-smoke&#xD;
      population, four will be randomized in the C-F NDS population) will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will not be possible to blind participants to the intervention they will be receiving. It&#xD;
      will not be possible to blind trial staff when providing the interventions and collecting&#xD;
      data. However, data analyses will be conducted blind to Study Arms allocation. All other&#xD;
      trial staff who have access to outcome data will remain blinded until prespecified data&#xD;
      analyses will be completed.&#xD;
