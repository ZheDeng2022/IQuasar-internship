  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the preliminary efficacy of 3 combinations (Sym021+Sym022,&#xD;
      Sym021+Sym023 and Sym021+Sym023+irinotecan) in patients with biliary tract carcinoma by&#xD;
      assessing overall response rates (ORRs) per Investigator assessment using Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 The study will also evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability profile of the 3 combinations&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate safety and efficacy in patients with biliary tract tumors who have&#xD;
      progressed on one prior line of gemcitabine and platinum-based chemotherapy in the metastatic&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is set up as 2 sub-studies. Sub-study 1 is composed of 2 investigational&#xD;
      combination treatment arms (Sym021+Sym022 [Arm A] and Sym021+Sym023 [Arm B]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 2, is composed of one investigational combination treatment arm:&#xD;
      Sym021+Sym023+irinotecan. A safety lead-in phase is included to assess tolerability of the&#xD;
      combination. A Study Safety Team will review clinical and laboratory safety data and will&#xD;
      make decisions regarding the continued enrollment after the safety lead-in phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      August 2021 : Based upon results from a recent per protocol Interim Analysis (IA) it is has&#xD;
      been decided as of 3rd of August 2021 to stop further enrollment into Sub-study 1 Arm A&#xD;
      (Sym021+Sym022). Future patients will be allocated to either Sub-study 1 Arm B&#xD;
      (Sym021+Sym023) or Sub-study 2 (Sym021+Sym023+irinotecan).&#xD;
