  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-part Phase Ia study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics of single ascending doses of SYHA1805.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is divided into three parts: 1) The first part: Four Chinese healthy subjects will&#xD;
      be included in the pre-test group to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      after taking SYHA1805 tablets; 2) The second part: To evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic characteristics, several single ascending doses of&#xD;
      SYHA1805 tablets or matching placebo tablets will be randomly administered to 24 Chinese&#xD;
      healthy subjects under fasting condition; 3) The third part :To evaluate the food effect on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetic characteristics, a single dose SYHA1805 tablets will be administered to&#xD;
      12 Chinese healthy subjects under fed or fasted condition.&#xD;
