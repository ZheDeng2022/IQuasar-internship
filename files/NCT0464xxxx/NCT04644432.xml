  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the open-label INDIGO-study is to examine whether a first line individualized&#xD;
      treatment strategy based on DNA and RNA analyses from the patient's tumor is feasible.&#xD;
      Moreover, to involve the patient further in their treatment via patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      (PRO) measurements in a value-based healthcare setup with simultaneous analyses of the&#xD;
      financial costs of this strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are assigned into 4 treatment arms according to the results of their DNA and RNA&#xD;
      analyses. All patients receive electronic questionnaires regarding symptoms and side effects&#xD;
      weekly and questionnaires regarding quality of life monthly. Based on each patient's answers&#xD;
      of the questionnaires the patient receives advices in the app to reduce the symptoms and side&#xD;
      effects or the patient is instructed to contact the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis: Basing the choice of first-line treatment for DNA mutations and RNA profiles&#xD;
      in a heterogeneous patient population increases the overall response rate for the total&#xD;
      population to 30% compared to 10% for historical cohorts.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. If the primary disease was diagnosed more than 1 year ago, a fresh medium needle&#xD;
                  biopsy must be collected to confirm the diagnosis and tissue must be collected&#xD;
                  for DNA and RNA analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If a patient with inoperable relapse had a nephrectomy less than 1 year ago, and&#xD;
                  no tissue samples are stored in Dansk CancerBiobank, a fresh medium needle biopsy&#xD;
                  must be collected for DNA and RNA analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. In cases where metastatic disease was confirmed by biopsy more than 1 year ago&#xD;
                  without initiated treatment, the patient is offered a fresh medium needle biopsy,&#xD;
                  but this is not mandatory for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. If the patient had a nephrectomy using tissue from Dansk CancerBiobank and has&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. A medium needle biopsy is mainly taken from a metastasis, but biopsy from a renal&#xD;
                  tumour is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. A biopsy may not be taken from bones as it cannot be used for molecular analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. If the primary tumour is a proven clear cell RCC, but the biopsy from a&#xD;
                  metastasis shows non-cc RCC, the patient can be included in the study.&#xD;
