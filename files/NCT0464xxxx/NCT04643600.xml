  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate changes in certain locomotor parameters as early predictors of&#xD;
      disease in smokers who are prone to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;

      The research will include about 150 respondents aged 40-65, smokers and non-smokers, and will&#xD;
      be conducted at the Special Hospital for Medical Rehabilitation 'Daruvarske toplice'. All&#xD;
      patients will make spirometry and the Tiffeneau-Pinelli index (ratio of forced expiratory&#xD;
      volume in 1 second - FEV1 and forced vital capacity FVC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be maesured: body weight, height, BMI (body mass index), waist&#xD;
      circumference, pulse (cp), saturation (SpO2), blood pressure, respiratory index and thoracic&#xD;
      spine mobility index measured. The thickness of the skin fold will be measured on the abdomen&#xD;
      with a caliper and on the measuring device for the analysis of body mass composition - Gaia,&#xD;
      the percentage of muscle and fat tissue will be determined for each patient, as well as the&#xD;
      analysis of body mass composition. All patients will do a 6-minute walk test and the&#xD;
      patient's cardiorespiratory and muscular ability will be tested on a bicycle erogometer, the&#xD;
      values of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and pulse (cp) will be recorded and the patient's&#xD;
      fitness status determined. Each patient will estimate dyspnea intensity from 1 -10 before and&#xD;
      after a 6-minute walk test and before and after a bicycle ergometer according to the Borg's&#xD;
      dyspnea scale. The strength test of the the quadriceps muscle, will be measured in all&#xD;
      patients on the Biodex isokinetic device. Quadriceps strength testing will be performed on 2&#xD;
      occasions. On one occasion without medication, except those that the patient may take&#xD;
      permanently, and on the other 90 minutes after the patient takes 1 tbl of L - Arginine 500 mg&#xD;
      on mouth to an empty stomach ,in order to monitor the possible increase in quadriceps&#xD;
      strength. All patients who are smokers will have recorded : the age of onset of smoking, the&#xD;
      year of smoking experience and the average number of cigarettes smoked per day. All patients&#xD;
      will complete the CAT, IPAQ and DASS-21 questionnaire.&#xD;
