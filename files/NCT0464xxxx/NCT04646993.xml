  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WHITE study is a multicenter, multinational, investigators-initiated, observational,&#xD;
      prospective study conducted in a consecutive series of ambulatory patients who had completed&#xD;
      the recommended or practicable period of anticoagulation after a first-ever episode of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism (VTE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of the study is to evaluate the distribution of decisions and of the reasons&#xD;
      guiding the physician's decision on the modality to manage the secondary prevention of VTE in&#xD;
      patients treated for a first-ever episode of VTE, after the initial 3-12 months of&#xD;
      anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The WHITE study is an international, non-profit, multicenter, observational, prospective and&#xD;
      no profit study 3,200 subjects having experienced a first-ever episode of DVT of the lower&#xD;
      limbs and/or PE, receive anticoagulation therapy for a period as recommended by international&#xD;
      and/or local practice guidelines will be enrolled across all the countries participating to&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When this recommended period expires, the attending physician has to decide whether to&#xD;
      continue with anticoagulation, switch to anti-thrombotic of another class, or stop any&#xD;
      prophylactic pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the distribution of decisions and of&#xD;
      the reasons guiding the physician's decision on the modality to manage the secondary&#xD;
      prevention of VTE in patients treated for a first-ever episode of VTE, after the initial 3-12&#xD;
      months of anticoagulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is the collection of data during the follow-up: the frequency of&#xD;
      thromboembolic complications, of bleeding complications, or death from any cause.&#xD;
