      This is a proof of concept study involving a novel medical device, developed to investigate&#xD;
      the potential for detecting and localising coronary artery stenosis. A prototype device will&#xD;
      be used in the proposed clinical investigation. It is a stick-on patch containing sensors&#xD;
      which measure the sound produced at and the movement of, the chest surface by flowing blood&#xD;
      as it accelerates through the stenosis and becomes disturbed as it emerges downstream,&#xD;
      allowing the blockage to be detected and localised non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed clinical investigation will involve a small number of patients and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. The patients will be drawn from those attending The BartsHeart Centre for&#xD;
      suspected or diagnosed coronary artery disease and all clinical measurements will take place&#xD;
      at Barts Health Trust. The patch to be used in the proposed clinical investigation&#xD;
      incorporates commercially available sensors and will be tested by recording acoustic&#xD;
      signatures in healthy volunteers, then in patients undergoing coronary CT angiography at&#xD;
      Barts. Signals will be analysed initially by measuring their acoustic energy at various&#xD;
      frequencies and in later iterations, by a machine-learning algorithm. Results will be&#xD;
      validated against the CT angiography gold standard.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project is a trial of a novel device, in the form of a stick-on patch containing&#xD;
      miniature accelerometers and microphones, designed to detect sounds produced by disturbed&#xD;
      blood flow in stenosed coronary arteries. Initially, acoustic data will be collected from a&#xD;
      small group of healthy volunteers to confirm proof of concept. Recordings from the patch will&#xD;
      then be made on up to 100 patients who, having presented with chest pain to the Barts Heart&#xD;
      Clinic, are undergoing simultaneous CTa investigations to determine the presence or absence&#xD;
      of occlusive CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine if the nature of the signals recorded by the patch&#xD;
      makes it possible to distinguish those patients who have identifiable CAD, as detected by CTa&#xD;
      (the reference method) from those in whom no occlusive lesions can be seen in the CTa images.&#xD;
      The measurements on patients will be preceded by a trial on 20 healthy volunteers to&#xD;
      establish base line readings and to ensure the reliability of the patch and the associated&#xD;
      data acquisition system, in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. In Europe alone in&#xD;
      2014 the resulting cost of health care, and lost production was around €100 billion per year&#xD;
      (Nichols. M et al. 2014). Existing diagnostic methods apart from ECG require skilled&#xD;
      operators and expensive equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in cCTA make it possible to detect and localise occlusive lesions with high&#xD;
      accuracy and precision, whilst minimising the use of contrast media, albeit at the cost of&#xD;
      some exposure to ionising radiation. Of equal or greater concern is the fact that&#xD;
      approximately 2/3 of symptomatic patients are found, on investigation, to be occlusion-free&#xD;
      (Patel et al. 2010), representing a great waste of resources and thus a loss of productivity&#xD;
      for the healthcare system and the patients themselves, to say nothing of their distress on&#xD;
      facing a false positive diagnosis and the risks associated with contrast injection and&#xD;
      exposure to unnecessary ionising radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-invasive system proposed here would be applied to symptomatic patients with stable&#xD;
      chest pain attending a cardiac outpatient clinic with the intention of screening out the 2/3&#xD;
      mentioned above, resulting in large cost and time savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More generally, prevention of CAD, facilitated by routine screening in a primary care setting&#xD;
      would also have the potential to relieve the economy of a major burden. Thus, there is scope&#xD;
      for enormous life and cost saving in the early-days detection and mitigation of CHD. Apart&#xD;
      from the immediate cost savings the longer term benefits include, for example, more&#xD;
      appropriate allocation of imaging infrastructure, streamlining of patients in intermediate&#xD;
      risk categories who require a more refined risk stratification; a novel technology with&#xD;
      potential application to other near surface sites (e.g. carotid stenosis) and with potential&#xD;
      development for deep sites (e.g. femoral stenosis); a sensing device suited to the&#xD;
      localisation software being developed by co-workers arising from our previous EPSRC funding.&#xD;
      There is also the potential for a 'take home' diagnostic kit which can collect and report&#xD;
      data via domestic WiFi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current assessment of patients with symptoms of CAD who are referred to cardiac clinics is in&#xD;
      most cases recommendation for a non-invasive imaging test, followed, if positive, by invasive&#xD;
      coronary angiography. In 2010-2012 at Barts Health only 25% of coronary CT angiography scans&#xD;
      were followed by invasive confirmation of advanced disease or treatment with either coronary&#xD;
      angioplasty or bypass graft surgery (Villadsen et al. 2016). This was observed in a&#xD;
      population of patients &quot;appropriately referred&quot; to testing, according to current NICE&#xD;
      clinical guideline 95. www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG95.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This percentage is in keeping with a large US multicentre registry where around 65% of the&#xD;
      patients were found to be free of occlusive vascular disease following angiographic&#xD;
      investigation (Patel et al. 2010). This study also showed that, although some demographic and&#xD;
      clinical characteristics could be useful in determining the likelihood of obstructive&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, the incremental value of non-invasive tests (resting ECG,&#xD;
      echocardiography, imaging stress tests and coronary CT angiography) was limited. The&#xD;
      implications are two-fold: whilst clinical assessment alone is insufficient to diagnose or&#xD;
      exclude the presence of disease, imaging tests have an exceedingly low diagnostic yield. It&#xD;
      was estimated that the volume of unnecessary non-invasive tests performed in the US in the&#xD;
      decade between 2000 and 2010 cost the US economy more than $500m (Ladapo, Blecker, and&#xD;
      Douglas 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite impressive technological advances in medical imaging equipment introduced over the&#xD;
      last years, translating into better accuracy and precision, we are witnessing a paradoxical&#xD;
      increase in the number of imaging tests performed per year, which also includes multiple&#xD;
      testing in the same patient (Andrus and Welch 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the financial pressure on the healthcare system, large numbers of unnecessary imaging&#xD;
      tests are unsustainable, as are the productivity losses related to hospital visits, the risks&#xD;
      of false positive findings, and unnecessary referrals to invasive procedures which expose&#xD;
      patients to the risk of complications (e.g. bleeding, contrast induced nephropathy, stroke,&#xD;
      repeat radiation exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a non-invasive system to pre-screen symptomatic patients attending a cardiac&#xD;
      outpatients' clinic. This approach is aimed at supporting a more appropriate use of imaging&#xD;
      resources, refining the identification of patients requiring an imaging test and/or an&#xD;
      invasive procedure, reducing the number of unnecessary imaging tests and angiographic&#xD;
      investigations, resulting in large cost and time savings.&#xD;
