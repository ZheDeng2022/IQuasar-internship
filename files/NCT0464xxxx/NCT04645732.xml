    <textblock>
      Chronic conditions such as knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA), chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD), heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and depression are among the leading causes of global disability and&#xD;
      affect hundreds of millions of people around the world. In recent years, multimorbidity,&#xD;
      commonly defined as the co-occurrence of at least two chronic conditions, has also gained&#xD;
      interest due to its substantial impact on the person and society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the significant burden of multimorbidity, little is known about how to treat this&#xD;
      effectively. A 2016 Cochrane systematic review found that interventions targeting populations&#xD;
      with specific combinations of conditions and addressing specific problems such as functional&#xD;
      difficulties may be more effective. Exercise therapy is a treatment addressing functional&#xD;
      limitations that is a safe and effective treatment of at least 26 chronic conditions,&#xD;
      including OA, HF, CHD, hypertension, T2DM, COPD and depression. Furthermore, self-management&#xD;
      support is increasingly recognized as an essential component of interventions to improve&#xD;
      outcomes in patients living with multimorbidity and to support the long-term adherence to&#xD;
      exercise. A new systematic review found that exercise seems effective in people with&#xD;
      multimorbidity (the conditions included in the current study), however highlighting the need&#xD;
      for further high-quality RCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the effects of a&#xD;
      personalized exercise therapy and self-management support program in addition to usual care&#xD;
      on self-reported, objectively measured and physiological outcomes in people with&#xD;
      multimorbidity (i.e. at least two of the following conditions: OA (knee or hip), heart&#xD;
      condition (HF or CHD), hypertension, T2DM, COPD and depression). The primary endpoint is 12&#xD;
      months, but 12-week and 6-month follow-ups are included as well and a 12-month health&#xD;
      economic evaluation of the program will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the RCT, a feasibility trial of 20 people with multimorbidity, all undergoing the&#xD;
      personalized exercise therapy and self-management support program, will be conducted using&#xD;
      the same methods as in the RCT, but primarily focusing on feasibility outcomes (recruitment,&#xD;
      retention, adherence to treatment, burden of outcomes, improvements in outcomes, adverse&#xD;
      events). This will start recruitment in Feb 2021 and end August 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MOBILIZE project has received funding from several foundations, including the European&#xD;
      Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic conditions such as knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA), chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD), heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and depression are among the leading causes of global disability and&#xD;
      affect hundreds of millions of people around the world. In recent years, multimorbidity,&#xD;
      commonly defined as the co-occurrence of at least two chronic conditions, has also gained&#xD;
      interest due to its substantial impact on the person and society. In general, multimorbidity&#xD;
      affects more than half of all people with chronic conditions. Two out of three people with OA&#xD;
      have comorbidities, with HF, CHD, hypertension, T2DM, COPD and depression being some of the&#xD;
      most common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with multimorbidity account for 78% of all consultations in primary care and&#xD;
      multimorbidity is associated with poorer function and quality of life, depression, intake of&#xD;
      multiple drugs and increased health care utilization, with some studies demonstrating an&#xD;
      almost exponential relationship between the number of chronic conditions and their health&#xD;
      care costs. Furthermore, we know from qualitative research that treating one condition at a&#xD;
      time is inconvenient, inefficient and unsatisfactory for the person with the chronic&#xD;
      conditions and his or her health care provider. Most research so far has excluded people with&#xD;
      multimorbidity, due to its focus on only one specific condition, and most of the health care&#xD;
      sector manages each individual condition on its own instead of the person, highlighting the&#xD;
      negative impact of the current disease-based curative models on multimorbidity. With a&#xD;
      population that is ageing, and a significant number of people with multimorbidity being&#xD;
      younger than 65 years of age, the proportion of people with multimorbidity is increasing&#xD;
      rapidly, emphasizing the need to take action to deal with the increasing burden of chronic&#xD;
      conditions and multimorbidity through treatment and prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying and developing effective and affordable treatment strategies to deal with the&#xD;
      global burden of chronic conditions and multimorbidity is a major focus of modern health care&#xD;
      around the world. Despite the significant burden of multimorbidity, little is known about how&#xD;
      to treat this effectively. A 2016 Cochrane systematic review found that interventions&#xD;
      targeting populations with specific combinations of conditions and addressing specific&#xD;
      problems such as functional difficulties may be more effective. A treatment addressing&#xD;
      functional limitations that is able to improve symptoms in at least 26 chronic conditions,&#xD;
      including OA, HF, CHD, hypertension, T2DM, COPD and depression is readily available. This&#xD;
      treatment is exercise therapy, which is effective, safe and supported by substantial evidence&#xD;
      in patients with knee and hip OA, HF and CHD, hypertension, T2DM, COPD, depression and a&#xD;
      range of other chronic conditions. A new systematic review found that exercise seems&#xD;
      effective in people with multimorbidity (the conditions included in the current study),&#xD;
      however highlighting the need for further high-quality RCTs. Furthermore, self-management&#xD;
      support is increasingly recognized as an essential component of interventions to improve&#xD;
      outcomes in patients living with multimorbidity. There is increasing evidence that effective&#xD;
      management of multimorbidity requires the active participation by patients in the care&#xD;
      process. Self-management support interventions have been shown to change health behaviors,&#xD;
      improve health status, and reduce health care utilization and costs. Self-management support&#xD;
      is centered on enabling patients to develop a set of behavioral skills and abilities to help&#xD;
      them navigate a range of disease management tasks across different chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an RCT of people with knee OA, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, we found&#xD;
      that 3 out of 4 patients eligible for total knee replacement improved enough from&#xD;
      self-management support, supervised exercise therapy and other non-surgical treatments to&#xD;
      postpone surgery for at least one year. Furthermore, in patients with T2DM, 56% did not take&#xD;
      antidiabetic medication after 1 year of supervised exercise therapy, self-management support&#xD;
      and diet. Together, these studies indicate the potential of combining exercise,&#xD;
      self-management and other treatments to reduce the need for surgery and medication. A recent&#xD;
      cohort study found that an eight-week exercise and self-management program demonstrated&#xD;
      similar improvements in health outcomes for people with OA and the comorbidities included in&#xD;
      the current study as for people without comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altogether, this highlights exercise therapy and self-management support as viable treatment&#xD;
      options for people with multimorbidity, but the evidence supporting this is of low quality&#xD;
      and more high-quality RCTs are needed to improve care for the millions of people suffering&#xD;
      from multimorbidity worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the MOBILIZE project is to empower patients with multimorbidity to take a&#xD;
      more active role in their health care through a personalized exercise therapy and&#xD;
      self-management support program so that they may reduce symptoms of the individual&#xD;
      conditions, increase quality of life and physical function and prevent development of other&#xD;
      chronic conditions. To ensure relevance to the patients and the health care system and to&#xD;
      make sure that the project is implementable in clinical practice afterwards, strong&#xD;
      interdisciplinary collaboration involving many different scientific methodologies and a high&#xD;
      degree of patient involvement throughout the entire research process are at the heart of the&#xD;
      project. The MOBILIZE project has received funding from several foundations, including the&#xD;
      European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and&#xD;
      innovation program (grant agreement No 801790). Building on the Medical Research Council's&#xD;
      framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions, the MOBILIZE project&#xD;
      has four phases. During the first phase of the project, outcomes and biomarkers that predict&#xD;
      better health outcome from different types of exercise therapy and exercise characteristics&#xD;
      associated with a better outcome in people with different combinations of chronic conditions&#xD;
      will be identified through exploratory observational cohort studies of people with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis who have undergone an 8-week exercise therapy and education program in Denmark&#xD;
      (GLA:D) as well as scoping reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses that summarize the&#xD;
      existing evidence. Subsequently, in phase 2, a 12-week exercise therapy and self-management&#xD;
      support program will be developed based on existing recommendations for exercise and&#xD;
      strategies to facilitate behavioral changes. To ensure a high degree of patient and provider&#xD;
      involvement, focus group interviews will be conducted with patients with multimorbidity,&#xD;
      health care providers and other relevant stakeholders to acquire their views and perspectives&#xD;
      on multimorbidity and exercise. Once this phase is completed, the exercise therapy and&#xD;
      self-management support program will be tested in a feasibility trial involving 20 patients&#xD;
      with multimorbidity (recruited from Feb 2021 and onwards). The same procedures and outcomes&#xD;
      as in the subsequent RCT will be used, and data will be collected at baseline and immediately&#xD;
      after the intervention (12 weeks). The feasibility trial will primarily focus on feasibility&#xD;
      outcomes (recruitment, retention, adherence to treatment, burden of outcomes, improvements in&#xD;
      outcomes, adverse events), using a red/amber/green traffic light system, guiding the&#xD;
      progression to the subsequent RCT. Experiences from the feasibility trial will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate and implement any adjustments that need to be made prior to commencing the RCT&#xD;
      (described in details in the current trial registration). The RCT corresponds to phase 3,&#xD;
      while phase 4 focuses on developing a model for implementation of the personalized exercise&#xD;
      therapy and self-management support program in clinical practice, if supported by the study&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the RCT described in this clinical trial registration is to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of a personalized exercise therapy and self-management support program in addition to&#xD;
      usual care on self-reported, objectively measured and physiological outcomes in people with&#xD;
      multimorbidity (i.e. at least two of the following conditions: OA (knee or hip), heart&#xD;
      condition (HF or CHD), hypertension, T2DM, COPD and depression). The primary endpoint is 12&#xD;
      months, but 12-week and 6-month follow-ups are included as well and a 12-month health&#xD;
      economic evaluation of the program will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypothesis is that a personalized exercise therapy and self-management&#xD;
      support program in addition to usual care will improve quality of life more than usual care&#xD;
      alone when measured at 12 months with concurrent positive effects on secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the program will be cost-effective at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who only fulfill some of the eligibility criteria (at least 18 years old, at least two&#xD;
      of the relevant conditions and do not have an unstable health condition or are at risk of&#xD;
      serious adverse events as evaluated by a medical specialist and do not have psychosis&#xD;
      disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, attention deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder, autism, anorexia nervosa/bulimia nervosa or an abuse) and people&#xD;
      fulfilling all eligibility criteria, but are unwilling to participate in the RCT, will be&#xD;
      offered participation in an observational cohort study where only the self-reported outcomes&#xD;
      are completed. Recruitment for the cohort will start and end with the recruitment for the&#xD;
      RCT.&#xD;
