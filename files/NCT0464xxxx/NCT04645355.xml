    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm open-label study to evaluate the clinical and immunogenetic responses of&#xD;
      patients with plaque or guttate psoriasis to treatment with guselkumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guselkumab (TremfyaÂ®), an IL-23 inhibitor approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      plaque psoriasis. Given the potential role of IL-23 in the pathogenesis of guttate psoriasis,&#xD;
      guselkumab may be an effective option to treat the initial manifestation of guttate&#xD;
      psoriasis. This is a two-arm open-label study to evaluate the clinical and immunogenetic&#xD;
      responses of patients with plaque or guttate psoriasis to treatment with guselkumab. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to assess how treatment with guselkumab changes the immune&#xD;
      milieu of the skin in patients with plaque or guttate psoriasis. The secondary objectives of&#xD;
      this study are to assess how treatment with guselkumab affects the quality of life and extent&#xD;
      of skin disease in patients with plaque or guttate psoriasis.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single center, open-label study. Twenty-five subjects are planned (15 with new-onset guttate psoriasis and 10 with chronic plaque psoriasis). Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. All subjects will initially be treated with guselkumab 100 mg SQ at weeks 0, 4, and then every 8 weeks thereafter until week 44.</intervention_model_description>
