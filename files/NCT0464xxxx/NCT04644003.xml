    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamics, as well as exploratory efficacy of STP1, in a subgroup of patients with&#xD;
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).&#xD;

      After obtaining written informed consent, those patients who are deemed eligible for the&#xD;
      study, will be randomized on Day 1, in a double-blinded manner, in a 3:1ratio to receive&#xD;
      either oral STP1 (twice daily) or placebo (twice daily). The total study duration is 6 weeks,&#xD;
      including a screening phase of up to 2 weeks, a treatment phase of 2 weeks and a&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up phase of 2 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>OACIS: Ohio Autism Clinical Impression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The OACIS is composed of two scales: the OACIS-Severity scale (OACIS-S), which measures global severity of illness at a given point in time as well as scores for 9 anchors: social interactions; aberrant/abnormal behaviors; repetitive/ritualistic behaviors; verbal communication; non-verbal communication; hyperactivity/inattention; anxiety/fears; sensory sensitivities; restricted and narrow interests and the OACIS improvement scale (OACIS-C), which permits a global evaluation by the clinician of the subject's improvement over time. The OACIS-S is a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (very severe). The OACIS-C is a seven-point scale, ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>

    <measure>CGI-S: Clinical Global Impressions-Severity reflected by the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Illness severity rating is made on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being &quot;normal not at all mentally ill&quot; and 7 being &quot;among the most extremely ill patients&quot;. Subsequently, the patient's condition on the study drug (or placebo) is compared to the patient's condition before the initiation of the study drug (or placebo) (baseline) via additional CGI-S ratings or the CGI-I item. The CGI is a clinician-rated scale utilizing history from the caregiver and incorporating it into a clinical rating. The CGI-I will be used to judge the change in clinical impression as 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment</description>
