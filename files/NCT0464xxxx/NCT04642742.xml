  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effectiveness of a twice daily plant sterol&#xD;
      supplement, which is in a gummy format and packaged with health insights, in reducing LDL-C&#xD;
      cholesterol in a real word setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the safety and benefits of plant sterol supplements have been established and are&#xD;
      incorporated into many lipid lowering guidelines, there have been few prior studies of plant&#xD;
      sterol chewables in gummy format among real world subjects. In this study, we aim to measure&#xD;
      the LDL-C reducing impact of regular plant sterol supplementation in a real world setting.&#xD;
