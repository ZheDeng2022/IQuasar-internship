  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary approach that aims to increase fasting time and&#xD;
      decrease the eating window. Promising TRE effects on weight loss and some cardiometabolic&#xD;
      risk factors have been reported. However, there is a lack of randomized clinical trials that&#xD;
      directly investigate the effect of TRE at different times of the day (early vs. delayed) in&#xD;
      individuals with overweight and obesity. The present study investigates the effects of 8&#xD;
      weeks of TRE performed at different moments of the day on body composition and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic parameters in adults with overweight and obesity.&#xD;
