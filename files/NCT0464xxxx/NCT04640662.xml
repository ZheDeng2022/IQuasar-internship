  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tendinopathy is the common cause of shoulder pain in the working-age group and&#xD;
      the elderly (1). The condition reported takes an average of 10 months or longer to recover.&#xD;
      Treatment ranges from non-surgical therapy through exercise, physiotherapy, injections to&#xD;
      surgery (2). Injection of steroid was used in many cases to reduce pain. However, steroid&#xD;
      only provided short term pain relief and did not resolve the main pathology. Emerging of&#xD;
      biologics agents such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and prolotherapy are alternative to the&#xD;
      treatment (3). PRP is a concentrated platelet which contains a high concentration of protein&#xD;
      that helps in the healing process (4). Prolotherapy with the commonly used substance dextrose&#xD;
      works by attracting inflammatory substrate and stimulate own body healing process (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study takes place at the University of Malaya Medical Centre. Participants diagnosed&#xD;
      with rotator cuff tendinopathy are randomly divided into two groups- Platelet Rich Plasma&#xD;
      (PRP) group and Prolotherapy group. All participants are screened by the researcher for the&#xD;
      eligibility to join the study. Subsequently, the participants undergo baseline assessment on&#xD;
      the clinical, functional, biomechanics and ultrasound. Blood is taken in all patient, to make&#xD;
      the patient blind to the intervention they received. In the PRP group- the participants&#xD;
      received 2ml of PRP, and in prolotherapy group, the participants received 2ml of 16.5%&#xD;
      dextrose solution. A single injection is done by an experienced Sports Physician using&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided into the injured area. The assessor at baseline, and follow up are blinded&#xD;
      to the intervention. The participants need to come for follow up at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic reviews showed the benefit of biologics agent to treat tendon injuries, especially&#xD;
      for lateral epicondylitis and patellar tendinitis (6). Many studies for soft tissue injury&#xD;
      were on PRP compared to prolotherapy. This study hypothesized that both treatments result in&#xD;
      significant improvement in pain and function after the intervention. PRP might provide more&#xD;
      significant improvement compared to prolotherapy.&#xD;

      Study design This study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial conducted at the&#xD;
      University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients The patients will be recruited from the following clinics: Sports Medicine,&#xD;
      orthopaedic, rheumatology, outpatient and staff health. Notice of study invitation in this&#xD;
      study will be distributed to all the respective clinic. Patients with a confirm diagnosis of&#xD;
      supraspinatus tendinopathy by ultrasound or MRI will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
      Study screening will be carried out to ensure the inclusion and exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      fulfilled by the research team in Sports Medicine Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP group Patients under PRP group will receive a single 2 mL injection of PRP into the&#xD;
      injury site under ultrasound guidance administered by a sports physician. The PRP will be&#xD;
      prepared using a commercial kit, Y-Cell BioKit Systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolotherapy group Patients in the prolotherapy group will receive a single 2 mL injection of&#xD;
      16.5% dextrose solution administered under ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection technique Injection will be performed in the Sports Medicine Clinic using aseptic&#xD;
      technique. Both the PRP and prolotherapy will be prepared in a syringe and covered with a&#xD;
      black tape to ensure the patients did not know the content of the syringe. Patients will be&#xD;
      placed in the supine position and will be requested not to turn their head during the&#xD;
      procedure. A 22 G needle will be used for injection under ultrasound guided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following injection, cryotherapy will be applied for 15 min. Upon discharge, patients will be&#xD;
      advised to rest the injected shoulder for the next 48 hours and to avoid taking NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation program Patients will receive a booklet for shoulder stretching and&#xD;
      strengthening exercise. A logbook will be provided for the patients to record their exercise&#xD;
      session. Rehabilitation sessions will be advise to commenced only day three of injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size was estimated based on the primary outcome of functional score.&#xD;
      Improvement was defined by a decrease in the mean Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)&#xD;
      of 17.7 ± 3.7 in the platelet-rich plasma group11 and 16.12 ± 12.8211 for prolotherapy. For&#xD;
      this study, the sample size was calculated after taking into account the desired statistical&#xD;
      significance level set at 5%, and the power of the study set at 80%, with type I error rate&#xD;
      of less than 0.05 is permitted and a false-negative rate of less than 0.20. The sample size&#xD;
      is calculated using the G*Power version 3.1.9.2 software11. With the assumption of 30% drop&#xD;
      out, hence, to detect a difference in the functional outcome, a minimum of 30 patients in&#xD;
      each group is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will be performed using computer-generated block randomization of&#xD;
      ten. Subjects will be randomized into either PRP group or Prolo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The patients and assessors will be blind to the intervention. Two sports physician&#xD;
      who not directly involved in the randomization and injection will perform the outcome measure&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients characteristics Patients sociodemographic information, including gender, date of&#xD;
      birth, ethnic background, job description and recreational activities will be recorded.&#xD;
      Information related to the shoulder pain such as duration and other past rehabilitation and&#xD;
      treatment will also be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures The primary outcome of this study is pain score using the visual&#xD;
      analog score (VAS) score and shoulder function using shoulder pain and disability index&#xD;
      (SPADI) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS score (7) is a continuous scale, 10 cm length with the left most anchor indicate &quot;no&#xD;
      pain&quot; (0) to &quot;extreme pain&quot; (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPADI was used to measure shoulder pain and disability in an outpatient setting within the&#xD;
      recent 1 week. It contains 13 items that assess pain and disability. SPADI reveals good&#xD;
      construct validity, correlating well with other specific shoulder questionnaires and&#xD;
      responsive to change over time (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Constant-Murley score assessed four aspects of shoulder injury which consist of two&#xD;
           subjective item- pain and activities of daily living (ADL) and two objective item- range&#xD;
           of motion (ROM) and strength. This score was used in many shoulder studies and had good&#xD;
           response to change quality (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical test which consist of special test&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biomedical test which consist of shoulder ROM using goniometer, strength using&#xD;
           dynamometer and periscapular muscle activities using electromyogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adverse effect of the injections will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management Data will be collected from patients at baseline, 3 weeks, 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months and 6 months. All data collected will be stored securely in a locked cabinet&#xD;
      in Sports Medicine Department throughout the trial and only can be access by the researcher&#xD;
      involved. To ensure confidentiality, each patient will have the trial identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The outcome variables will be analyzed with the principle of&#xD;
      intention-to-treat (ITT). The mean VAS score and SPADI between groups will be compared using&#xD;
      either the parametric independent t-test or non-parametric test using Mann-Whitney U test.&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures will be examine using linear mixed- model analysis. All&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS V.25.0 (SPSS), and a p value of &lt;0.05&#xD;
      will be considered to be significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      the University of Malaya Medical Centre (MREC ID: 201977-7623). This trial was registered at&#xD;
      the National Medical Research Register (NMRR-19-1658-48279). Participation in this study is&#xD;
      strictly voluntary. Possible patients will be informed of all the procedures involved in the&#xD;
      reserach verbally and by the patient's information sheets. Patients will be required to sign&#xD;
      the informed consent form before participation. Patient will be allowed to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any time. Results from this study will be presented at scientific conferences and&#xD;
      publish in journal.&#xD;
