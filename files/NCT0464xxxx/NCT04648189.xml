  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter single arm phase II trial. 40 patients with pathology proven stage I-IIIA NSCLC&#xD;
      that are eligible for resection will be enrolled in this study. All patients will receive one&#xD;
      dose of cetuximab prior to surgery. Blood will be drawn on multiple timepoints to assess te&#xD;
      amount of circulating tumor cells&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a single neoadjuvant dose of cetuximab (anti-EGFR mAb) - administered 72 to 48 hours prior to surgery - will reduce the number of CTCs in patients. The reduction of CTCs will be expressed in percentage as more or less than 50% changed from baseline.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of surgically resectable NSCLC, stage I-IIIA, with curative intent surgery&#xD;
             planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  â‰¥10 EGFR+EpCAM+ cells detected in the baseline blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test performed within 7&#xD;
             days of the start of treatment. Both men and women enrolled in this trial must agree&#xD;
             to use adequate barrier birth control measures (e.g., cervical cap, condom, and&#xD;
             diaphragm) during the course of the trial. Oral birth control methods alone will not&#xD;
             be considered adequate on this study, because of the potential pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interaction between study drug and oral contraceptives. Concomitant use of oral and&#xD;
             barrier contraceptives is advised. Contraception is necessary for at least 6 months&#xD;
             after receiving study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy or other anti-cancer therapy including radiotherapy during the study or&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior anti-EGFR mAb therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other currently active malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppressive drugs during the study or within 4 weeks prior to the start of te&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected adverse reactions/allergies or study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mental disorder/unable to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant skin condition interfering with treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 28 days before start of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with&#xD;
             the subject's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of the subject and their&#xD;
             compliance in the study.&#xD;
