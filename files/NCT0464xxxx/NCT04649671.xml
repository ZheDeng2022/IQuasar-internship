  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is predicted to have positive effect among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC). However, little attention has been paid to the role of physical activity with wearable&#xD;
      device in the management of HCC patients in the aspect of improvement in insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We designed this study to investigate whether personalized exercise with mobile health&#xD;
      program improves insulin resistance without decompensation in HCC patients with insulin&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
