  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting are common occurrences following bariatric surgery,&#xD;
      occurring in up to 80% of patients and contributing to increased healthcare utilization and&#xD;
      delays in discharge. This study aims to evaluate the impact of a high-protein liquid diet on&#xD;
      postoperative nausea, vomiting, and length of stay after laparoscopic or robotic sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Patients with obesity or morbid obesity who are scheduled to undergoing robotic or&#xD;
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy will be screened at their preoperative visit. If they meet&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be invited to participate in the study and written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained. If the patient consents to participation, they will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the control arm or intervention arm. All patients will undergo sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy in a standard fashion, either laparoscopically or robotically, as discussed with&#xD;
      their bariatric surgeon. Post-operative diet will be initiated 4 hours after surgery. The&#xD;
      specific diet received will depend on which arm the patient is randomized into.&#xD;
      Post-operative assessments will be completed at various time points for all patients. These&#xD;
      include a Verbal Rating Scale of Nausea and Vomiting, Rhodes Index Survey, and Quality of&#xD;
      Recover-15 Survey. All patients will track their oral intake on a spreadsheet which will be&#xD;
      provided. Additional demographic and clinical data will be collected from the Electronic&#xD;
      Medical Record. After hospital discharge, patients will follow up in the clinic one week and&#xD;
      one month after surgery, per routine. After the one-month visit, the patient's study&#xD;
      participation will be considered complete.&#xD;
