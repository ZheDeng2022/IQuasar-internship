  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  In terminally ill cancer patients, palliative sedation has been applied to intractable&#xD;
           refractory symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, delirium, agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palliative sedation is generally an adaptive strategies using midazolam, which is&#xD;
           composed of intermittent bolus, limited continuous, or 24hr continuous infusion&#xD;
           depending on the time of drug application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the application of palliative sedation, caregiver's negative feelings such as anxiety&#xD;
           or guilt for palliative sufficiency are one of the biggest challenges as the patient's&#xD;
           consciousness is reduced, and they feels disconnected from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In general, hearing is known to persist until the very last moment of the end of life,&#xD;
           regardless of consciousness. In addition, maintaining communication with patients and&#xD;
           caregivers is the most important part of the hospice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study evaluate the efficacy of healthcare provider's recommended communication with&#xD;
           sympathy, &quot;Regardless of the patient's outward consciousness, talk with the patient and&#xD;
           express empathy. Hearing will be maintained until the end.&quot;&#xD;
