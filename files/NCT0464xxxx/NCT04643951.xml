  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a qualitative interview study, using Grounded Theory. The aim is to deepen our&#xD;
      knowledge about how the dental team (dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants) and&#xD;
      dental students perceive child patients' pain and how they perceive they are equipped to&#xD;
      prevent and deal with child patients' pain and the child's response to pain during and after&#xD;
      dental treatment.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Pain in conjunction with dental treatment should be avoided, especially when&#xD;
      treating children. Many dental procedures may result in procedural and/or postoperative pain.&#xD;
      There is a well-documented relationship between perceived pain during dental treatment, and&#xD;
      the development of dental fear and anxiety. This may lead to suffering for the patient,&#xD;
      avoidance of dental care, and increasing treatment costs for the individual and society.&#xD;
      Dental care professionals are responsible for providing as painless dental treatments as&#xD;
      possible to their child patients. Earlier studies have pointed towards an underusage of local&#xD;
      anesthetics when providing dental care to children. Though previous studies have not been&#xD;
      able to fully answer why this is. Thus, the aim of this study is to gain knowledge into how&#xD;
      dental professionals and students experience and relate to the child patient's experience of&#xD;
      pain during and after dental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD This is a qualitative study using Grounded Theory (GT). Dental students in their last&#xD;
      two years of education and dental professionals (dentists, dental hygienists, and dental&#xD;
      assistants), will be consecutively enrolled after signing an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-depth interviews of approximately one hour each will be performed with the informants at a&#xD;
      place of their convenience. Appropriate measures will be taken regarding public health&#xD;
      recommendations in effect due to the Covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In GT no sample size calculation is done. Participants will be included until saturation in&#xD;
      data is reached, i.e. no new information can be obtained from further interviews. In GT this&#xD;
      is often achieved after 10-15 interviews, but due to the scope of this study involving&#xD;
      several different professionals and students it is likely the number of informants will be&#xD;
      closer to 25. All interviews will be tape recorded, and without delay, the interviews will be&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim. Data analyses and data collection will be done in tandem. The&#xD;
      transcribed interviews will be analyzed, and codes identified. These codes will then be&#xD;
      merged into different preliminary categories. In the following axial coding process, each&#xD;
      category will be further developed by identifying common dimensions and characteristics&#xD;
      (subcategories). Relations between data and categories is sought, and hereby a new whole is&#xD;
      created. Selective coding will lead to data saturation and validation. Saturation can also be&#xD;
      achieved by already retrieved data being re-coded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KNOWLEDGE GAINS GT is a theory generating method. This is especially suitable for research&#xD;
      areas where theories are scarce or lacking. A lot of research within the medical and dental&#xD;
      field today, takes the perspective of the investigator, and far too seldom is the subjective&#xD;
      experience of those directly affected (e.g. professionals and/or patients) heard. From this&#xD;
      study we will gain new knowledge into dental professionals' and students' perception of the&#xD;
      child patients' experiences of procedural and postoperative pain. These knowledge gains will&#xD;
      be important for future research strategies related to pain. In the longer run the results&#xD;
      can help lead to a better training of undergraduate students and professionals.&#xD;
