  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an ancillary study of an intervention study (NCT04570709). The parent study is a&#xD;
      single institution, feasibility trial of 20 (10 control and 10 intervention) patients with&#xD;
      the primary objective of assessing feasibility, acceptability, and change in pre and post&#xD;
      measures of symptoms, function, and quality of life by administering the Palliative and&#xD;
      Collaborative Care In Tervention (PACT). We will further assess cognitive function in the&#xD;
      patients who participate in the parent study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to observe patient-reported and researcher-assessed cognitive function&#xD;
      in adults with acute myeloid leukemia with chemotherapy treatment. We will assess cognitive&#xD;
      function using a battery of neuropsychological assessments, patient-reported questionnaire,&#xD;
      and semi-structured interviews among participants in both control and intervention groups.&#xD;
      The group assignment will be conducted through parent study (NCT04570709). Participating in&#xD;
      this study will not affect participants' group assignment.&#xD;
