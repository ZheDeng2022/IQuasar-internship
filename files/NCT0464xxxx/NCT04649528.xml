    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two modes of delivering high-intensity interval&#xD;
      training (HIIT) in a population with inflammatory rheumatic disease over 10 weeks. One group&#xD;
      will recieved HIIT supervised by a healthcare professional, the other group will perform&#xD;
      self-monitored HITT with guidance by a smarthpone application.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      People with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRS) such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA),&#xD;
      spondyloarthritis (SpA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been shown to have&#xD;
      reduced cardiovascular fitness and quality of life than the general population.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular health is the single most important factor of total mortality. It has been&#xD;
      shown previously that individuals with IRS tolerate both endurance training, resulting in&#xD;
      improvement in function and cardiovascular health while also having a positive effect on&#xD;
      disease activity measured through inflammation, pain, joint health and fatigue. In recent&#xD;
      years, studies have also been conducted that demonstrate both the safety and effect of&#xD;
      aerobic 4x4min high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for patients with IRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve an intervention period consisting of 20 HIIT sessions. Participants&#xD;
      are randomized into one of two training groups. One group will perform HIIT under the&#xD;
      supervision of a healthcare professional. The other group will perform the same HIIT training&#xD;
      with identical instructions, however they will be self-monitored with the aid and guidance of&#xD;
      a mobilephone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the intervention is to increase maximum oxygen uptake and improve quality of&#xD;
      life. The intervention period will consist of 2 weekly sessions lasting approximately 35&#xD;
      minutes performed on non-consecutive days. The endurance training will consist of 4 intervals&#xD;
      of 4 minutes duration, separated by a 3-4 minute active break and follows the principle of&#xD;
      intensive aerobic interval training. Before and after the training period, identical testing&#xD;
      (approximately 30-40 min) will be performed by both intervention groups. The testing will&#xD;
      include measurements of work economy and maximal oxygen uptake in an endurance test.&#xD;
      Additionally, quality of life questionnaires will be obtained.&#xD;
