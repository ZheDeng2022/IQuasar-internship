  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I single center, open-label, non-randomized study in healthy male subjects,&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the mass balance recovery, PK, metabolism and absolute bioavailability&#xD;
      of single oral doses of PCO371. It is planned to enroll 12 subjects, with 6 subjects in each&#xD;
      of 2 study parts. Subjects in Part 1 will receive a single oral dose of [14C]PCO371 Oral&#xD;
      Solution. Subjects in Part 2 will receive a single oral dose of PCO371 capsules, followed by&#xD;
      a single intravenous infusion of [14C]PCO371 Solution for Infusion over 10 min, starting 2 h&#xD;
      post-oral dose. The study parts may be dosed in any order for logistical reasons (e.g. Part 2&#xD;
      may be dosed before Part 1). No subject will be permitted to take part in both study parts.&#xD;
