  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a series of double-blinded randomized cross-over acute studies, the investigators want to&#xD;
      study the effects of different types of barley on the glycemic index (GI) in subjects with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common type of barley in Denmark is with rind and demands processing before use.&#xD;
      Processing may remove important nutrients from the barley. Some of the original antiquity&#xD;
      barley has a loose rind (nude barley), that falls off during harvesting, and thereby reduces&#xD;
      the need for processing. The investigators want to study how this ancient type of barley&#xD;
      affects GI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, some of the investigators collaborative partners have made it possible to&#xD;
      increase the amount of amylose in regular barley by genetic modification. The investigators&#xD;
      want to study the effect on GI of this new type of modified barley.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approx. 60 mio. people worldwide live with diabetes and the prevalence is increasing. The&#xD;
      increase is primarily due to obesity, unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to find dietary products that counteracts this development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intake of food with a low glycemic index (GI) reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2D) and helps in the regulation of a preexisting diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barley has shown some beneficial effects on GI compared with wheat, however, barley is not&#xD;
      commonly used in bread making in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common type of barley in Denmark is with rind and demands processing before use.&#xD;
      Processing may remove important nutrients from the barley. Some of the original antiquity&#xD;
      barley has a loose rind (nude barley), that falls of during harvesting, and thereby reduces&#xD;
      the need for processing. However, it is not known how this ancient type of barley affects GI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composition of the starch in barley is of importance when the grain is degraded after&#xD;
      consumption. The starch consists of both amylose (which is slowly degraded) and amylopectin&#xD;
      (which is quickly degraded). By genetic modification, it was possible for collaborative&#xD;
      researchers at the Universities of Aarhus and Copenhagen to increase the amount of amylose in&#xD;
      regular barley. Slowly degraded starch is expected to decrease GI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a series of acute studies the investigators want to study the effects on the glucose&#xD;
      metabolism to intake of bread made with different compositions of wheat, nude barley and&#xD;
      gene-modified high-amylose barley in subjects with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that both nude barley and gene-modified high-amylose barley lowers the&#xD;
      postprandial glycemic response more than wheat and hereby positively affect the glycemic&#xD;
      regulation for subjects with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
