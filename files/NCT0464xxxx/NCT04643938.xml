    <textblock>
      uRM patients selected PGT-A from 2012 to 2016 were included in this study. Their clinical&#xD;
      outcomes were prospectively observed and analyzed to explore the factor influenced the&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      This prospective observational study enrolled all women with uRM who underwent&#xD;
      array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) for PGT-A in the Reproductive Medicine&#xD;
      Center of Peking University Third Hospital from 2012 to 2016. If a couple underwent multiple&#xD;
      stimulation cycles during the research period, only the first cycle was included. All&#xD;
      patients underwent adequate clinical and genetic consultations before undergoing PGT-A, and&#xD;
      all voluntarily chose PGT-A after fully understanding its risks and benefits. All patients&#xD;
      signed the informed consent document of PGT-A. All included stimulation cycles involved&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection insemination. After successfully fertilized embryos formed&#xD;
      blastocysts on Day 5-7, trophoblasts were biopsied to determine embryonic karyotypes. The&#xD;
      blastocysts with normal/balanced test results were cryopreserved, whereas abnormal&#xD;
      blastocysts were discarded after notifying the patients. All normal blastocysts from a&#xD;
      patient were thawed and transferred singly, and the outcomes of all subsequent frozen-thawed&#xD;
      embryo transfer cycles were followed-up until January 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes included the blastocyst formation rate, the proportion of blastocysts with&#xD;
      normal karyotypes, and the clinical pregnancy, live birth, and cumulative live birth rates.&#xD;
      The factors that affected these clinical outcomes were analyzed to predict outcomes and guide&#xD;
      treatment in women with uRM.&#xD;
