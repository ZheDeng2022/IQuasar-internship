  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is currently the most frequent primary bariatric&#xD;
      procedure performed worldwide. LSG is a safe and effective technique in terms of excess&#xD;
      weight loss and it is, moreover, a powerful metabolic operation that activates significant&#xD;
      hormonal pathways that lead to changes in eating behavior, glycemic control and intestinal&#xD;
      functions.Regarding a technical point of view, LSG might be considered a time saving&#xD;
      procedure for the absence of intestinal anastomosis. The most frequent and sometimes&#xD;
      dangerous complications are leaking, hemorrhage, splenic injury, stenosis and&#xD;
      Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). Despite its established efficacy and safety, dispute&#xD;
      still exists on the optimal conduction of LSG operative technique: bougie size, distance of&#xD;
      resection margin from the pylorus, the shape of section at the gastroesophageal junction,&#xD;
      staple line reinforcement and intraoperative leak testing are among the most controversial&#xD;
      issues .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the primary aim of the present retrospective multicentric study is to evaluate intra&#xD;
      and peri-operatory (&lt; 30 days) and post-operative (&gt; 30 days) morbidity and mortality rates&#xD;
      of patients undergone LSG, and the correlation of the latter rates with different surgical&#xD;
      measures. Secondary aim is to evaluate the strategy for the treatment of the complication,&#xD;
      and if there is a correlation between morbidity/mortality and volume of the Bariatric Center&#xD;

      This study is a retrospective multicenter trial conduct from January 2015 to December 2020 in&#xD;
      10 centers. All the procedures were performed by the (---- number of surgeons). Morbid&#xD;
      obesity was preoperatively diagnosed according to the International Federation for Surgery of&#xD;
      Obesity (IFSO) guidelines. Patients were collected in a electronic database and categorized&#xD;
      according to the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distance of resection margin from the pylorus (&gt;5 cm / &lt;5 cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bougie size (&gt;34 French, &lt;34 French)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distance of resection margin from the gastroesophageal junction (&gt;…cm/&lt;...cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staple line reinforcement (Yes/No - If yes, the reinforcement technique will be&#xD;
           reported)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative leak testing (Yes/No - If yes, the test used will be reported)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and size of trocar used and access closure technique (Yes/No - If yes, the&#xD;
           technique will be reported) The study protocol was approved by the regional Ethics&#xD;
           Committee. 2.2 Inclusion criteria Inclusion criteria were morbid obesity defined as BMI&#xD;
           40 kg/m2 or BMI&gt;35 with comorbidity and age between 25-60 years old. Obesity-related&#xD;
           comorbidities included Type 2 Mellitus Diabetes (T2MD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
           bronchial asthma, osteoarthritis and degenerative joint disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Exclusion Criteria Patients with endocrine disorders causing obesity (as hypothyroidism&#xD;
      and Cushing disease), pregnancy or lactation, psychiatric illness, or recent diagnosis of&#xD;
      malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, Barrett ́s esophagus, and GERD with esophagitis&#xD;
      scored as or greater than grade B, a large hiatal hernia (&gt;3 cm) were excluded from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Study Outcomes The primary aims of the present retrospective multicentric study is to&#xD;
      evaluate intra and peri and post operatory morbidity and mortality rates (&lt; 30 and &gt;30 days)&#xD;
      of patients undergone Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy, and the correlation of the latter&#xD;
      rates with different surgical measures. Secondary aims is to evaluate the strategy for the&#xD;
      treatment of the complication, and if there is a correlation between morbidity/mortality and&#xD;
      the volume of the Bariatric Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Blinding Process Physicians and staff who will collect the data and those who will&#xD;
      evaluate the endpoints will all be unaware of the patients allocation. Patients will be&#xD;
      collected in an electronic database with consecutive numbers without the possibility of&#xD;
      identifying the center of origin until the final evaluation of the study endpoints. As the&#xD;
      blinding process for the operating surgeons is not feasible, they are not involved in data&#xD;
      collection and evaluation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Pre-operative evaluation Preoperative evaluation included anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      (height in cm, weight in kg, Body Mass Index (BMI) in kg/m2), comorbidity evaluation&#xD;
      [Glycated Hemoglobin(A1c), C-peptide, stimulated C-peptide, Electrocardiography (ECG),&#xD;
      echocardiography, lower limbs US color-doppler study, thyroid function profile]. All patients&#xD;
      were evaluated for the presence/absence of Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease before surgery&#xD;
      through a preoperative upper endoscopy with an eventual esophageal biopsy. The presence of&#xD;
      helicobacter pylori is also investigated with for a rapid urease test on an antral specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 Surgical Technique The patient is placed in a split leg position with the surgeon located&#xD;
      in between the patient's legs. Closed pneumoperitoneum was established using our standard&#xD;
      technique of Verres needle insufflation in Palmer site and optical insertion of a 12-mm port&#xD;
      at a supraumbilical site (10-15 cm from umbilicus) Two further 15-mm and 12-mm ports were&#xD;
      placed respectively in the left and right ipocondrum as working ports. A subxiphoid track was&#xD;
      created using a 5-mm port for placement of a liver retractor. In patients with higher body&#xD;
      mass index who have severe visceral obesity, additional trocars can be added for retraction&#xD;
      of the omentum or big fatty livers, to optimize the exposure to reach the left crus. Once the&#xD;
      left crus is reached, an optimal exposure of the hiatus is mandatory to find incidental&#xD;
      hiatal hernias and a complete dissection of the left crus performed to prevent retained&#xD;
      fundus. The greater omentum was opened close to the stomach wall in some part in between the&#xD;
      fundus and the antrum to have greater curvature completely detached from the stomach; this&#xD;
      dissection starts at 2 cm or _____proximal to the pylorus and continued along the greater&#xD;
      curvature to the left crus. Posterior adhesions if present, were carefully divided. The left&#xD;
      gastrophrenic ligament was divided to expose the angle of His to identify the complete hiatus&#xD;
      and fundus. A bougie was positioned before starting resection of the stomach. Researchers use&#xD;
      a 36French bougie or --------- Researchers have chosen cartridges Black at the antrum level&#xD;
      and finished with a purple cartridge. Researchers always checked the posterior wall before&#xD;
      firing. Once Researchers have reached the proximal stomach, the stapler has to be positioned&#xD;
      1 cm lateral to the left of the angle of His to avoid inclusion of esophageal tissue.&#xD;
      Methylene blue test is performed routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.8 Post-operative evaluation Regarding the primary endpoints, intraoperative complications&#xD;
      (i.e. splenectomy, bleeding, positive leak test if performed) and type treatment are&#xD;
      collected and recorded. Perioperative complications (&lt;30 days) considered are mortality,&#xD;
      morbidity (i.e. leak, bleeding, occlusion, pneumonia, vascular complications, portal&#xD;
      pulmonary-splenic embolism) and type treatment. Postoperative complications (&gt;30 days)&#xD;
      considered are morbidity, mortality (i.e. leak, embolism, Incisional trocar hernia, other)&#xD;
      and type treatment Regarding the secondary endpoint, in case of gastric fistula onset its&#xD;
      diagnosis method (clinical, instrumental) and its management (timing, surgical or endoscopic&#xD;
      - endoprosthesis, pigtails, clips-) or both) are collected and recorded. In case of&#xD;
      postoperative bleeding, its diagnosis method (clinical, instrumental) and its management&#xD;
      (timing, Surgical, medical) are collected and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 Statistical Analysis Continuous data are expressed as median and interquartile (25-75th)&#xD;
      range or mean and Standard Deviation (SD), unless otherwise indicated. Differences between&#xD;
      preoperative and postoperative parameters were compared by Wilcoxon paired rank test. Median&#xD;
      time of follow-up was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable analysis was&#xD;
      conducted through a forward-backward stepwise Cox regression based on Akaike Information&#xD;
      Criterion (AIC) considering age, gender, % Excess Weighth Loss, Body Mass Index and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all tests, the cut-off for statistical significance was set at p= 0.05. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed using R v3.5.0.&#xD;
