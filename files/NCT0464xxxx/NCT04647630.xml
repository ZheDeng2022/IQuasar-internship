  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an epidemiology study for the prevalence and serotypes of pneumococcus pneumoniae in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The serotypes of the&#xD;
      pneumococcus pneumoniae will be determined by a urinary antigen assay. This is a single&#xD;
      center, non-interventional observatory study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the medical wards with a provisional diagnosis under &quot;pneumonia&quot;,&quot;chest&#xD;
      infection&quot; or &quot;fever&quot; will be screened by research assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible with the inclusion criteria will be recruited into the study. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be signed for those patients willing to participate in the study. Patient will&#xD;
      be asked to save approximately 40 ml of urine. The urine sample will be processed in local&#xD;
      laboratory and shipped out to a commercial lab for detection of any pneumococcal pneumoniae,&#xD;
      and if present, serotyping will be performed at the same time using the same urine sample by&#xD;
      urinary antigen assay. Meanwhile patients will be managed as usual by their clinical teams.&#xD;
      Investigations and treatment will be offered by the clinical team as deemed necessary. The&#xD;
      study team will only perform collection of urine and will not interfere the clinical&#xD;
      management of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive results would be informed to the clinical teams for the appropriate action.&#xD;
