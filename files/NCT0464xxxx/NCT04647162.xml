  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary pontine hemorrhage (PPH) is not common but is the most catastrophic subtype of&#xD;
      intracerebral hemorrhage, with acute mortality between 30% and 60%. For severe PPH, defined&#xD;
      as Glasgow Coma score (GCS) &lt;8 and hematoma volumeâ‰¥5ml, the mortality rate is as high as&#xD;
      80-100%. Guidelines from the American Heart Association and European Stroke Organization do&#xD;
      not make definite specifications. More than a century after Finkelnburg first explored the&#xD;
      brainstem for hematoma, however, plenty of researches have shown surgery can save lives and&#xD;
      improve the prognosis for selective patients and can be an effective and safe treatment. This&#xD;
      study is proposed to validate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment in severe primary&#xD;
      pontine hemorrhage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted from Jan 2021 to Dec 2025 in 20 neurosurgical units. It&#xD;
      comprises 2 parts: the registry part and the trial part. The registry part is a multicentric,&#xD;
      real-world registry. The trial part is designed as a multicenter, prospective, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. The two parts include the intervention group and the medical group. The&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of surgical treatment in severe primary pontine hemorrhage will be&#xD;
      validated.&#xD;

    <measure>The 5-level EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) version (EQ-5D-5L) at Day 90</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The former descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The latter is numbered from 0 to 100. 100 means the best health you can imagine. 0 means the worst health you can imagine.</description>
