  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IV placement is necessary for surgical procedures. Unfortunately, some patients say that&#xD;
      placing an IV is painful. The investigators are conducting this study to evaluate two&#xD;
      techniques that could make the placement of the IV more comfortable.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, some medical providers administer the IV without any pain-relieving techniques.&#xD;
      Some medical providers inject a numbing medication underneath the skin prior to the IV&#xD;
      placement. This requires an additional needle stick. Some medical providers place a device&#xD;
      called Buzzy® on a patient's arm prior to the IV placement. The Buzzy® device is the&#xD;
      combination of an ice pack and a vibrator in the shape of a bumble bee. Literature shows that&#xD;
      the Buzzy® device makes IV placement more comfortable for children, but there is minimal data&#xD;
      in regard to whether it is helpful for adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are conducting this study to compare the effectiveness of the Buzzy® device&#xD;
      with that of the injection of numbing medication underneath the skin for IV placement in&#xD;
      adults. This device has been FDA approved for use.&#xD;

    <description>How much pain do adult patients experience with peripheral IV cannulation when Buzzy® device is used versus when intradermal lidocaine 2% is used? The Visual Analog Scale is used for linear measurement of pain, where the minimum number is 0 (no pain) and the maximum number is 10 (unimaginable pain).</description>

    <description>How much satisfaction do adult patients experience with peripheral IV cannulation when Buzzy® device is used versus when intradermal lidocaine 2% is used? The Numerical Rating Scale is used for linear measurement of satisfaction, where the minimum number is 1 (very dissatisfied) and the maximum number is 5 (very satisfied).</description>

    <description>An elastic band will be placed around the subject's arm, and the elastic band will be removed once the IV is inserted. After the elastic band is placed on the subject's arm, the arm will be cleaned, and then a small skin wheel will be created with the lidocaine that will be injected very close to where the IV will be placed. The IV will be placed within about a minute from the time when the lidocaine was injected.</description>
