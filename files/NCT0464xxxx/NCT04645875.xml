  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether substituting sitting with standing and&#xD;
      light-intensity activity in free-living conditions can reduce glycaemia in overweight/obese&#xD;
      South Asian adults.&#xD;

      Anthropometric measurement tools including a stadiometer, a measurement tape and digital&#xD;
      weighing scale, activity monitor and Flash Glucose Monitor and sensor will be posted to the&#xD;
      participants' home or workplace or research team drop all these items to participants'&#xD;
      doorstep to allow participants to take their measures including height, weight, and waist&#xD;
      circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant will have to perform a try-out day of the SitLess regimen for 24 hours&#xD;
      before starting the study and it will be performed after preliminary testing and before the&#xD;
      first experimental condition. Those participants will be included for this study who will be&#xD;
      able to adhere to the protocol based on a review of the activPAL activity monitor data that&#xD;
      will be worn during the day. Additionally, a second attempt will be offered to them to adhere&#xD;
      to the protocol if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undertake two separate activity regimens in free-living conditions which&#xD;
      will be lasting 4-day each condition in a random order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      # Sit regimen: Participants will be instructed to restrict walking and standing to ≤1 h/day&#xD;
      each (total ≤2 h/day ) and the remainder of the waking day will be seated apart from visiting&#xD;
      the toilet. They will be allowed to perform their daily activities including cooking and&#xD;
      other household activities within the 2 h of permitted walking and standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      #SitLess regimen: Participants will be instructed to substitute a minimum of 5h/day of&#xD;
      sitting with ≥2 h of light-intensity physical activity and ≥3 h of standing. Participants&#xD;
      will be advised to rise from the seated position for 2-5 min every 30 min to engage in&#xD;
      standing /light-intensity physical activities to interrupt their sitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each activity regimen, participants will be asked to record all of the activities in&#xD;
      an activity logbook. In addition, they will be asked to weigh (using kitchen scales) and&#xD;
      record food and beverage consumption in a diary for the first four days (days 1-4) and then&#xD;
      replicate the dietary intakes and timings exactly for the second four days (days 8-11). They&#xD;
      will need to make sure that each meal contains at least 50% carbohydrate. Kitchen scales and&#xD;
      a food diary will be provided by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the 11 days, participants will be required to avoid alcohol consumption and&#xD;
      performing exercise (e.g. brisk walking, sports, going to the gym, cycling, running etc).&#xD;
