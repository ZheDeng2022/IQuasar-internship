      This study is a two-stage, pivotal, prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, within patient&#xD;
      comparison of the SENSE device and the standard diagnostic test, head CT scan in patients&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of primary spontaneous ICH or traumatic intracranial bleeding for the&#xD;

      This study is a two-stage, pivotal, prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, within patient&#xD;
      comparison of the SENSE device and the standard diagnostic test, head CT scan in patients&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of primary spontaneous ICH (parenchymal ICH without secondary causes, such&#xD;
      as arteriovenous malformation, cavernoma, aneurysm, hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic&#xD;
      stroke, venous sinus thrombosis) or traumatic intracranial bleeding (defined as epidural&#xD;
      hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage and/or traumatic contusions/intraparenchymal hemorrhage) for&#xD;
      the detection and monitoring of intracranial hemorrhages. All subjects with any spontaneous&#xD;
      or traumatic ICH who meet eligibility criteria should be enrolled. We anticipate that some&#xD;
      TBI patients with traumatic ICH may not have a prolonged hospital stay and the standard&#xD;
      practice in these patients who do not experience hemorrhage expansion is to obtain a head CT&#xD;
      within 6-24 hours. It is anticipated that the majority of subjects admitted to the hospital,&#xD;
      i.e., spontaneous ICH or TBI patients who experience hemorrhage expansion, will be managed in&#xD;
      an intensive care unit (ICU). Mild TBI with traumatic ICH patients may be managed outside of&#xD;
      an ICU depending on local practice. The SENSE device will be evaluated in subjects at risk of&#xD;
      early and delayed hemorrhage expansion.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the positive predictive value (PPV) of the SENSE device alarm compared to the results from the CT scan. In Stage 1, the 6-24-hour CT will be the primary comparator CT in non-ICU subjects and the 48-hour CT will be the primary comparator CT in ICU subjects. In Stage 2, the 6-24-hour CT will be the primary comparator CT in non-ICU subjects for whom the SENSE device does not alert; the 48-hour CT will be the primary comparator CT in ICU subjects for whom the SENSE device does not alert. The CT corresponding to the SENSE alert within 48 hours of enrollment will be the primary comparator in subjects for whom the device alerts.</description>

    <description>The SENSE Device is indicated for the monitoring of intracranial hemorrhage by detecting a suspected increase in blood volume within the cranial vault. It is an adjunctive device to the clinical evaluation in the acute hospital setting of patients 22 years of age or older with suspected or known intracranial hemorrhage. The device is indicated for use to monitor patients for intracranial hemorrhage expansion between CT scans but should not serve as a substitute for these scans.</description>
