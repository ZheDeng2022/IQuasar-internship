  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consuming high levels of dietary phosphate and poor adherence of phosphate-binding-therapy&#xD;
      might induce hyperphosphatemia in the hemodialysis (HD) patients. Therefore, the risks of&#xD;
      Chronic Kidney Disease-related Mineral and Bone Disorders (CKD-MBDs) and inflammation will be&#xD;
      increased. This double blind and intervention randomized controlled trial study will be&#xD;
      designed to investigate the hypothesis that if low phosphorus meals decrease serum phosphorus&#xD;
      concentration and inflammatory indicators. A total of 80 HD patients in the HD center of&#xD;
      Shuang Ho Hospital will be recruited and be assigned to low phosphorus meal group (LP group)&#xD;
      and control group randomly before one-week-washout period. The subjects of LP group and&#xD;
      control group will consume low phosphorus meals and standard meals respectively. During&#xD;
      washout period and study period, all subjects will continue to consume their regular&#xD;
      breakfast and take one tablet of calcium carbonate with meal. All data will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline, one week after the washout period, and the end of the 7-days-study period. The&#xD;
      indicators are including dietary contents, phosphate binder administration, indicators of&#xD;
      dialysis adequacy, nutritional indicators, blood lipid indicators, biochemical indicators,&#xD;
      CKD-MBDs indicators, and inflammation indicators. Data were analyzed by Statistical Product&#xD;
      and Service Solutions program version 18. Paired t-test, Student's t-test, Pearson&#xD;
      correlation coefficient and Logistic regression will be used. P &lt; 0.05 will be considered as&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;

      Study Design and Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was design as a randomized, double-blind control trail. A total of 80 HD patients&#xD;
      were recruited from the HD center of Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital in Taiwan.&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were including â‰§20 years old and non vegetarian. The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are including liver dysfunction, cancer and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects followed their usual diets but took one tablet of calcium carbonate as phosphate&#xD;
      binder per meal for the first week washout diet. After washout diet, subjects were assign to&#xD;
      control or study group randomly and entered to the study period for one week. The diets of&#xD;
      the study group were low phosphorus ( LP group), but the dietary phosphorous levels of the&#xD;
      control group were not modified. During the study period, all subjects including LP group and&#xD;
      control group still kept their usually accustomed behavior about regular breakfast and also&#xD;
      took one tablet of calcium carbonate as phosphate binder with every breakfast meal. The LP&#xD;
      group and control group replaced daily lunch and dinner with low phosphorus and standard&#xD;
      meals respectively and should not take any phosphate binder during the study period for one&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For controlling the volumes of proteins, phosphorus and calcium easily, the main courses of&#xD;
      both of the study and the control meals were made by a central kitchen. All of the meals&#xD;
      contained 3 exchanges of protein (25 g) and 1 exchange of vegetable. There were 5 main&#xD;
      courses for the both diets. The proteins of the study meals had been removed by an average 20&#xD;
      -30% of the phosphorus through boiling the meats before cooking process. But the boiling&#xD;
      method did not process for the control meals. Every meal including all the study and the&#xD;
      control meals contained one tablet of calcium carbonate. As a consequence, the additional&#xD;
      phosphate binders should not be taken while eating the study meals. The subjects had to&#xD;
      prepare carbohydrate by themselves, and they could choose any source of carbohydrate as their&#xD;
      wants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The personal characteristics and the anthropometry data were collected at baseline. All data&#xD;
      were collected at baseline, one week after the washout period, and the end of the&#xD;
      7-days-study period. The indicators were including dietary contents, phosphate binder&#xD;
      administration, dialysis adequacy, nutritional indicators, blood lipid indicators,&#xD;
      biochemical indicators, CKD-MBDs indicators, and inflammation indicators.&#xD;
