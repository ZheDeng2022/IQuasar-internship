  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project deals with patients undergoing surgery in the neck due to benign tumor in the&#xD;
      thyroid gland in order to remove pressure symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The background of the project is a recent series of studies (Sorensen, Watt et al. 2017)&#xD;
      (Sorensen, Watt et al. 2017), showing that patients are very adversely affected by a reduced&#xD;
      voice function and pain the neck/shoulders in the first weeks and months after the operation.&#xD;
      In general, the patients quality of life is impaired in this period. Due to this, it is&#xD;
      relevant to seek ways to reduce the discomfort symptoms after the operation by performing&#xD;
      simple and specific chosen stretching exercises for the muscles in the neck and shoulders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the project are randomly divided into two groups, and both groups are&#xD;
      answering questionnaires after 1,2, 4 weeks and after 3 months regarding their short time&#xD;
      quality of life focusing on voice function and pain in the neck and shoulders. The patients&#xD;
      in the intervention group are instructed in stretching and mobility exercises for neck and&#xD;
      shoulder starting the day after surgery and they are supposed to perform them every day in&#xD;
      four weeks after surgery. The control group are not performing these exercises and are not&#xD;
      informed that there concurrently is an intervention going on. In this way the questionnaires&#xD;
      can be compared in the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that short time quality of life including voice function and pain the neck&#xD;
      and shoulder can be improved for this group of patients with these specific stretching and&#xD;
      mobility exercises. The project is of great clinical relevance and can in case of confirmed&#xD;
      hypothesis be applied in clinical practice immediately benefitting the patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background/introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removing all or part of the thyroid gland by surgery, has routinely been used for more than&#xD;
      100 years for the treatment of patients with benign as well as malignant thyroid disease. It&#xD;
      is generally accepted that quality of life is improved three-to-six months after surgery&#xD;
      (Mishra, Sabaretnam et al. 2013) (Sorensen, Watt et al. 2017) (Watt, Cramon et al. 2014).&#xD;
      However, in the days and weeks following thyroid surgery, patients often experience muscle&#xD;
      pain and stiffness of the neck and shoulders (Yuuki Takumara 2005). In addition, 2-4 weeks&#xD;
      postoperatively voice discomfort symptoms can be pronounced, and although short-termed and&#xD;
      passing, patients experience a decreased quality of life (Sorensen, Printz et al. 2019)&#xD;
      (Vicente, Solomon et al. 2014) (Ryu, Ryu et al. 2013). The accumulation of such symptoms in&#xD;
      the weeks just after surgery may reduce quality of live significantly. Therefore, any&#xD;
      rehabilitative interventions which may reduce discomfort are highly relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limited number of randomized trials have investigated the effect of early postoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitative measures such as neck stretching. Rehabilitation with stretching exercises is&#xD;
      found to reduce neck pain, neck stiffness, and the need for postoperative pain relief&#xD;
      medication (Yuuki Takumara 2005) (Hatice Ayhan 2016). No study has examined the effect of&#xD;
      neck stretching exercises on short term quality of life improvements in relation to voice&#xD;
      function despite many of the neck muscles are used for voice production. The same goes for&#xD;
      the impact of neck stretching exercises on short term quality of life improvements in&#xD;
      relation to neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Purpose The objective is to examine the effect of neck stretching exercises&#xD;
      performed shortly after hemi- and total thyroidectomy on short term quality of life in&#xD;
      relation to subjective voice function and neck pain in the first four weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population In-hospital patients with benign thyroid disease having undergone thyroid&#xD;
      surgery at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology (ORL) - Head &amp; Neck Surgery, Odense&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and patient recruitment Patients will be recruited for this randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical study the day after surgery. Participants are randomized into two groups&#xD;
      using a randomization scheme according to whether the surgery is performed in a week with an&#xD;
      even or uneven number (e.g. week number 42 or 43 within a given year). A designated person&#xD;
      with no impact on the decision of surgical procedure will handle the randomization and&#xD;
      recruitment (the project owner).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are randomized to either intervention with nine specific and carefully selected&#xD;
      neck stretching and mobility exercises or to the control group without any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before discharge, both groups are instructed to perform either stretching exercises or to no&#xD;
      intervention, respectively, the four postoperative weeks. A follow-up phone call will be made&#xD;
      approximately one week after discharge to ensure patient adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The effect will be examined for both the intervention group and control group through&#xD;
      an electronic questionnaire comprising three parts (see below) with focus on short term&#xD;
      quality of life, subjective voice function, and neck pain, respectively. A baseline status&#xD;
      will be made by the patient at enrollment on the first postoperative day, by recalling the&#xD;
      four weeks prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be answered a total of three times during the 4 weeks postoperative&#xD;
      period. The questionnaires will be delivered by a secure email system one week, two weeks,&#xD;
      four weeks and three months after surgery. Futhermore, every patient in both groups will take&#xD;
      a blood sample four weeks postoperative to examine the level of TSH (thyroid-stimulating&#xD;
      hormone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization groups (see &quot;arms&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention Group: Neck stretching&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group: No intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Thyroid-Related Patient-Reported Outcome (ThyPRO-39) ThyPRO is a patient-reported&#xD;
           outcome covering Quality of Life symptoms specifically validated for patients with&#xD;
           benign thyroid diseases, including patients undergoing thyroidectomy. The ThyPRO&#xD;
           consists of 39 items and is rated by the patient on a Likert scale from 0-4 with 0 = no&#xD;
           symptoms/problems and 4 = Severe symptoms/problems (Watt, Bjorner et al. 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Numeric Rating Scale (NRS Pain Score) The Numerical Rating Scale is a pain assessment&#xD;
           tool by which the patient is asked to rate their pain on a scale between 0 and 10 (0&#xD;
           represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;the worst pain ever possible&quot;) (Haefeli and&#xD;
           Elfering 2006)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Voice handicap Index 10 The Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10) is a scale designed to&#xD;
           focus on the patients' self-perception of their voice disorders. The VHI-10 is a list of&#xD;
           ten statements, each of which is evaluated by the patient on a five-point Likert like&#xD;
           scale (0-4 points) in relation to the frequency of their experienced voice symptoms&#xD;
           (never, almost never, sometimes, almost always, always) (Michael S. Benninger 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. European Quality Of Life (EQ-5D) The EQ-5D is a standardized non-disease specific&#xD;
           instrument to describe and value health-related quality of life. The questionnaire&#xD;
           consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and&#xD;
           anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate&#xD;
           problems, severe problems and extreme problems. Futhermore, it ends with a vertical&#xD;
           visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can&#xD;
           imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine from 0 to 100. (Foundation 2020, June 09)&#xD;
