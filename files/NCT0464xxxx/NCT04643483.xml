    <intervention_model_description>The study will be conducted in 3 parts:&#xD;
Part A will investigate 2 certolizumab pegol (CZP) dosing regimens with the objective of selecting a regimen that provides the highest rate of clinical remission. A cohort of participants will receive adalimumab (ADA) as a reference arm in Part A to assess clinical remission rates at Week 26 in this population. Endoscopic remission at Week 26 will also be evaluated&#xD;
Part B will assess maintenance of clinical remission from Week 26 through Week 52&#xD;
Part C is an optional open-label extension (OLE) of CZP after Part B, and will evaluate the long-term safety of CZP through Week 156</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Clinical remission based on total Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score ≤10.0 points at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score ≤ 10.&#xD;
The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) consists of 4 domains (laboratory, height/weight, examination, and history) with several assessments that are converted into a total PCDAI score which can range from 0 to 100 points, with a higher score indicating more severe disease activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical remission (modified) at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission (modified) is defined as a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score ≤ 10 and the abdominal pain and stool frequency items in the PCDAI having scores of 0.&#xD;
The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) consists of 4 domains (laboratory, height/weight, examination, and history) with several assessments that are converted into a PCDAI score which can range from 0 to 100 points, with a higher score indicating more severe disease activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Corticosteroid free clinical remission is defined as not taking corticosteroids after tapering, within 4 weeks prior to Week 26, and total PCDAI score ≤10.0 points and the abdominal pain and stool frequency items in the PCDAI having scores of 0 at Week 26.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical response at Week 26 and Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26; Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a decrease from Week 0 in Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score of ≥ 15 points and a total PCDAI score ≤ 30 points. The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) consists of 4 domains (laboratory, height/weight, examination, and history) with several assessments that are converted into a PCDAI score which can range from 0 to 100 points, with a higher score indicating more severe disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Endoscopic remission at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic remission is defined as Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease [SES-CD] from 0 to 2, with a higher score indicating more disease activity. SES-CD is based on four endoscopic variables (presence and size of ulcers, proportion of surface covered by ulcers, proportion of surface affected by disease, and presence and severity of stenosis). Each of the four SES-CD variables is scored from 0 to 3, with the sum of the scores for each variable ranging from 0 to 15, except for the presence and extent of stenosis, which ranges from 0 to 11, yielding a total SES-CD score of 0-56.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to the Safety Follow-Up visit (Week 166)</time_frame>
    <description>A Serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:&#xD;
Results in death&#xD;
Is life-threatening&#xD;
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
Results in persistent disability/incapacity&#xD;
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;
Other important medical events which based on medical or scientific judgement may jeopardize the patients, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above</description>

    <measure>Incidence of TEAEs leading to permanent withdrawal of investigational medicinal product</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to the Safety Follow-Up visit (Week 166)</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
