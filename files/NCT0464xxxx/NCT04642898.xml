  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will determine the feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of a study&#xD;
      that tests: 1) personalized treatment delivery (i.e., module sequencing and treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation timing) aimed at increasing the efficiency of care, and 2) the research&#xD;
      protocol designed to evaluate the effects of this personalized care. A sample of 60&#xD;
      participants with heterogeneous anxiety disorders (and comorbid conditions, including&#xD;
      depression) will be enrolled in a pilot sequential multiple assignment randomized trial&#xD;
      (SMART). Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three sequencing conditions:&#xD;
      transdiagnostic treatment administered in its standard module order, module sequences that&#xD;
      prioritize capitalizing on relative strengths, and module sequences that prioritize&#xD;
      compensating for relative weaknesses. Next, after 6 sessions, participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either continue or discontinue treatment to evaluate post-treatment change at&#xD;
      varying levels of target engagement. This proposal will enable us to 1) test the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and tolerability of the research protocol, treatment sequencing conditions,&#xD;
      and early treatment discontinuation, 2) determine whether a preliminary signal that&#xD;
      capitalization or compensation module sequencing improves treatment efficiency exists, and 3)&#xD;
      explore preliminary associations between core process engagement at treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      and later symptom improvement. The proposed study, and the subsequent research it will&#xD;
      support, will inform evidence-based decision rules to make existing treatments more&#xD;
      efficient, ultimately reducing patient costs and increasing the mental health service&#xD;
      system's capacity to address the needs of more individuals.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical severity will be measured using the Diagnostic Interview for Anxiety, Mood, and Obsessive Compulsive and Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders (DIAMOND) dimensional clinician ratings. Scores range from 1-7; higher scores indicate greater severity.</description>

    <description>Anxiety symptoms will be measured using the Overall Anxiety Severity and Interference Scale (OASIS). This is a self-report measure in which scores range from 0-20; higher scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-Reported Aversive Reactions to Emotions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (baseline, week 1, week, 2, week, 3.....week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Aversive reactions to emotions will be measured using the distress aversion subscale of the Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (MEAQ). This is a self-report measure in which scores range from 13-78; higher scores indicate greater negative reactions to emotional experiences.</description>
