  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute allergic rhinitis is a common allergic reaction to things like pollen or dust. It&#xD;
      causes inflammation inside the nose, resulting in symptoms similar to the common cold.&#xD;
      Allergic rhinitis is also known as hay fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to learn what participants think of betamethasone plus&#xD;
      loratadine as a treatment for their acute allergic rhinitis. These participants will have&#xD;
      used betamethasone plus loratadine as a treatment for their acute allergic rhinitis within&#xD;
      the past two months. During the study, participants will complete an online questionnaire&#xD;
      about their experience with betamethasone plus loratadine.&#xD;
