  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate if glenohumeral arthroscopy and arthroscopic subacromial decompression is more&#xD;
      effective than glenohumeral arthroscopy alone in improving patient-reported outcome at 12&#xD;
      months in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) who are non-responders to&#xD;
      non-operative treatment.&#xD;

&quot;How are the problems related to your shoulder now, compared with before surgery?&quot; (response options: no problems at all, much better, slightly better, no change, slightly worse, much worse)&#xD;
&quot;Overall, how pleased have you been with the result of your surgery so far?&quot; (response options: very pleased, fairly pleased, not very pleased, very disappointed)&#xD;
&quot;If you could go back in time, would you still choose to have the shoulder operation?&quot; (response options: yes, no, not sure).</description>

    <description>In addition to the glenohumeral athroscopy a lateral portal (approximately 2-3 cm distal to the lateral edge of acromion) will be used to access the subacromial space. The subacromial space will be decompressed with removal of inflamed bursal tissue and acromioclavicular osteophytes, release of the coracoacromial ligament, and, if deemed necessary by the surgeon, acromioplasty performed ad modum Caspari.</description>

    <intervention_name>Glenohumeral arthroscopy + lateral skin incision</intervention_name>
    <description>Glenohumeral arthroscopy is performed as a standard investigational procedure. The patient is put under general anesthesia and positioned in the 'beach chair position'. An anteriorsuperior portal (approximately 3 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the anterior edge of acromion) and a posterior mid-glenoid portal (approximately 2 cm inferior and 1 cm medial to the posterolateral corner of acromion) are used as entry to the joint. The following structures are investigated as a minimum: the articular surface of the humeral head and the glenoid, labrum, the long biceps tendon and its attachment at the superior labrum, the undersurface of the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus tendon, the subscapularis tendon and the glenohumeral ligaments. To allow for the best possible blinding a skin incision (mimicking the one used for arthroscopic subacromial decompression) is performed on the lateral side of the shoulder of the participants in the control group.</description>
