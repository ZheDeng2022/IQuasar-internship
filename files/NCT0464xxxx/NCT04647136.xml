  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Singapore, like many developed countries, is experiencing low birth rates, which is coupled&#xD;
      with increasing age at first marriage and birth. In addition, demand for assisted&#xD;
      reproduction technology treatments has increased over the years. Fertility awareness surveys&#xD;
      have consistently shown that public awareness of age-related fertility decline and the&#xD;
      limitations of fertility treatments is generally low, and this may lead to couples not&#xD;
      optimising their fertility potential to achieve their family aspirations. This trial aims to&#xD;
      study the effect of fertility health screening and fertility awareness tools on knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes and practice around childbearing among young Singaporean married couples.&#xD;
