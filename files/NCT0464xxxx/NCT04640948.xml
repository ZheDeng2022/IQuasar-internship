  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lung conditions such as smoking related lung damage lead to breathing fail. This&#xD;
      results in accumulation of gases such as carbon-di-oxide in the body especially during&#xD;
      periods of illness known as exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current management of carbon-di-oxide accumulation is administration of oxygen, nebulisers,&#xD;
      antibiotics etc and if necessary, provide a tight fitting mask around the face to provide&#xD;
      breathing support. If this fails, then a patient is placed on a mechanical ventilator. The&#xD;
      tight fitting mask therapy is also called non-invasive ventilation and is used widely but&#xD;
      patients acceptability of the therapy is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing a high flow of air with some oxygen could potentially provide the same benefit of&#xD;
      the non-invasive ventilation and may also be better accepted by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the knowledge and evidence from studies suggest a beneficial role for this high&#xD;
      flow therapy but this has not been investigated in well designed studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study we aim to investigate whether use of the high flow therapy reduces the&#xD;
      need for non-invasive ventilation in patients who present with a recent onset accumulation of&#xD;
      carbon-di-oxide in their body due to long-term lung disease. If this shows benefit, it will&#xD;
      lead to a bigger trial with patient benefiting by reduction in the non-invasive ventilation&#xD;
      or indeed a need for an invasive breathing machine.&#xD;
