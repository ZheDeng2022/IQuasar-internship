      This is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the range of metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities observed in patients living with HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART).&#xD;
      This study will also explore the concurrent role of poor oral health in supporting and&#xD;
      driving chronic immune activation and inflammation in HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrollment in study, patients will be followed up every 6 months for approximately&#xD;
      2.5 years (30 months). During this period, comprehensive medical records will be obtained,&#xD;
      and study data will be updated every 6 months; questionnaires will be handed to patients&#xD;
      periodically to assess quality of life and effects of xerostomia on QoL; social history will&#xD;
      be assessed using TAPS; oral health will be evaluated every 6 months and blood, saliva, and&#xD;
      oral swabs collected every 6 months. DXA scan and panoramic radiographs will also be taken at&#xD;
      baseline and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, caries rate, periodontal health, bone loss, QoL, salivary quantity&#xD;
      and composition, presence or absence of white/red lesions, as well as inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      and immune activation markers will be assessed.&#xD;
