  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to establish if powered exoskeleton&#xD;
      therapy as a part of a rehabilitation program can be used as a standard of care in stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;

      This prospective randomized control trial with three treatment arms will begin by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining if the subject is a candidate for exoskeleton treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomly assigning subjects to three groups (physical therapy only, exoskeleton only, or&#xD;
           a hybrid of physical therapy and exoskeleton).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body measurements to individualize the fit of the exoskeleton to each subject at each&#xD;
           session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activities-based balance confidence (ABC) questionnaire will be administered before and&#xD;
           after the study begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timed up and go test (TUGT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ten-meter walk test (10MWT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six-minute walk test (6MWT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Berg Balance Test (BBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five times sit to stand (5XSTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate through a portable heartrate monitor.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post tests up to six weeks apart</time_frame>
    <description>Subject sits in a standard armchair and stands, and at a self-selected walking speed, walks 3 meters, turns, and walks back to the chair, and sits down. They will be timed. Takes three minutes to administer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ten meter walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post tests up to six weeks apart</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be timed as they walk a known distance of 10 meters to determine his self-selected walking velocity (distance/time). They will be timed. Takes five minutes to administer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post tests up to six weeks apart</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures distance walked in six minutes to assess a patient's physical endurance. They walk at a self-selected speed and will be timed. This test takes approximately 10 minutes to administer</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post tests up to six weeks apart</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg balance test is a reliable measure for predicting risk for fall. This 14-item test measures static and dynamic balance measures and takes 15-20 minutes to administer</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post tests up to six weeks apart</time_frame>
    <description>This has been shown to be an effective tool for assessing the psychological impact of balance impairment and falls and measuring an individual's balance confidence. Using a Likert scale, this self-administered test evaluates a person's confidence in balance over various activities. This 16-question test takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete.</description>
