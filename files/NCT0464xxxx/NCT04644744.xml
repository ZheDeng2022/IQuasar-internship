  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The common practice of conventional cold storage (CCS) organ preservation has changed little&#xD;
      since the initial introduction of the original University of Wisconsin (UW) organ&#xD;
      preservation solution in the late 1980s. CCS relies on hypothermia to decelerate metabolism&#xD;
      and reduce oxygen demand in order to prolong the time of ischemia without rapid functional&#xD;
      graft impairment, therefore merely delaying graft damage. While CCS only prolongs storage&#xD;
      time and limits the damage sustained during the period of cold ischemia, ex-vivo machine&#xD;
      perfusion (MP) appears to be capable of reversing some of these effects. Currently, two main&#xD;
      paradigms prevail in the clinical approach to liver allograft MP: hypothermic oxygenated MP&#xD;
      (HOPE) may be seen as a dynamic alternative of the traditional organ preservation based on&#xD;
      hypothermia-induced deceleration of metabolism, which aims to combine the positive effects of&#xD;
      hypothermia observed in classical cold storage (e.g. technical simplicity, relative safety,&#xD;
      decreased metabolism) with the positive effects of dynamic preservation (e.g. controlled&#xD;
      sheer stress mediated gene activation, removal of metabolites, transport of oxygen and ATP&#xD;
      recharging). Normothermic perfusion (NMP) aims at re-equilibration of cellular metabolism by&#xD;
      preserving the organ at physiological temperatures whilst ensuring sufficient oxygen and&#xD;
      nutrient supply. In both approaches, the perpetual circulation and moderate shear-stress&#xD;
      sustain endothelial functionality. While past and current clinical trials were designed to&#xD;
      compare different MP approaches with CCS as the clinical standard, a direct comparison&#xD;
      between different end-ischemic MP techniques (HOPE versus NMP) is still lacking. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to test the effects of end-ischemic NMP versus end-ischemic HOPE technique&#xD;
      in a multicentre prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) on ECD liver grafts&#xD;
      in DBD liver-transplantation (HOPE-NMP). Two-hundred-thirteen (n = 213) human whole organ&#xD;
      liver grafts will be submitted to either 4-24 hours of NMP (n = 85) or 2-3 hours of HOPE (n =&#xD;
      85) directly before implantation and going to be compared to a control-group of patients (n =&#xD;
      43) transplanted with static cold storage preserved ECD-allografts. Primary (surgical&#xD;
      complications as assessed by the comprehensive complication index [CCI]) and secondary (among&#xD;
      others laboratory values, graft- and patient survival, hospital costs, hospital stay)&#xD;
      endpoints are going to be analysed.)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation has evolved as the mainstay of treatment for end-stage liver disease.&#xD;
      While the demand for organ transplantation has increased over time, Germany's organ donation&#xD;
      rate is low compared to other countries. The main indications for listing are 'fibrosis and&#xD;
      cirrhosis' (27%) followed by 'alcoholic liver disease' (23%) and 'hepatic malignancies'&#xD;
      (17%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of emerging waiting list mortality, several strategies for donor pool&#xD;
      expansion are being pursued; these include the use of living donors, splitting of cadaveric&#xD;
      livers for two recipients, and the use of extended criteria donor (ECD) allografts for OLT.&#xD;
      These ECD-allografts, however, exhibit poor tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury,&#xD;
      an important cause of liver damage. As such, I/R-injury is the underlying cause of graft&#xD;
      dysfunction in ECD-allografts and negatively affects the process of liver regeneration in&#xD;
      surgical conditions including hepatic resections and OLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine perfusion with oxygenated blood was already implemented in the first series of 11&#xD;
      successful human OLTs in the 1960s. While the logistical simplicity and reliable performance&#xD;
      of CCS led to its quick adoption as the standard solid organ preservation technique, the&#xD;
      increased utilization of high-risk organs has unveiled the limitations of CCS, furthering the&#xD;
      debate on the impact of different MP techniques. Today, perfusion conditions vary broadly,&#xD;
      especially in preclinical research. Parameters under discussion include different&#xD;
      temperatures, perfusate composition, the application of perfusion flow (continuous or&#xD;
      pulsatile), the timing and duration of the perfusion, starting either at the donor site or&#xD;
      applied only end-ischemic in the recipient centre. Two main principles have been translated&#xD;
      into clinical practice today: hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) and normothermic MP&#xD;
      (NMP). The latter differs significantly from HOPE because the allograft is perfused with&#xD;
      oxygenated red blood cells or oxygen carriers at physiological temperatures with the aim to&#xD;
      reduce the ischemic graft injury by minimizing the duration of cold preservation and&#xD;
      perfectly mimicking physiological conditions. A recently completed randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) by Nasralla et al. proved the feasibility of NMP for OLT and demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant reduction in peak AST and subsequent early allograft dysfunction (EAD), however&#xD;
      without a significant difference in graft and patient survival. Most recently, a development&#xD;
      of the NMP technique that allowed a 7-day preservation of human livers with a sustained&#xD;
      metabolic function and an intact liver structure was recently reported by Eshmuminov et al.&#xD;
      Based on the sustained full hepatic metabolism during NMP, several groups are currently&#xD;
      exploring the possibility of normothermic viability testing. The cellular mechanisms of organ&#xD;
      protection by NMP do not center around IRI mitigation and reconditioning, but IRI prevention,&#xD;
      and are altogether different from cold perfusion techniques. While normothermic machine&#xD;
      perfusion is most effective when applied during the entire period of organ preservation, the&#xD;
      end-ischemic application of this technique in the recipient hospital is becoming more&#xD;
      popular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main hypotheses on the underlying mechanisms of HOPE induced organ protection;&#xD;
      (I.) modulation of cellular metabolism (energy household, mitochondrial respiration), and&#xD;
      (II.) stimulation of the sinusoidal endothelial layer. Although, tissue oxygen consumption is&#xD;
      markedly decreased at 4-10 Celsius, it is not completely suspended. The shift of&#xD;
      mitochondrial metabolism to anaerobic pathways leads to expressed mitochondrial metabolite&#xD;
      accumulation during ischemia and subsequently to extreme radical oxygen species (ROS)&#xD;
      generation through rapid re-oxidization by the early reperfusion respiratory burst. The&#xD;
      delivery of oxygen during cold preservation can effectively upload cellular energy household&#xD;
      via various mitochondrial pathways. Pre-implantation resuscitation of organs with machine&#xD;
      perfusion and oxygen can increase tissue ATP levels and decrease the post-ischemic production&#xD;
      of ROS and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), this subsequently leads to a&#xD;
      mitigated immune response. This organ conditioning effect is attributed to a controlled&#xD;
      re-oxygenation inducing moderate ROS release just before reperfusion. These low levels of ROS&#xD;
      are not only responsible for the induction of antioxidant enzymes (heme-oxygenase,&#xD;
      gluthathione-synthase, superoxide-dismutase), but are also responsible for the stimulation of&#xD;
      protein mediators of innate pro-survival mechanisms. A further mechanism behind the&#xD;
      protective effects of dynamic preservation approaches is the presence of shear stress and as&#xD;
      such active perfusion during the preservation phase may induce specific shear&#xD;
      stress-sensitive genes some of which include Kruppel-like factor 2 or endothelial nitric&#xD;
      oxide synthase. Currently, three multicenter RCTs have completed their patient recruitment&#xD;
      and clinical results are expected for the year 2021. The Zurich group initiated a&#xD;
      multicentric RCT to assess the impact of HOPE on any DBD liver graft including&#xD;
      retransplantations and marginal livers and is powered to assess major complications (Clavien&#xD;
      grade ≥III) (NCT01317342). The Groningen team explores the dual HOPE (d-HOPE) technique in&#xD;
      DCD grafts (NCT02584283) and our own group initiated a multicentric RCT on HOPE in ECD-DBD&#xD;
      liver transplantation in 2017 (NCT03124641).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viability assessment during MP can guide the clinical decision whether to accept a liver for&#xD;
      transplantation and is therefore an important emerging tool in ECD OLT. The possibility of a&#xD;
      reliable viability assessment is advocated as a considerable advantage of normothermic&#xD;
      perfusion techniques. By sustaining full metabolism, NMP allows to analyse several makers of&#xD;
      liver function and injury, including biliary parameters (e.g. bile flow, bile glucose,&#xD;
      bicarbonate and pH), perfusate pH and base excess, portal venous- and hepatic artery flow and&#xD;
      perfusate hepatocellular enzymes. Despite the reduced metabolic activity during cold storage&#xD;
      and hypothermic liver perfusion, there is increasing evidence that a prediction of future&#xD;
      graft performance after transplantation may be possible during HOPE, as well. Analysis of the&#xD;
      cold perfusate during HOPE provides a unique opportunity to identity potential biomarkers&#xD;
      which are associated with various post-OLT outcomes. A recent study involving 31 human&#xD;
      ECD-DBD grafts initially rejected for transplantation, found that cold perfusion not only&#xD;
      ameliorates reperfusion injury but also allows for graft viability assessment. Thus, the&#xD;
      2-hour perfusate AST and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) correlated significantly with the peak&#xD;
      AST after implantation. In two grafts with a significant postreperfusion transaminase&#xD;
      release, a high portal perfusion pressure was noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Zurich group has recently presented a new mitochondrial marker to assess viability of&#xD;
      entire liver grafts during HOPE. Real-time fluorometric analysis of mitochondrial flavin&#xD;
      mononucleotide (FMN) in the HOPE perfusate predicted human liver function, complications and&#xD;
      graft loss prior to transplantation. The use of this surrogate parameter could facilitate&#xD;
      proper clinical decision making whether to accept or decline allografts in the HOPE setting.&#xD;
      This marker is currently validated in other solid organs and also in the RCT of Guarerras&#xD;
      working group. Importantly, the quantification of FMN is possible in real time, requiring&#xD;
      only a spectroscope to reliably predict graft survival within the first 30-45 minutes of&#xD;
      HOPE. The clinical value and head-to-head comparison of various allograft viability&#xD;
      parameters in the HOPE vs. NMP setting has yet to be explored in the setting of a large&#xD;
      multicenter RCT. With the advent of clinical MP and the context of a dire donation situation&#xD;
      in the western world, it will be of utmost clinical importance to identify the most effective&#xD;
      dynamic preservation technique. While past and current clinical trials in DCD and DBD liver&#xD;
      transplantation were designed to compare different MP approaches with CCS as the clinical&#xD;
      standard, a direct comparison between different end-ischemic MP techniques (HOPE versus NMP)&#xD;
      is still lacking.&#xD;
