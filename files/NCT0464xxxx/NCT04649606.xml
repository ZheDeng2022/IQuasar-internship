&#xD;
               3. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth&#xD;
                  in this clinical protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. The subject must agree not to participate in other clinical research for the&#xD;
                  duration of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. The subject's optimal spherical equivalent distance refraction must be between&#xD;
                  +1.00 and -2.00 D in each eye&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. The subject's refractive cylinder must be ≤-1.00 DC in each eye&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. The subject must score less than 4 points (inclusive) in SPEED questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
