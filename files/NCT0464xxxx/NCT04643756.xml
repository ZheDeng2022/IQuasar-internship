  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned to examine the effects of two different treatment programs on pain&#xD;
      intensity, back awareness, functional and psychosocial factors in patients with chronic low&#xD;
      back pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent study will be carried out on volunteer patients who applied to the Physical Therapy&#xD;
      Clinic of &quot;Mugla Sitki Kocman University&quot; Training and Research Hospital, who were diagnosed&#xD;
      with chronic non-specific low back pain and who comply with the study criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size has been calculated that 80% power can be obtained at 95% confidence level.&#xD;
      It was found that at least 21 cases, a total of 44 cases, were required for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be divided into 2 groups by randomization. Conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      applications will be applied to the control group. In addition to conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      methods, kinesio-taping (KT) will be applied to the study group. Patients in both groups will&#xD;
      be treated 5 days a week for a total of 10 sessions for 2 weeks. KT will be renewed in each&#xD;
      session on weekdays.&#xD;

    <description>Classical electrotherapy method consisting of tens, hotpack and ultrasound. Procedure/Device: Conventional Physiotherapy Conventional Physiotherapy consist of Hotpacks, TENS and US.The participants were positioned in prone and supported with a pillow under the abdomen, 20 min hot pack was applied. Therapatic Ultrason were applied with the frequency of 1 MHz, intensity of 1,5 watt/cm2 and duration of 5 minute. TENS was applied to the lumbar region with 2-channel, 4 surface electrodes at 60-120 Hz, and 50-100 pulse duration for 20 minutes.</description>

    <description>Kinesiotaping application in addition to classical electrotherapy method consisting of tens, hotpack and ultrasound.It will be applied to reduce pain, increase proprioception and awareness. Kinesiotaping will be re-applicated every day. Space taping will be applied to the waist area. Space taping creates a vacuum effect on the skin, loosening the adhesions in the tissue layers. With this lifting effect, it creates a space under the skin, causing an increase in circulation and a decrease in pain. Four pieces of I-tape will be used for taping. The middle point of the first tape will be attached with maximum tension. The ends of the tape will be tensionless. The second tape will also be applied at a 90 degree angle. The third and fourth tapes will be taped at an angle of 45 degrees.</description>
