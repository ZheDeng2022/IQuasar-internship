  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) affects 200,000 Canadians and increases risk of stroke, morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Having a stroke can affect a patient's ability to speak, eat, walk, work, care&#xD;
      for themselves, and interact with others. Not only can it ruin one's life, but it can also be&#xD;
      fatal. A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a clot, depriving brain&#xD;
      cells of oxygen. In people with atrial fibrillation, blood flow is sluggish in the top&#xD;
      chambers of the heart, and blood clots can form there. When a piece of a clot breaks off, it&#xD;
      can travel to the brain and cause a stroke. That's where blood thinners come in. Blood&#xD;
      thinners, or anticoagulants, decrease the chances of blood clots forming in the heart,&#xD;
      reducing the risk of stroke. Studies show that blood thinners are highly effective at&#xD;
      reducing the risk of stroke by up to 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional blood thinner is warfarin, taken by mouth. Warfarin requires regular blood&#xD;
      tests to make sure a patient getting the correct dose. The patient also may have to avoid&#xD;
      certain foods since the medication can interact with them. Newer blood thinners, known as&#xD;
      direct-oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are available, which do not require regular blood tests&#xD;
      and do not interact with foods. Two of the new blood thinners are called rivaroxaban and&#xD;
      apixaban. Like warfarin, they can be taken by mouth, and studies have shown them to be as&#xD;
      effective as warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both rivaroxaban and apixaban have been approved for stroke prevention in AF by Health&#xD;
      Canada. However, there have been no direct head-to-head comparisons of these two&#xD;
      anticoagulants, meaning comparative safety data is not available. Increasing use of DOACs for&#xD;
      stroke prevention in AF and patient values around bleeding highlight the need for a&#xD;
      comparison trial to ensure patients receive the anticoagulant with the greatest balance of&#xD;
      benefit to potential harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is to assess bleeding rates and superiority of using apixaban versus rivaroxaban in&#xD;
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
