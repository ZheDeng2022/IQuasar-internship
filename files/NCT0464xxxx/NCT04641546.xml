  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a registered and licensed occupational therapist, I completed a six-week evidence based&#xD;
      research study to determine the effects of occupation-based intervention and therapeutic&#xD;
      exercises versus therapeutic exercises alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Importance: There is a need for evidence to support occupation-based intervention (OBI) for&#xD;
      older adults with shoulder osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of OBI on function in older adults with shoulder OA&#xD;
      compared to therapeutic exercise (TE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized controlled trial. Six-week intervention. 1-week and 4-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Outpatient clinic. Participants: Ten older adults with diagnosis of shoulder OA via&#xD;
      convenience sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants were seen two times/week for six weeks. The OBI group completed 30&#xD;
      minutes of TE followed by 30 minutes of OBI. The TE group completed 60 minutes of TE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome and Measures: Functional outcomes were assessed at pre-, 1-week post, and 4-weeks&#xD;
      posttreatment using the QuickDASH as the primary outcome measure.&#xD;
