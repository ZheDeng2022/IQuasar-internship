  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capecitabine combined with pyrotinib is the standard protocol for HR+/HER2+ advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer after trastuzumab failure, but the incidence of grade 3 hand-foot-syndrome was 16.4%.&#xD;
      Therefore, the search for efficient and low toxicity alternatives has become a research&#xD;
      hotspot. Our previous basic studies have shown that ER inhibitor fulvestrant and HER2&#xD;
      inhibitor pyrotinib have a synergistic effect. The preliminary analysis of our prospective&#xD;
      shows that the efficacy is close to that of capecitabine combined with pyrotinib, and the&#xD;
      adverse events are significantly improved compared with capecitabine combined with pyrotinib.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is necessary to further carry out a head-to-head phase III randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial to study the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant combined with&#xD;
      pyrotinib in the treatment of HR + / HER2 + advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hormone receptor (HR) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) positive&#xD;
      breast cancer has the characteristics of mild biological behavior and slow progression.&#xD;
      Currently, capecitabine combined with pyrotinib is the standard protocol for this kind of&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer after trastuzumab failure, and the median progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) is 11.0 months. The incidence of grade 3 hand-foot-syndrome was 16.4%, the incidence of&#xD;
      grade 3 diarrhea was 30.6%, and the incidence of grade 3 myelosuppression was 6%. Therefore,&#xD;
      the search for efficient and low toxicity alternatives has become a research hotspot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous basic studies have shown that ER inhibitor fulvestrant and HER2 inhibitor&#xD;
      pyrotinib have synergistic effect in inhibiting the proliferation of HR + / HER2 + breast&#xD;
      cancer cells. At the same time, the preliminary analysis of our prospective, phase II, single&#xD;
      arm study of &quot;Fulvestrant combined with Pyrotinib in the treatment of HR + / HER2 + advanced&#xD;
      breast cancer&quot; shows that the efficacy is close to that of capecitabine combined with&#xD;
      pyrotinib (median progression free survival is more than 13 months), and the adverse events&#xD;
      are significantly improved compared with capecitabine combined with pyrotinib (grade 3&#xD;
      hand-foot-syndrome). This project has been supported by the &quot;Sun-yat sun clinical research&#xD;
      and cultivation project&quot; of Sun-Yat Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun-Yat Sen University. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is necessary to further carry out a head-to-head phase III randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial to study the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant combined with pyrotinib in the&#xD;
      treatment of HR + / HER2 + advanced breast cancer, with a non-inferiority cut-off value of HR&#xD;
      = 1.30. Combined with the analysis of biomarkers, to find the molecular indicators to predict&#xD;
      the benefit of pyrotinib combined with endocrine therapy, so as to provide theoretical basis&#xD;
      for guiding precise treatment.&#xD;
