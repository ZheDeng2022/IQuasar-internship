  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CPSP is common after cardiac surgery. The reported incidence was 28% to 56% up to 2 years&#xD;
      postoperatively. Despite a large number of cross-sectional and retrospective studies,&#xD;
      prospective cohort studies examining the incidence of chronic post-sternotomy pain following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery have been scarce, and none on our local Chinese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several mechanisms have been involved in the development of chronic pain after sternotomy.&#xD;
      Ongoing pain after surgery can continue to sensitize the nociceptive fibres which may&#xD;
      subsequently lead to hyperalgesia, hyperpathia, allodynia and dysesthesia. In addition, like&#xD;
      any form of chronic pain, it is a multidimensional process involving social, cognitive and&#xD;
      psychological factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPSP has the potential to impact daily functioning and quality of life of patients, as well&#xD;
      as increasing the healthcare costs. To date, only the CARDpain study examined the role of&#xD;
      social and psychological risk factors in development of CPSP after cardiac surgery. They&#xD;
      found pre-surgical anxiety, measured by the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), was&#xD;
      a significant risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to examine the incidence of chronic post-sternotomy pain at 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months following cardiac surgery in local Chinese population, and identify the&#xD;
      clinical and psychological risk factors associated with its development. The secondary aim is&#xD;
      to determine the impact of CPSP on the quality of life following cardiac surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain that persists beyond the normal time for tissue healing is increasingly&#xD;
      recognized as an important complication after various types of surgery. According to the&#xD;
      International Association for Study of Pain (IASP), chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is&#xD;
      defined as the persistence of pain at surgical site or referred area, at least 3 months&#xD;
      following the surgical procedure1. CPSP is common after cardiac surgery. The reported&#xD;
      incidence was 28% to 56% up to 2 years postoperatively. The wide range of reported incidence&#xD;
      seems to result from heterogenicity of the study population and the study design. McGillion&#xD;
      MH et al reviewed that cross-sectional and retrospective studies have generally reported&#xD;
      higher prevalence for CPSP (14-56%) after cardiac surgery than those investigations with&#xD;
      prospective designs (7.5-45%). Despite a large number of cross-sectional and retrospective&#xD;
      studies, prospective cohort studies examining the incidence of chronic post-sternotomy pain&#xD;
      following cardiac surgery have been scarce, and none on our local Chinese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several mechanisms have been involved in the development of chronic pain after sternotomy.&#xD;
      These include dissection, nerve entrapment by sternal wires, sternal retraction which can&#xD;
      dislocate and fractured ribs, and intercostal neuralgia as a consequence of nerve damage&#xD;
      during dissection of the internal mammary artery during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).&#xD;
      All can stimulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines which sensitize the afferent&#xD;
      nociceptive fibres to cause chronic pain. Ongoing pain after surgery can continue to&#xD;
      sensitize the nociceptive fibres which may subsequently lead to hyperalgesia, hyperpathia,&#xD;
      allodynia and dysesthesia. In addition, like any form of chronic pain, it is a&#xD;
      multidimensional process involving social, cognitive and psychological factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPSP has the potential to impact daily functioning and quality of life of patients, as well&#xD;
      as increasing the healthcare costs. CARDpain study reported that among those with CPSP, over&#xD;
      50% had significant pain-related interference with activities of daily living (family and&#xD;
      home responsibilities, recreation and employment) at 3, 6 and 12 months following cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. Identification of risk factors associated with the development of CPSP could&#xD;
      potentially improve outcomes among high-risk patients, especially if the risk factors are&#xD;
      modifiable. To date, only the CARDpain study examined the role of social and psychological&#xD;
      risk factors in development of CPSP after cardiac surgery. They found pre-surgical anxiety,&#xD;
      measured by the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), was a significant risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of our study is to examine the incidence of chronic post-sternotomy pain at 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months following cardiac surgery in our local Chinese population, and identify&#xD;
      the clinical and psychological risk factors associated with its development. The secondary&#xD;
      aim is to determine the impact of CPSP on the quality of life following cardiac surgery.&#xD;
