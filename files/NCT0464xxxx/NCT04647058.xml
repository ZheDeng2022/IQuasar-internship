      Functional motor recovery distal to a peripheral nerve lesion is predicated upon time to&#xD;
      reinnervation of the motor end plate and the number of regenerate axons that reach the&#xD;
      target. Supercharged end-to-side (SETS) transfer of the anterior interosseous nerve to the&#xD;
      motor fascicle of the ulnar nerve at the level of the distal forearm has been proposed as an&#xD;
      adjunct procedure in severe cubital tunnel syndrome to augment motor recovery of the&#xD;
      ulnar-innervated intrinsic muscles. Multiple Level IV Therapeutic studies and a systematic&#xD;
      review of Level IV Therapeutic studies have reported favorable clinical and electrodiagnostic&#xD;
      outcomes following SETS for cubital tunnel syndrome, with low rates of complications.&#xD;
      However, in the absence of controls, it remains unclear what proportion of the observed&#xD;
      intrinsic motor recovery is attributable to the SETS procedure. The objective of this&#xD;
      randomized trial is to compare the results of ulnar nerve decompression with or without SETS&#xD;
      for severe cubital tunnel syndrome.&#xD;

      Null hypothesis: Ulnar nerve decompression with or without supercharged end-to-side (SETS)&#xD;
      anterior interosseous nerve transfer for McGowan classification stage III cubital tunnel&#xD;
      syndrome results in similar ulnar intrinsic motor recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Functional motor recovery distal to a peripheral nerve lesion is predicated upon&#xD;
      time to reinnervation of the motor end plate and the number of regenerate axons that reach&#xD;
      the target. Supercharged end-to-side (SETS) transfer of the anterior interosseous nerve to&#xD;
      the motor fascicle of the ulnar nerve at the level of the distal forearm has been proposed as&#xD;
      an adjunct procedure in severe cubital tunnel syndrome to augment motor recovery of the&#xD;
      ulnar-innervated intrinsic muscles. The proposed mechanism of action of SETS is twofold: (1)&#xD;
      &quot;babysitting&quot; the motor end plates until native regenerate axons reach their target, and (2)&#xD;
      augmented partial recovery through axonal growth through the new pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Level IV Therapeutic studies and a systematic review of Level IV Therapeutic studies&#xD;
      have reported favorable clinical and electrodiagnostic outcomes following SETS for cubital&#xD;
      tunnel syndrome, with low rates of complications. However, in the absence of controls, it&#xD;
      remains unclear what proportion of the observed intrinsic motor recovery is attributable to&#xD;
      the SETS procedure. Koriem et al. recently published a prospective, randomized comparative&#xD;
      study of ulnar nerve repair with or without SETS for proximal ulnar nerve injuries and&#xD;
      demonstrated superior intrinsic recovery and claw correction with the SETS procedure.&#xD;
      Prospective, randomized trials of SETS for severe cubital tunnel syndrome are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the results of ulnar nerve decompression with or&#xD;
      without SETS for severe cubital tunnel syndrome. In this study, severe cubital tunnel&#xD;
      syndrome is defined as McGowan classification stage III disease (sensory deficits, motor&#xD;
      deficits, and the presence of intrinsic atrophy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patient Selection A prospective, randomized controlled trial will be conducted at two&#xD;
      participating institutions: Brigham and Women's Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical&#xD;
      Center. Inclusion criteria are patients 18 years of age or older indicated for surgical&#xD;
      treatment of severe cubital tunnel syndrome at one of the two participating institutions.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria furthermore includes a preoperative nerve conduction study and&#xD;
      electromyography documenting ulnar neuropathy at the elbow with present fibrillations and&#xD;
      positive sharp waves in the FDI or ADM within one year of surgery. Severe cubital tunnel&#xD;
      syndrome is defined in this study as McGowan classification stage IIB or III disease (sensory&#xD;
      deficits, motor deficits, and the presence of intrinsic atrophy). Exclusion criteria include&#xD;
      ulnar nerve transections, traumatic brachial plexus injuries, brachial plexus neuritis (e.g.&#xD;
      Parsonage-Turner), cervical radiculopathy, primary motor neuropathy (e.g.&#xD;
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth), prior cubital tunnel surgery, and oncologic etiologies of ulnar nerve&#xD;
      compression. Exclusion criteria additionally include patients who are not capable of&#xD;
      decision-making or are unable to understand the study procedures. Non-English speaking&#xD;
      patients are excluded since our secondary outcome variables may not have been translated and&#xD;
      validated in other language(s). Comorbid carpal tunnel syndrome, concomitant carpal tunnel&#xD;
      release, comorbid diabetes mellitus, and internervous connections such as Martin-Gruber&#xD;
      connections are not criteria for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Patients included in this study will be randomly assigned to the SETS group or&#xD;
      the control group with a 1:1 enrollment ratio. A computerized random number generator will be&#xD;
      used for allocation, which will be concealed by sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque&#xD;
      envelopes opened after patient consent and enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment The control group will undergo cubital tunnel release in situ. In cases of&#xD;
      preoperative or intraoperative ulnar nerve instability, anterior transposition of the ulnar&#xD;
      nerve will be performed. A soft dressing will be applied for in situ decompressions. A&#xD;
      posterior elbow plaster splint will be used for anterior transpositions for 2 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      will receive formal occupational therapy for scar massage, range of motion, and progressive&#xD;
      intrinsic strengthening starting at 2 weeks postoperatively for 6 weeks duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SETS group will undergo the same procedure as described above, with the addition of the&#xD;
      SETS procedure as previously described.1 Decompression of Guyon's canal during the SETS&#xD;
      procedure is at the discretion of the treating surgeon. In addition to the aforementioned&#xD;
      elbow dressing, a neutral wrist splint will be used for 2 weeks. Patients will receive formal&#xD;
      occupational therapy for scar massage, range of motion, and motor re-education consisting of&#xD;
      repetitive forearm pronation exercises starting at 2 weeks postoperatively for 6 weeks&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subterminal key pinch strength (kg) - continuous Time points: 0, 3 months, 6 months, 12&#xD;
      months, 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-Rated Ulnar Nerve Evaluation (PRUNE) score - continuous, non-parametric Disabilities&#xD;
      of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score - continuous, non-parametric MRC forearm pronation&#xD;
      strength in elbow flexion and extension - ordinal, non-parametric Time points: 0, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, 12 months, 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanatory variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age - continuous, non-parametric Sex - dichotomous Dominant hand - dichotomous BMI -&#xD;
      continuous, parametric Diabetes mellitus - dichotomous Smoking status - dichotomous Worker's&#xD;
      Compensation status - dichotomous Duration of symptoms at presentation (months) - continuous,&#xD;
      non-parametric Preoperative NCS SNAP - continuous, parametric Preoperative NCS CMAP -&#xD;
      continuous, parametric Guyon's canal decompression - dichotomous&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis An a priori power calculation was performed. Assuming a 1:1 enrollment&#xD;
      ratio and a mean subterminal key pinch strength of 4 kg (standard deviation 1 kg), a sample&#xD;
      size of 32 (16 patients in each group) has 80% power to detect a 1 kg difference in&#xD;
      subterminal key pinch strength between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the study cohorts. The student's t-test will be&#xD;
      used to compare the primary outcome variable and the Mann-Whitney U test will be used to&#xD;
      compare the secondary outcome variables between the SETS group and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use bivariate analysis to screen for factors associated with poorer&#xD;
      outcome in the SETS group and in the control group. Variables that meet our inclusion&#xD;
      criteria (p &lt; 0.1) will be included in a multiple regression model to assess for independent&#xD;
      factors associated with poorer outcomes following the study procedures.&#xD;
