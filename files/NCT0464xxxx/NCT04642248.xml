    <textblock>
      At a basic level, running-related injuries (RRI) occur because the forces acting on the body&#xD;
      exceed the capacity of the tissue to absorb the forces causing a breakdown of the tissue.&#xD;
      When looking at ways to reduce RRI, the general strategy should be to make the body's ability&#xD;
      to absorb forces greater than the forces acting on it. This can be accomplished by improving&#xD;
      flexibility, increasing strength, reducing participation, improving recovery, and finally&#xD;
      improving running form through gait retraining. Due to constraints of research by the ability&#xD;
      to get large enough data sets, most literature has looked at one of these ways to make the&#xD;
      forces manageable for a runner, while there are many ways. Running is not the only time that&#xD;
      the body absorbs forces. This is especially true in a military population where there is a&#xD;
      cumulative effect of forces from marching with heavy load, prolonged standing, and limited&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait retraining has been shown to reduce injury rates by as much as 60%. Two studies have&#xD;
      looked specifically at military populations to show that gait retraining can be effective for&#xD;
      reducing a common injury in the shin. Military studies have also shown that gait retraining&#xD;
      is transferable to wearing boots, even when the gait retraining is done in shoes. In the&#xD;
      commercial sector, many studies have shown the benefit of changing running form with cadence&#xD;
      modification, increasing forward lean, reducing collapsing at the knee, and modifying the&#xD;
      position of the foot when the foot hits the ground. The aim of this study is taking the best&#xD;
      evidence from gait retraining efforts and personalize the methodology to the individual&#xD;
      runner. No study to date has provided individual recommendations for gait retraining, nor has&#xD;
      the capabilities to do so that this portable 3D motion analysis system provides. The results&#xD;
      can be used on a large scale to have a significant reduction in RRI and a monumental benefit&#xD;
      to society.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total project will last 12 months, with 3 months to prepare testing facilities and train&#xD;
      personnel, 6 months to analyze enough subjects for statistical power, and 3 months of&#xD;
      statistical analysis and review. Between three to eleven Air Force Reserve bases with a&#xD;
      Developmental Training Flight (DTF) will be given a RunDNA 3D Motion Analysis system to&#xD;
      participate as testing facilities. The DTF is part of the Air Force Reserves where new&#xD;
      recruits undergo education and training prior to BMT. Three to five Exercise Physiologists at&#xD;
      each DTF base will be trained on how to perform the RunDNA analysis. Training will be done&#xD;
      remotely, which has already successfully been done through video-based lectures at 6 Air&#xD;
      Force bases. Each research examiner will pass a test and must submit a 3D analysis done with&#xD;
      the RunDNA device prior to testing for standardization of procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each DTF has upwards of 100 military recruits who are preparing to attend BMT at any given&#xD;
      time. Recruits will undergo baseline fitness testing when they are within 16 weeks of&#xD;
      attending BMT. Fitness testing is comprised of a timed mile and a half run, two-minute timed&#xD;
      pushup test, and two-minute timed sit up test. Three days or less after Fitness Testing (once&#xD;
      any soreness has resolved), the recruits will undergo the RunDNA Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RunDNA analysis consists of a Running Readiness Assessment (RRA) to determine mobility&#xD;
      and strength and a 3D gait analysis to assess running form. The RRA is comprised of thirteen&#xD;
      movement-based assessments that are scored with specific criteria for each test. The tests&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Toe Touch&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Back Bend&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rotation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Single Leg Balance - Eyes Closed&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Squat&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Single leg sit to stand&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Unilateral Hip Bridge Endurance Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Single Leg Calf Raise&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Side Plank&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Toe Splay&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Hallux Extension&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Hallux Abduction&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Ankle Range of Motion Items 1 through 5 have additional break downs to further identify&#xD;
           limitations in movement and prescribe specific corrective exercise programs. DTF site&#xD;
           personnel will enter the RRA results into the RunDNA mobile app at the time of&#xD;
           administration. A scoring system has been created for a total of 55 points, where 1&#xD;
           point is given for a strength limitation, 2 points for a mobility limitation, and 3&#xD;
           points for painful movement. Each runner will be given a score from their RRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3D running analysis will use a portable device mounted on a tripod five feet behind a&#xD;
      treadmill. There are 3 optical motion capture cameras with LED lights in each device.&#xD;
      Eighteen reflective markers will be adhered to each runner using the modified Helen Hayes&#xD;
      protocol. Runners will be given a minimum of 2 minutes to warm up, and then 15 seconds of&#xD;
      running will be captured. After the quality of the 3D capture has been verified, each runner&#xD;
      will be assigned a running category determined by the software. The software will communicate&#xD;
      the running category with the mobile app and the groups that are being prescribed exercises&#xD;
      will have those programs added to their profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants (recruits) will also fill out information on demographics, running&#xD;
      experience, and injury history under their profile in the mobile application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will randomly assigning which participants will be getting the intervention&#xD;
      program at the DTF sites to prescribe personalized programs based off the RunDNA analysis.&#xD;
      Examiners will assign the program based off of the user id that is generate, where odds will&#xD;
      be give the intervention and evens will not. The prescription of the programs is standardized&#xD;
      by using the mobile app to analyze the runner's results and prescribe one corrective exercise&#xD;
      program from the RRA, one gait category program, and one fitness training program. The gait&#xD;
      category program will be one of twelve programs that classify runners after the software&#xD;
      analyzes all running variables. Each category has specific warm up exercises, specific&#xD;
      drills, and specific gait retraining methods to lower the risk of injury for runners by&#xD;
      improving their form. An example category is an overstrider cadence program. This person&#xD;
      lands with the foot too far in front of the body because they have a slow step rate. The&#xD;
      overstrider cadence program includes a dynamic warm up, drills using a higher step rate, and&#xD;
      gait retraining where the runner matches their footsteps to a metronome that is 5-10% higher&#xD;
      than their self-selected step rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruits will go through a minimum of 8 weeks of training at DTF using the mobile app and GPS&#xD;
      watches to track compliance and training loads. The training program utilizes motor learning&#xD;
      principles to gradually increase the time a runner uses the new form with faded feedback to&#xD;
      allow for a natural adoption of the running technique. Cross training is included for&#xD;
      cardiovascular fitness, as well as speed work for running in the later stages of the program&#xD;
      to improve performance. Within 2 weeks of the recruit going to BMT, site personnel will&#xD;
      readminister the Fitness Tests and RunDNA Analysis using the same procedures listed above to&#xD;
      monitor changes in fitness, mobility, strength, and running form. Results will be recorded in&#xD;
      the RunDNA app for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruits will be monitored through the mobile application during BMT to assess Fitness&#xD;
      Test performance, injury rates, utilization of medical services, graduation rate, and&#xD;
      subjective pain and fatigue reports. Recruits will continue to wear the GPS device to track&#xD;
      training load. A daily subjective questionnaire will be filled out by the recruits on their&#xD;
      issued iPad reporting on injury status and syncing the watch's training data. If iPads are&#xD;
      not available to use the RunDNA app for each recruit, an analogue journal will be provided&#xD;
      that has their research subject number in the journal. Each recruit will be given their&#xD;
      subject number to know which journal is theirs. At the end of BMT the journals will be mailed&#xD;
      to be manually entered. If iPads are not available to use the RunDNA app, multiple iPads will&#xD;
      be sent to the medical staff at BMT and participants will come in twice weekly to sync their&#xD;
      GPS device with the iPad to load up training data from the GPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no change in training plans from standard BMT protocols for recruits doing&#xD;
      through this research study. If at any point a recruit experiences injury or requests medical&#xD;
      attention the BMT medical staff will alert the Principle Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done on all results to answer the primary research question,&#xD;
      with the anticipation of identifying key modifiable variables related to running injuries in&#xD;
      the control group and the intervention group's ability to reduce injury rates and boost&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
