  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that causes&#xD;
      moderate pain in the early postoperative period. In this prospective randomized study, the&#xD;
      efficacy of four-quadrant and two-quadrant laparoscopic-assisted transversus abdominis plane&#xD;
      (LTAP) block on postoperative pain will be compared with that of only intravenous analgesia&#xD;
      (SA) and port-site infiltration of local anesthetic (LA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing elective LC will be divided into four groups of 40 patients each using a&#xD;
      randomization scale. The standard analgesia group will receive LTAP block with normal saline&#xD;
      (NS) and port-site infiltration of NS, the LA group will receive LTAP block with NS and&#xD;
      port-site infiltration of bupivacaine, while the four and two quadrant LTAP group will&#xD;
      receive the block with bupivacaine and port-site infiltration of NS. Postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      will be administered to all groups as a standard procedure. The patients' demographic data,&#xD;
      postoperative 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24-hour visual analog pain (VAS) scores at rest and on cough,&#xD;
      opioid requirement, presence of nausea and vomiting, and satisfaction scores will record in a&#xD;
      standard form. The statistical analysis will be carried out using the SPSS software and the&#xD;
      level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

      This prospective, randomized, controlled, observer and patient-blind study will be conducted&#xD;
      by the General Surgery, Anesthesiology and Reanimation Departments of Private Medicabil&#xD;
      Hospital in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines. Hospital ethics committee approval was obtained for the study and the study was&#xD;
      conducted between january 2021 and april 2020. Informed consent for the study to be conducted&#xD;
      will obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The study will included American Society Anesthesia&#xD;
      (ASA) 1 and 2 patients aged 18-70 years who underwent conventional four-quadrant LC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who did not agree to participate in the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ASA 3 and above patients, those who will undergone emergency surgery, open&#xD;
           cholecystectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BMI of &gt;40,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. İntraoperative major complications,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. History of severe allergy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Chronic analgesic use, Study Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. gender, age, presence of comorbidity, weight, height, smoking status, operative time,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, intraoperative fluid volume, and developed complications 2. the&#xD;
      primary data of the study: the postoperative 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24-hour VAS scores (0 lowest-10&#xD;
      highest) at rest and on cough after surgery 3. the rate of rescue analgesic dose of tramadol&#xD;
      4. as the secondary data: nausea-vomiting, shoulder pain, discharge duration exceeding 24&#xD;
      hours, and pre-discharge patient satisfaction (strongly disagree 1-strongly agree 5 on a&#xD;
      Likert-type scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean postoperative 1-hour Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores and the rates of rescue&#xD;
      analgesic use of 20 patients operated before the study were determined. With these values, it&#xD;
      was calculated that there should be 40 patients in each group, with a 33% decrease in pain&#xD;
      scores and rescue analgesic use after LTAP at a statistical power of 80% and a significance&#xD;
      level of 5%. The study was conducted with 30 patients in each group for a better analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will be performed immediately before the surgery using a&#xD;
      computer-generated random number table and was reported to the surgeon who would perform the&#xD;
      surgery. Anesthesia team, the patient, and the clinical nurses who carry out and record the&#xD;
      postoperative evaluation will blinded to the group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and Study Groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study groups were planned as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (Standard IV analgesia group (SA), n=40):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (Local analgesia group (LA), n=40):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 (Four qudrant-Laparoscopic-assisted transversus abdominis plane block (LTAP) group,&#xD;
      n=40) Postoperative analgesic administration will be carried out following a standard&#xD;
      protocol in all groups. Acetaminophen 1 g was gradually will administered every 6 hours&#xD;
      depending on the level of pain, and diclofenac sodium will intravenously administered every&#xD;
      12 hours depending on the requirement. In the case of a pain score above 4, tramadol 100 mg&#xD;
      will be given intravenously as a rescue analgesic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the induction of anesthesia, the first port was inserted through the umbilicus and a 12&#xD;
      mmHg pneumoperitoneum was established as a standard. Under the direct view of the&#xD;
      laparoscopic camera, the block was performed by inserting a 22-G needle just above the iliac&#xD;
      crest through the midclavicular line posteriorly into the triangle of Petit and then&#xD;
      inserting the needle below the costal arch through the midclavicular line towards the&#xD;
      anterior axillary line into the subcostal plane. The block needle was advanced under direct&#xD;
      view until the two pops were felt and the extraperitoneal space was reached without&#xD;
      puncturing the parietal peritoneum, and pulling back the needle 0.5 cm, the area of the thin&#xD;
      transversus abdominis muscle fibers was infiltrated. In this area, the correct plane of the&#xD;
      needle tip was confirmed by observing Doyle's bulge and the spread of the local&#xD;
      anesthetic.11,14 This procedure was performed as the bilateral four-quadrant block in BLTAP&#xD;
      group and right sided two-quadrant block in ULTAP group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The SPSS (IBM SPSS, version20) software will be used for the statistical&#xD;
      analysis. The t-test was will use for continuous variables, while the chi-square test for&#xD;
      categorical values. The level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
