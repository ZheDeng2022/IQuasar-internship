    <textblock>
      When assessing an injured child, doctors must decide whether or not there is an underlying&#xD;
      bone fracture. The best way of doing this is to take an x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011, the 46,000 children attending Sheffield Children's Hospital Emergency Department had&#xD;
      10,400 x-rays mainly to help diagnose fractures. Taking just the foot and wrist, 2,215 x-rays&#xD;
      were normal with no fracture, at a cost of £119,610 for the Sheffield community alone (at&#xD;
      tariff £54 per x-ray). This works out as a cost of approximately £12 million per year across&#xD;
      England and Wales. Additionally, although the radiation dose is quite small, given that&#xD;
      x-rays can cause cancer, no radiation is better than some radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fracture screening method is needed that will help doctors, schoolteachers and others more&#xD;
      reliably decide which children should have an x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibration is reliably used in industry to find defects such as cracks in machines and other&#xD;
      structures. The researchers believe that vibration can similarly find fractures in bones in&#xD;
      children. The team has recently demonstrated the ability of vibration to correctly pick the 3&#xD;
      x-ray confirmed cases out of 13 adults who had a wrist fracture (7 healthy adults and 6 with&#xD;
      wrist injury). None of the 6 injured adults felt that vibration would be too painful to use&#xD;
      on injured children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal is now to compare the vibration patterns of the bones of about 150 children over&#xD;
      10 years of age attending the researchers' Emergency Department with their fracture positive&#xD;
      or fracture negative x-rays. The researchers also propose to assess any differences in the&#xD;
      vibration patterns between left and right wrist and ankles in 50 healthy school children with&#xD;
      no injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should vibration analysis for fracture screening prove sufficiently accurate, further larger&#xD;
      studies shall be conducted, with the aim of developing an instrument that will reduce the&#xD;
      number of injured children having unnecessary x-rays. On completion of this study, the plan&#xD;
      is to extend the study to include younger children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will lead to cost savings for the NHS and less inconvenience for patients and their&#xD;
      families, with shorter stays in Emergency Departments and reduced population exposure to&#xD;
      harmful ionising radiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main research question underpinning this pilot study is, &quot;Can vibration spectra reliably&#xD;
      distinguish fractured from non-fractured bones in children?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant number of unnecessary radiographs are performed to exclude the presence of&#xD;
      fractures. In 2011, 46,000 children attended Sheffield Children's Hospital Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED), for whom 10,400 radiographs were performed. 2,215 foot/ankle and wrist&#xD;
      radiographs alone proved unnecessary. This translates to a potential cost saving of&#xD;
      £119,610/year in Sheffield and approximately £12M/year in England and Wales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clearly there is the need for a non-invasive, portable, cheap and rapid method of screening&#xD;
      long bones for fractures to establish the probability of whether the bone is fracture&#xD;
      negative or positive; those with a high probability of fracture then going on to be&#xD;
      radiographed, to establish presence, type and position of fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Possible Solution:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibration analysis involves the mechanical excitation of an object, then recording and&#xD;
      analysing the subsequent responses . When a structure is allowed to move freely after an&#xD;
      excitation, it will vibrate at its specific natural frequencies where the inertial forces are&#xD;
      in balance with the elastic forces, depending upon the stiffness of that structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibration spectral analysis is reliably used in industry to detect cracks in machinery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers tested the hypothesis that fractured and non-fractured bones return different&#xD;
      vibration spectra on 13 adults; 7 healthy volunteers from the Engineering Department of&#xD;
      Sheffield Hallam University and 6 patients following injury at Northern General Hospital, 3&#xD;
      of whom had fractures , with 100% correlation of vibration spectra with presence/absence of&#xD;
      fracture and no pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these encouraging results, the proposal is to extend the study to children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Theory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers postulate that there are detectable differences in the natural vibration&#xD;
      frequencies obtained from bones with and without fracture. Each child's uninjured&#xD;
      contralateral bone will serve as a comparison for the injured side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of vibration analysis involves mechanical excitation of an object and&#xD;
      recording and analysing the subsequent responses. In theory, by applying a stimulus to the&#xD;
      bone and analysing the resulting response, it is possible to monitor various pathological and&#xD;
      trauma-induced conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibrations may be induced either by an impulse, which yields a response consistent with the&#xD;
      inputting of a number of independent fundamental frequencies, or by variable frequency cycles&#xD;
      of pure sine waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having induced the vibrations by a small purpose-built computer-controlled tapper, the&#xD;
      commonest method of recording them uses piezoelectric gauges on bony prominences (minimising&#xD;
      the effect of underlying soft tissue). For example, when analysing tibial fracture healing,&#xD;
      the lateral or medial malleolus are prime sites . Successful operation of piezoelectric&#xD;
      gauges depends on the coupling of the gauge to the structure under investigation, such that&#xD;
      the induced stresses produce a net change in charge of the transducer terminals due to the&#xD;
      piezoelectric effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Piezoelectric crystals are relatively inexpensive and their properties well understood. Both&#xD;
      piezoresistive and piezoelectric materials are commonly used to detect strain caused by&#xD;
      vibrations in macro-scale structures. However, they often require challenging signal&#xD;
      processing and interpretation. The research group has experience working with complex medical&#xD;
      signals (e.g. electroencephalograms) to extract relevant information and will bring this&#xD;
      experience to bear in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous feasibility studies provide a sound basis for the proposed study. There is extensive&#xD;
      information on theory, techniques for vibration analysis of physical structures are well&#xD;
      established and furthermore, a number of studies have explored low-frequency vibration&#xD;
      analysis as a possible diagnostic tool in the orthopaedic field. For example, in one study it&#xD;
      was reported that the vibration transmission across a fracture is affected by the stages of&#xD;
      healing of the fracture callus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as the researchers are aware, no study has used the precise methodology proposed in&#xD;
      this current study to screen for fractures in children.&#xD;
