  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to enhance the effects of brain plasticity using a powerful noninvasive technique&#xD;
      for brain modulation consisting of navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) priming&#xD;
      with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with motor-training-like&#xD;
      constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the neurophysiologic findings of cortical plasticity.</measure>
    <time_frame>Before 10 sessions, before and after each session (every day), after 10 daily sessions and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Expressed as percent motor resting threshold and numerical values of motor evoked potential. The motor evoked potential (MEP) will be provided by twenty unconditioned stimuli (120% of motor resting threshould). The percentage of inhibition or facilitation for each before and after stimulation will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>To assess the motor function changes .</measure>
    <time_frame>before 10 sessions, before and after each session (every day), after 10 daily sessions and after 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change from motor hand function: ordinal variable measured through the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT). The JTHFT has seven subsets which are writing, simulated page-turning, lifting small objects, simulated feeding, stacking, and lifting large, lightweight, and heavy objects</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensory-motor function of the upper limb</measure>
    <time_frame>before 10 sessions, before and after each session (every day), after 10 daily sessions and after 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This consists of a quantitative scale developed to measure (motor recovery, balance, sensation, and some joint function) recovery of the motor function of stroke patients. Measured through the Fugl-Meyer Rating Scale, which expressed in values from 0 to 66.</description>

    <measure>Degree of disability:</measure>
    <time_frame>before 10 sessions, before and after each session (every day), after 10 daily sessions and after 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This consists of a quantitative scale developed to measured the disability caused by impairments in stroke patients. The Barthel Index Score (Activities of Daily Living) measured through ranges from 0 to 20, principally concerned with physical aspects of disability.</description>
