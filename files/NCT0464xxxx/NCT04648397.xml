  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the impact of speed of consumption of two starch-based foods&#xD;
      varying in fibre content on blood glucose levels in normal healthy subjects. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      mediating roles of salivary amylase and particle size on blood glucose levels will be&#xD;
      studied. The study has a randomized cross-over design. Subjects consume two test-lunches&#xD;
      (chick peas and brown rice) in duplicate on 8 different test days, at either long or short&#xD;
      chewing duration. Glucose responses will be monitored via a continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
      device and expectorated boluses will be collected during each test day for assessments of&#xD;
      amylase activity and food particle size.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research suggests that high glucose level variability and large dips in glucose levels may&#xD;
      have a negative impact on cognitive function and self-reported wellbeing. The way food is&#xD;
      consumed (e.g. chewing duration) may regulate blood glucose levels. The underlying mechanism&#xD;
      that links consumption speed to metabolic responses, satiation and health is largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the impact of speed of consumption of two starch-based foods&#xD;
      varying in fibre content, on blood glucose levels in normal healthy subjects. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the mediating roles of salivary amylase and particle size on blood glucose levels are&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a randomized cross-over design. Each subject consumes two different&#xD;
      test-lunches (chick peas and brown rice) in duplicate at either long or short duration. Their&#xD;
      breakfast will be standardized during these 8 test days. For a duration of 12 days, blood&#xD;
      glucose levels will be monitored via a continuous glucose device. Furthermore expectorated&#xD;
      boluses will be collected for assessment of amylase activity and food particle size.&#xD;
