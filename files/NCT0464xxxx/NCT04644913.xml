  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery and radiation therapy play a major role in the treatment of bone and soft tissue&#xD;
      tumors. Osteosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and Ewing tumors are the most common histologic&#xD;
      types. Surgery may require multiple techniques and radiation therapy may be conformational,&#xD;
      or more recently IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy). If surgery is possible, lower&#xD;
      limb surgery is generally the recommended treatment, even if a poor functional result can be&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature is very poor regarding the impact of radiotherapy on quality of life and&#xD;
      functional results, mainly with the use of prosthetic materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tools such as the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) are now available for&#xD;
      self-assessment of functional outcomes. The presence of large cohorts such as FCCSS, COHOPER&#xD;
      and SALTO facilitates these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SF-36 is a short 36-question health questionnaire that consists of a generic, consistent,&#xD;
      and easy-to-administer set of measures. These measures are based on self-report by patients&#xD;
      and are now widely used by organizations managing the care of adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TESS Functional Questionnaire is a patient-completed self-questionnaire widely used for&#xD;
      motor stimulation in patients with musculoskeletal tumors. This score is based on the&#xD;
      definitions of handicap, impairment and handicap as documented by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO). It includes 30 questions assessing overall function and daily activities.&#xD;
      The final score varies from 0% to 100%, 100% being the best possible score. So far, several&#xD;
      studies have reported the validation of TESS in Portuguese, Danish, Korean, Japanese and&#xD;
      since this year in French. Indeed, the TESS questionnaire was validated in French by the&#xD;
      study &quot;Transcultural validation of TESS and MSTS questionnaires&quot; promoted by the Nantes&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;

        The PAIR Pediatrics 2017 START project is interested in adults treated for a tumor or&#xD;
        malignant hemopathy before the age of 18, in France, since 1980, and with a minimum&#xD;
        follow-up of 5 years without cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The START-os study sample will select patients with at least 5 years of follow-up after&#xD;
        childhood sarcoma treated by surgery with or without radiotherapy from the French Childhood&#xD;
        Cancer Registry (FCCSS cohorts (patients treated before 2000), COHOPER (patients treated&#xD;
        since 2000) and SALTO (patients diagnosed between 1987 and 1992)).&#xD;
