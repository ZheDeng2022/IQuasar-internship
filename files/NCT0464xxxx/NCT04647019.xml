  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the acute and chronic effects of a dietary intervention of 22&#xD;
      g freeze-dried whole wild blueberry powder. The outcomes include measures of depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, and anhedonia; cognitive tests; and biological markers of inflammation and&#xD;
      neurotransmitter turnover.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study assessing the effects&#xD;
      of an 8-week intervention of wild blueberry powder in young adults with mild to moderate&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. A total of 66 participants will be randomly assigned to either 22 g&#xD;
      blueberry powder or a matched placebo powder consumed daily with water. The severity of&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and anhedonia will be measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. In&#xD;
      addition, we will assess changes in cognitive-emotional function, transient mood, and&#xD;
      biomarkers of inflammation and neurotransmitter metabolism after 8 weeks as well as acutely&#xD;
      (2 hours after consuming a single dose).&#xD;

    <description>A validated self-rated measure of affective state, encompassing two general dimensions (positive and negative affect) and 11 distinct emotion subscales. The subscales Hostility, Shyness and Surprise will be omitted.

The scales will range from 0 to 84 points for positive affect and from 0 to 76 points for negative affect. Exploratory analyses will be carried out to examine the effect of the intervention on the following distinct affective states: Fear, Guilt, Sadness, Joviality (Happiness), Self-Assurance, Attentiveness, Fatigue, and Serenity.</description>
