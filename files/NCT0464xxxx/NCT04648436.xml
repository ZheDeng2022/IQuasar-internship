  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The rapidly increasing number of elderly (≥ 65 years old) with traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (TBI) is accompanied by substantial medical and economic consequences. An intracranial&#xD;
      hematoma, specifically an acute subdural hematoma (ASDH), is the most common injury in&#xD;
      elderly with TBI. The surgical versus conservative treatment of this patient group remains an&#xD;
      important clinical and moral dilemma, since it is in most cases unclear which treatment leads&#xD;
      to a better outcome for the patient. Current guidelines are not based on high-quality&#xD;
      evidence and compliance is low, allowing for large treatment variation in both Belgium and&#xD;
      the Netherlands for patients with a traumatic ASDH. In addition, elderly are underrepresented&#xD;
      in scientific TBI literature and are therefore not included in current guidelines or&#xD;
      prognostic models, leading to major uncertainty in (neurosurgical) decision-making for this&#xD;
      group. As participants in two large TBI research projects (CENTER-TBI, Net-QuRe), the&#xD;
      investigators observe that the uncertainty regarding treatment of elderly with a traumatic&#xD;
      ASDH will not be solved by the current ongoing studies. Therefore, they recognize the&#xD;
      necessity of undertaking a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial on the&#xD;
      (cost-)effectiveness of early surgical hematoma evacuation versus a conservative treatment in&#xD;
      elderly with a traumatic ASDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the (cost-)effectiveness of early surgical hematoma evacuation versus a&#xD;
      conservative treatment in elderly patients with a traumatic ASDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A prospective, pragmatic, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients ≥ 65 years with at first presentation a GCS ≥ 9 and a traumatic&#xD;
      ASDH &gt;10 mm or a traumatic ASDH &lt;10 mm and a midline shift &gt;5 mm, or a GCS &lt; 9 with a&#xD;
      traumatic ASDH &lt;10 mm and a midline shift &lt;5 mm without extracranial explanations for the&#xD;
      comatose state, for whom clinical equipoise exists regarding the preferred treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients are randomized to either early surgical hematoma evacuation (A) or&#xD;
      conservative management on the ICU or the ward (B). In case of neurological deterioration&#xD;
      during conservative management, delayed surgery can be performed. The exact neurosurgical&#xD;
      technique will be left to the discretion of the surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Functional outcome after 1 year, expressed by the rating on&#xD;
      the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) Nature and extent of the burden and risks&#xD;
      associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Both treatment strategies are&#xD;
      already used in current clinical practice as standard medical care. Therefore, there are no&#xD;
      extra risks for patients participating in the study compared to patients outside the study.&#xD;
      Study participation adds a minimal burden of three follow-up evaluations by visit in the&#xD;
      first year (at 3, 6 and 12 months) and subsequent yearly evaluations by phone or postal until&#xD;
      five years after the injury. Future elderly patients with a traumatic ASDH will benefit&#xD;
      mostly from this study's results.&#xD;
