  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After more than a decade of treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors (TKI), the discontinuation of treatment represents the expected new revolution.&#xD;
      The investigators has recently discovered a new innate CD8+ T population in healthy subjects,&#xD;
      the Eomes+ KIR+ CD8+ T population, with anti-tumor properties. Remarkably, these cells are&#xD;
      numerically and functionally deficient in patients at diagnosis and then restored in patients&#xD;
      in major molecular remission (MMR) on TKI. Our work performed in a retrospective pilot study&#xD;
      interestingly shows a very significant increase in the proportion of CD8+ Eomes+ KIR+ T cells&#xD;
      within total T cells in patients with prolonged success in stopping their ITK (â‰¥ 2&#xD;
      years).Thus, the investigators postulate that CD8+ Eomes+ KIR+ T cells are a predictive&#xD;
      signature of TKI arrest success in CML. The investigators will rely on a prospective&#xD;
      translational study of this cell contingent during treatment cessation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To perform this research, the investigators have started a prospective translational study to&#xD;
      collect samples in CML patients with successful versus patients who have failed TKI therapy&#xD;
      discontinuation. The investigators plan to study functional and phenotypic characteristics of&#xD;
      innate T cells. The investigators also plan to evaluate in vitro whether immune check points&#xD;
      inhibitors could help to restore the innate T lymphocytes population.&#xD;
