  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this intervention study is to compare the effect of topical Rebamipide (regular&#xD;
      and nanoparticulated) to topical Clobetasol propionate in management of Methotrexate induced&#xD;
      oral mucositis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A random sample of patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis attending at the Rheumatology&#xD;
      clinic in faculty of Medicine, Cairo University Hospital, will be enrolled by the&#xD;
      investigator in the study in a consecutive order after being examined for methotrexate&#xD;
      induced oral ulceration by means of history and clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since oral mucositis associated with Methotrexate include production of free radicals,&#xD;
      increase of inflammatory cytokines, and alteration of intracellular signal transduction, this&#xD;
      suggests that Rebamipide should be useful for its treatment and prevention. Thus, this RCT&#xD;
      will be the first to evaluate the treatment of Methotrexate-induced oral mucositis using&#xD;
      Rebamipide and Rebamipide nanoparticles in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
