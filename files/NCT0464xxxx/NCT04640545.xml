    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center ,open-label, single-arm,dose-escalation,and extended phase I of&#xD;
      LBL-007 in combination with Toripalimab. The study is designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of LBL-007 in combination with Toripalimab in the treatment of&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma(including Cutaneous melanoma, Acral melanoma, Mucosal&#xD;
      melanoma, and melanoma of unknown primary）。&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided into the following 2 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The dose escalation phase of LBL-007 combined with Toripalimab:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The dose escalation follows the&quot;rolling six design&quot; method. These subjects will be&#xD;
           treated with LBL-007 and Toripalimab. LBL-007 will be administered intravenously every&#xD;
           two weeks (Q2W) at doses of Dose A, Dose B, Dose C，Dose D .Toripalimab will be&#xD;
           administered by IV (Q2W) by the fixed dose of 3mg/kg . Subjects will be treated with&#xD;
           LBL-007 and Toripalimab for 28 days as the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation&#xD;
           period . After all subjects in each dose group have completed the DLT evaluation, a&#xD;
           safety monitoring committee (SMC) meeting will be held, and the SMC will determine&#xD;
           whether it can continue to escalate the next dose group or reduce to lower dose group or&#xD;
           add more subjects in the current dose group etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Expansion phase of LBL-007 combined with Toripalimab:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the expansion phase of co-administration, preliminary efficacy exploration is planned at&#xD;
      1-2 dose levels based on the safety results of the phase Ia study. Select patients with&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma (Cutaneous melanoma, Acral melanoma, Mucosal melanoma,&#xD;
      and melanoma of unknown primary ) to expand the study, including 2 cohorts: cohort 1 is the&#xD;
      first-line treatment of melanoma patients; cohort 2 is patients with melanoma who have&#xD;
      progressed or relapsed after receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. LBL-007 will expand the&#xD;
      study starting from Dose C or the recommended dose, and each dose level is planned to include&#xD;
      20-30 subjects. For each dose expansion, approximately 1/3 of the subjects are considering&#xD;
      first-line treatment for patients with melanoma. Researchers and sponsors can make necessary&#xD;
      adjustments to the allocation of subjects based on specific circumstances.&#xD;
