  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading cause s of health loss globally,&#xD;
      representing a large proportion of general disability. Anxiety and depression occur in 20-30&#xD;
      percent of patients following MI and have been identified as risk factors for recurrent&#xD;
      adverse cardiac event. The purpose of our this study is to develop and evaluate a disease&#xD;
      specific cognitive behavioral therapy (C BT) protocol to reduce cardia anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      increase physical inactivity and quality of life (Q oL) in patients following MI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 20 patients. The MI-specific CBT lasts for 8 weeks and is delivered&#xD;
      face-to-face via a secure digital video solution (to minimize cancelled sessions because of&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic) or at the Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset cardiac research unit, by&#xD;
      licensed psychologists with expertise in CBT for cardiac disease. During treatment, the&#xD;
      psychologists will have direct access to a cardiologist assigned to the project and&#xD;
      treatments are conducted in close interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure patient safety.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment will be based on the AF treatment developed by the research group and further be developed and adapted during the course the study, based on the clinical presentation of the MI patients and their response to the CBT interventions detailed below. The MI-specific CBT will consist of 8 weekly face-to face digital video sessions with home assignments that can be reviewed and reported in the research groups secure platform. CBT for MI primarily targets two processes of disability; cardiac anxiety, and depressive inactivity</description>
