      SANTANA Study is a phase 1, prospective, monocentric, open-label clinical trial involving&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers, with the objective to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      compressor nebulization of autologous non-hematopoietic peripheral blood stem cells (NHPBSC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted in Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center (ADSCC), and the cell processing and&#xD;
      investigational product formulation were performed at the same center according to Good&#xD;
      Laboratory Practices (GLPs) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). Participants received&#xD;
      the investigational therapy through compressor (jet) nebulization (two doses divided on Days&#xD;
      0 and 1). The primary endpoint was the safety assessment, to be measured as Adverse Reactions&#xD;
      (ARs) incidence [by the World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC)&#xD;
      causality assessment system], and the nebulization tolerability rate (Days 0 and 1). The&#xD;
      Laboratory testing profile was evaluated before treatment (Day 0 or -1) and on Days 14 and&#xD;
      28. Two thorax radiography tests (chest X-rays - CXR) were assessed: before the therapy (Day&#xD;
      0 or -1) and on Day 7. An electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment was performed on Days 0 (or -1),&#xD;
      14, and 28. The application of the validated St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) on&#xD;
      Days 0 and 28 was a surrogate safety endpoint. The whole clinical assessment in SANTANA Study&#xD;
      was daily recorded until Day 28, taking into account the ARs incidence. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoint was the tolerability assessment, measured by nebulization tolerability rate (Days 0&#xD;
      and 1), and Adverse Events (AEs) tolerability within 28-days. The trial was approved by the&#xD;
      ADSCC Research Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all&#xD;
      participants. SANTANA Study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki principles&#xD;
      and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), and the authors are responsible for designing the trial,&#xD;
      compiling, and analyzing the data.&#xD;
