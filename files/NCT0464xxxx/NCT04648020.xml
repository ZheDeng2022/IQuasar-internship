  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new drug, clonidine HCl MBT,&#xD;
      to prevent the onset of severe oral mucositis (SOM) in patients with oropharyngeal cancer&#xD;
      (OPC) who are being treated with chemoradiotherapy. OPC occurs on the back of the tongue or&#xD;
      throat and is often treated by the use of chemoradiotherapy, where radiation is localized to&#xD;
      these areas. Radiation to the OPC affected tissues causes the release of small proteins&#xD;
      called cytokines that cause damage to the area surrounding the tumor including the oral&#xD;
      cavity. This damage is characterized by the formation of mucositis which includes redness,&#xD;
      pain and ulcers in the mouth and back of the throat. In addition, as more chemoradiation is&#xD;
      administered to treat OPC, the inability to eat a solid diet (a Grade 3 mucositis) or to&#xD;
      consume anything at all by mouth (a Grade 4 mucositis) occurs in many patients. Collectively,&#xD;
      Grade 3 and Grade 4 mucositis is referred to as SOM. It is a frequent, debilitating side&#xD;
      effect of chemoradiation in OPC that may cause patients to stop or interrupt their treatment,&#xD;
      develop other side effects like the inability to swallow, or require the increased use of&#xD;
      pain medications. OPC survivors who have successful treatment of their tumors often develop&#xD;
      permanent swallowing, speaking and range of motion issues that may be linked back to the&#xD;
      inability to eat and/or drink caused by SOM during their chemoradiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
      Clonidine may inhibit the production of cytokines that cause SOM and clonidine HCl&#xD;
      mucoadhesive buccal tablet (MBT) has been designed to deliver sustained high levels of&#xD;
      clonidine in the oral cavity, potentially decreasing cytokine production and leading to a&#xD;
      decrease in the incidence of SOM. Clonidine HCl MBT is a once per day treatment provided as a&#xD;
      tablet that a patient may self-administer to the gums, where it sticks tightly to release&#xD;
      clonidine over many hours. The primary objective of this Phase 2b/3 study is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether clonidine HCl MBT is more effective than placebo MBT in decreasing the incidence of&#xD;
      SOM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a sequential design Phase 2b/3 multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study to compare the efficacy and safety of clonidine HCl&#xD;
      MBT to placebo MBT in the prevention of severe oral mucositis (SOM) in patients with&#xD;
      oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Best supportive care (BSC)&#xD;
      will be allowed as per individual institutional practice with some exceptions as described in&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      clonidine MBT or placebo. Patients will be centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The&#xD;
      randomization will be stratified by p16 status (positive or negative). Randomized patients&#xD;
      will be required to self-apply the study drug to the gum once a day in addition to BSC. The&#xD;
      first application of MBT study drug will be performed on Day 1 of the CRT regimen. Each site&#xD;
      will require the patient to follow the same local practice for BSC per Multinational&#xD;
      Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO)&#xD;
      guidelines with some exceptions as described in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Daily,&#xD;
      self-administered MBT study drug will be continued once daily for the entire duration of CRT&#xD;
      treatment; defined as from Day 1 of CRT until the last day of CRT (anticipated to be&#xD;
      approximately 4-8 weeks depending on the patient's prescribed CRT plan). Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited sequentially into either the Phase 2b or the Phase 3 part of the study. An interim&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted when Phase 2b patients have either completed their CRT or&#xD;
      discontinued from the study. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the Phase 2b&#xD;
      efficacy and safety data at the interim analysis and will make a recommendation on proceeding&#xD;
      with the Phase 3 part of the study.&#xD;
