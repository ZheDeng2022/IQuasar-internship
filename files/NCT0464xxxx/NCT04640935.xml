      The aim of the study is to evaluate the paclitaxel-bevacizumab combination retrospectively&#xD;
      and multicenter in current practice, with subgroup analyses of the following patients:&#xD;
      patients who have previously received immunotherapy, patients with an EGFR or ALK oncogenic&#xD;
      addiction pathway, patients who have previously received taxanes or anti-angiogenic agents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung and bronchopulmonary cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in France and&#xD;
      worldwide. It is diagnosed at the metastatic stage from the outset in approximately 50% of&#xD;
      cases. Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are the most frequent histological forms of lung&#xD;
      cancer (approximately 85% of cases) with a predominance of the non-epidermal type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in the number of treatments available, improved supportive care and better&#xD;
      patient selection have, in recent years, made it possible to expand the range of first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatments available at delà̀ and have contributed to the increase in overall&#xD;
      survival (OS). As a result, nearly 80% of patients with metastatic NSCLC receive a second&#xD;
      line of treatment. The main objective in these often symptomatic patients is a satisfactory&#xD;
      tumor control rate with acceptable tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a long time, the second-line reference chemotherapy has been docetaxel or pemetrexed as&#xD;
      monotherapy with modest results. Alternative treatments such as the combination of paclitaxel&#xD;
      (chemotherapy)-bevacizumab (anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody) have been studied. Since&#xD;
      2010, by analogy with breast cancer and in the absence of therapeutic alternatives, the&#xD;
      paclitaxel-bevacizumab doublet has been used in non-epidermal stage IV NSCLC in France. The&#xD;
      value of combining taxane chemotherapy with an anti-angiogenic molecule has been demonstrated&#xD;
      in two Phase 3 clinical trials. Thus, this combination is an integral part of the possible&#xD;
      treatments in 2nd line and beyond, registered since 2016 in the treatment guidelines for&#xD;
      non-epidermal NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first-line therapeutic strategy will also be redefined in 2019 with the use of&#xD;
      immunotherapy for a majority of patients. Subsequent treatment lines will be modified, with a&#xD;
      focus on chemotherapy, in particular the paclitaxel-bevacizumab combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this combination has been used in current practice for several years, and in view of the&#xD;
      upcoming changes to the first and second line of NSCLC treatment, data on the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerance of this combination in real life are needed to guide our practices. Recent studies&#xD;
      are also looking at the efficacy of chemotherapy, particularly taxane chemotherapy associated&#xD;
      with an anti-angiogenic agent after a previous line including immunotherapy, with a favorable&#xD;
      signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the paclitaxel-bevacizumab combination retrospectively&#xD;
      and multicenter in current practice, with subgroup analyses of the following patients:&#xD;
      patients who have previously received immunotherapy, patients with an EGFR or ALK oncogenic&#xD;
      addiction pathway, patients who have previously received taxanes or anti-angiogenic agents.&#xD;
