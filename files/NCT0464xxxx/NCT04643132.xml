      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore effects of S-ketamine on postoperative pain and cognitive dysfunction after tibial&#xD;
      fracture and orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate and examine the incidence of adverse effects with the purpose of selecting the&#xD;
      optimum dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increase in human life span, orthopedic injuries and subsequent repair surgery have&#xD;
      become a major health problem which impairs the life quality of patients and burdens&#xD;
      healthcare systems worldwide. Poor post-surgical pain control is a leading factor that&#xD;
      hinders the physical rehabilitation and musculoskeletal functional recovery, and causes acute&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and chronic pain syndrome. Also, existing treatments of opioids and&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have potential drawbacks, which may in turn interfere&#xD;
      with bone healing. Therefore, prophylaxis of fracture-associated pain is indispensable to&#xD;
      postoperative comfort and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no denying the fact that pathologic pain is related to central glutaminergic system&#xD;
      and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation induced central sensitization. Also, we&#xD;
      previously reported that neuroinflammation is associated with pain development and cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction. Ketamine, a NMDA receptor antagonist, is effective in reversing NMDA receptor&#xD;
      activation underlying pain states. But the side effects of ketamine limit its clinical&#xD;
      application, such as Delirium, gibberish and agitation. It is clarified that S-ketamine has&#xD;
      lower side effects than ketamine and that antinociception of S-ketamine is stronger than&#xD;
      ketamine. The following study is carried out to evaluate whether S-ketamine can prevent&#xD;
      postoperative pain and cognitive impairment after tibial fracture and orthopedic surgery in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
