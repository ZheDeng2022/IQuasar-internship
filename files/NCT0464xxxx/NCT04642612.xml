    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) following regional&#xD;
      anesthesia for shoulder surgery. The results of this study will help to further understand&#xD;
      the physiologic effect of the interscalene nerve block on cerebral blood flow.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, cerebral blood flow (CBF) is believed to decline when mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP) is below the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation. Cerebral blood flow autoregulation&#xD;
      refers to the capacity of the central nervous system to maintain blood flow within a wide&#xD;
      range of mean arterial blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The habitual thinking is that the brain is perfused merely dependent by the blood pressure&#xD;
      and that above or below the limits of cerebral autoregularion CBF is pressure passive.&#xD;
      Despite this notion, there is evidence showing that parameters other than MAP influence&#xD;
      cerebral hemodynamics independent of cerebral autoregulation. One of the physiologic&#xD;
      processes that contribute to CBF regulation is cardiac output (CO). However, exactly how an&#xD;
      alteration in CO, in the face of a stable blood pressure, leads to a change in CBF is not&#xD;
      entirely clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the suggested mechanisms in play is the sympathetic nervous system (SNS)-mediated&#xD;
      vasoconstriction of extracranial and proximal intracranial vessels. Cerebral arteries are&#xD;
      abundantly innervated by sympathetic nerve fibers originating from the superior cervical&#xD;
      ganglion. Studies have shown that CBF reduction is attenuated by pharmacologic blockade or&#xD;
      extirpation of the cervical sympathetic chain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthetic protocol for patients undergoing major shoulder surgery include an&#xD;
      interscalene nerve block (ISNB) combined with general anesthesia in the sitting position. The&#xD;
      ISNB involves injecting local anesthetic at the level of the cervical spinal roots. One of&#xD;
      the most common side effects encountered after ISNB is Horner syndrome, which is&#xD;
      characterized by ptosis, myosis, and enopthalmia. Horner's syndrome results from the&#xD;
      diffusion of the local anesthetic solution to the ipsilateral sympathetic cervical chain&#xD;
      (stellate ganglion). The presence of Horner's syndrome indicates spread of local anesthetic&#xD;
      to the sympathetic chain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether this degree of sympatholytic following interscalene block is associated with an&#xD;
      observable change in CBF is unknown. Studies in baboon have shown that cervical surgical&#xD;
      sympathectomy maintained CBF in the face of hemorrhagic hypotension and CBF did not decrease&#xD;
      until MAP was 35% of the baseline value. These results suggest that sympathectomy induced by&#xD;
      the block of the sympathetic chain by the local anesthetic injected for the ISNB might alter&#xD;
      CBF. Therefore, the aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of unilateral interscalene&#xD;
      nerve block on CBF by measuring CBF velocity non-invasively with Transcranial doppler (TCD).&#xD;

    <description>The TCD automatically measures blood flow velocity in the main cerebral arteries of the circle of Willis.
