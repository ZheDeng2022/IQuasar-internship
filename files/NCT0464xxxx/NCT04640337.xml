      The main aim of this study is to verify the influence of placebo on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Intratissue Percutaneous Electrolysis (IPE) in patients suffering from with chronic patellar&#xD;
      tendinopathy (PT).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of placebo on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Intratissue Percutaneous Electrolysis (IPE) in patients with chronic PT. For this purpose a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial will be carried out, with a sample of patients diagnosed of chronic&#xD;
      PT based on signs, symptoms and clinical examination. Subjects will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      four different groups: group E1, IPE will be applied, participants will believe they are&#xD;
      receiving IPE; group E2, IPE will be applied, participants will believe they are receiving&#xD;
      placebo; group P1, IPE will not be applied, participants will believe they are receiving IPE;&#xD;
      and group P2, IPE will not be applied, participants will believe they are receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPE treatment will consist of a total of 3 sessions, with a time interval of one week between&#xD;
      the 1st and 2nd sessions and 2 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of intervention, the subjects will be assessed at baseline (V0), one&#xD;
      week after the end of the intervention (V1) and 3 weeks after the intervention (V2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In V0, sociodemographic (sex, age, profession, height, body mass index (BMI), sport activity,&#xD;
      hours of sport per week) and clinical data (associated pathologies, affected lower limb,&#xD;
      dominant lower limb, duration of symptoms) will be registered. In each assessment time&#xD;
      information regarding BMI, sports activity, hours of sport per week and location of pain will&#xD;
      be obtained. Moreover, in all assessments participants were evaluated for four physical&#xD;
      performance tests, pain and functional scales, ultrasound examination, pressure pain&#xD;
      thresholds, conditioned pain modulation, and expectations questionnaires.&#xD;
