      Phase 1 - MOST Preparation Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a pilot trial at two opioid use disorder clinic sites, enrolling n=10 at both&#xD;
           sites, for a total n=20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish clinical trial procedures and document feasibility at both sites prior to&#xD;
           conducting a fully powered optimization trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Demonstrate our ability to a) recruit participants; b) train yoga teachers to fidelity;&#xD;
           c) randomize participants to intervention components and correctly administer&#xD;
           components; d) run classes; and e) collect follow-up assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase 1, we will enroll 10 participants at each recruitment site (n=20). The purpose of&#xD;
      Phase 1 (MOST Preparation Phase) is to allow us to establish and refine procedures at these&#xD;
      new sites and document aspects of feasibility, including our ability to a) recruit&#xD;
      participants; b) train yoga teachers to fidelity; c) randomize participants to intervention&#xD;
      components and correctly administer these components; d) run classes; and e) collect&#xD;
      follow-up assessments. Enrollment period for this phase will last approximately 4 months.&#xD;
