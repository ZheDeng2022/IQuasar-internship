    <textblock>
      POLYPATCH® study is RWE multicentre study which examine short and long-term outcomes of using&#xD;
      POLYPATCH® when exposed to a larger and more varied population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be retrieved from medical charts for each patient from time of surgery&#xD;
      (considered as baseline of study) until a maximum of 3 years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 250 up to a maximum of 300 subjects will be evaluated from 3 to 8 different&#xD;
      sites. At least 100 subjects will be evaluated in carotid location and at least 100 in&#xD;
      femoral location.&#xD;

    <description>Death is the most dramatic complication one can encounter after vascular procedure. It can result from ipsilateral stroke caused by restenosis or thrombi, patch rupture caused by patch infection, or secondary cardiovascular or neurologic risks caused by the surgery itself</description>

    <description>Subjects who did receive POLYPATCH® at least one year ago for vascular angioplasty. 2 main sub-populations will be studied depending on location of surgery (carotid and femoral) but data will be collected for all subjects who did receive POLYPATCH.</description>

    <description>Endarterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the atheromatous plaque material, or blockage, in the lining of an artery constricted by the buildup of deposits. It is carried out by separating the plaque from the arterial wall.</description>
