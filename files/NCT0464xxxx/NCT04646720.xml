    <textblock>
      New technologies have improved the aproach of patients with different pathologies. Neck pain&#xD;
      is a prevalent pathology in physical therapy clinics. Evaluating patients with an&#xD;
      electronical device could decrease the services saturation and the proffesionals overload.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in range of movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in range of movement were measured with goniometry and expressed in degrees.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in trigger points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in trigger points were measured following the Travels and Simons protocol in the trapezius, suboccipitalis, scalenes and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The number od trigger points found was registered.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in neck endurance (anterior)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in neck endurance were measured using an endurance test for the anterior neck muscles. The time performing the test was registered.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in neck endurance (posterior)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in neck endurance were measured using an endurance test for the posterior neck muscles. The time performing the test was registered.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in quality of life were measured using the Euroqol 5dimensions which comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. It also includes a visual analogue scale to report the health status from 0 to 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in quality of life were measured using the Euroqol 5dimensions which comprises a visual analogue scale to report the health status from 0 to 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in kinesiophobia were measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) which is one of the most frequently employed measures for assessing pain-related fear in pain patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in functionality were measured using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, WHODAS-2, which provides a global measure of disability and 7 domain-specific scores.</description>
