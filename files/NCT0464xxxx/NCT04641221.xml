      Phase 2 - Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) Optimization Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a factorial experiment that will allow us to evaluate the impact of each of&#xD;
           the 4 intervention components on yoga dosage received. We will enroll a total n=192. All&#xD;
           participants will receive the core yoga intervention, with random assignment to the four&#xD;
           intervention components outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use results from Phase 2 to choose an efficient combination of intervention components&#xD;
           that, together with standard yoga classes, maximizes yoga dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine mechanisms by which components are hypothesized to work.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      In Phase 2, we will conduct a fully powered optimization trial. We will enroll 192&#xD;
      participants, planning to role approximately equal numbers of participants in both sites. In&#xD;
      both phases, all participants will receive the core yoga intervention (12 weeks of weekly&#xD;
      manualized yoga classes), with random assignment to the 4 key intervention components.&#xD;
      Participants will be patients enrolled in methadone (MMT) or buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP)&#xD;
      treatment with chronic pain. Enrollment period for this phase will last approximately 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
