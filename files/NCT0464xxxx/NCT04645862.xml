  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves annual 4D CTA imaging of the bicuspid aortic valve for a period of 5&#xD;
      years. CTA is often standard of care for BAV patients, but patients in this study will&#xD;
      receive a higher radiation dose with a 4D imaging protocol. There may also be patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study who have a 4D CTA for research purposes when a routine CTA is not&#xD;
      required for clinical care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to better understand the anatomy of physiologically normal, or competent, BAVs&#xD;
      without stenosis or insufficiency (AI) in order to support evidence-based standardization of&#xD;
      BAV repair surgery. Men and women over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of BAV and minimal&#xD;
      aortic valve calcification at baseline will undergo annual 4D computed tomography angiography&#xD;
      (CTA) scans, routine transthoracic echocardiograms, and history and physical assessments over&#xD;
      the course of the 5-year study period. Patients who are pregnant, have renal insufficiency&#xD;
      (creatinine 2 mg/dL), or who have a contraindication to intravenous contrast will be&#xD;
      excluded. Patients will be stratified into study groups according to baseline AI:&#xD;
      approximately half of patients will have no to mild AI at baseline and the other half will&#xD;
      have moderate to severe AI at baseline. Anatomical measurements will be obtained from the 4D&#xD;
      CTA scans and analyzed at each phase of the cardiac cycle, as well as longitudinally. The 4D&#xD;
      CTA imaging and analysis will not impact medical care of the study participants; the&#xD;
      anatomical measurements will be used in the future as evidence-based standards for&#xD;
      determining valve repair candidacy for BAV patients with AI.&#xD;
