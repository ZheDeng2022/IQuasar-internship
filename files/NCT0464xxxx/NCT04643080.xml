  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of dairy-based probiotics on cognitive&#xD;
      function, emotional wellbeing, and inflammation. Subjects were assigned to either consume 6&#xD;
      oz of yogurt/day or abstain from consuming yogurt and other probiotic-containing foods for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Subjects completed baseline testing and 12-week follow-up testing consisting of a&#xD;
      laboratory blood draw to assess inflammatory biomarkers, and a computerized assessment to&#xD;
      evaluate cognitive and emotional wellbeing measures.&#xD;
