  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of a&#xD;
      single oral dose of fezolinetant under fasted and fed conditions in healthy female&#xD;
      participants. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose&#xD;
      of fezolinetant under fasted and fed conditions in healthy female participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participant will participate in 2 treatment periods separated by a washout of at least 5&#xD;
      days between investigational product (IP) administration in each period. Participants will be&#xD;
      admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 of period 1 and will be in clinical unit for periods&#xD;
      1 and 2. On day 1 of each period, participants will receive fezolinetant followed by a&#xD;
      72-hour blood sampling period. The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV)&#xD;
      which will take place 5 to 9 days after the 72-hour blood sampling period in period 2 or at&#xD;
      the time of early discontinuation from the study.&#xD;

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP. This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the (study) procedures.</description>
