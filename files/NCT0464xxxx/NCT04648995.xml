      Purpose of the study is to assess the effect and evaluate topographic volume changes of&#xD;
      UltraPulse at treating boxcar scars with different energy and the effect of UltraPulse at&#xD;
      treating icepick scars.&#xD;

      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo a 24 hour screening period to determine eligibility for study&#xD;
      entry. Upon enrollment, patient who fulfill all the inclusion criteria and does not fulfill&#xD;
      any exclusion criteria will be scheduled for their visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be receiving two sessions of treatment, with the two sessions 8-12 weeks&#xD;
      apart. Subjects' face will be divided to left and right, with each side randomized to receive&#xD;
      a low versus high energy setting. In the low energy setting side of the face, central base of&#xD;
      boxcar scar will be treated with 20mJ, while shoulder of scar will be treated with 50 mJ. In&#xD;
      the high energy setting side of the face, central base of boxcar scar will be treated with&#xD;
      30mJ, while shoulder of scar will be treated with 60 mJ. Subject will be blinded regarding&#xD;
      which side of the face received low versus high energy setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound will be used to assess epidermal and dermal thickness change at the treated area.&#xD;
      This will be performed before the 1st and 2nd treatment session as well as one month and&#xD;
      three month after the 2nd treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antera Quantitative 3D Image Analysis will be performed before and after the 1st and 2nd&#xD;
      treatment session as well as one month and three month after the 2nd treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3mm punch biopsy will be taken from 10 volunteers over bilateral face before the 1st&#xD;
      treatment session and 3 month after the 2nd treatment session (total of 4 sample will be&#xD;
      obtained in each volunteer). Skin specimen will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin as well&#xD;
      as relevant stain for collagen and elastic fiber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical photograph will be taken before and after the 1st and 2nd treatment session as well&#xD;
      as one month and three month after the 2nd treatment session. Two blinded board certified&#xD;
      dermatologist will be asked to rate the improvement of acne scar by GSAAS according to the&#xD;
      clinical photograph taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be asked to rate their satisfaction regarding treatment response over each&#xD;
      side of the face using a 0 to 10 point scale chart.&#xD;
