  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marfan syndrome (MFS) affects multiple organ systems including the heart, bones, ligaments,&#xD;
      and eyes, and is associated with significant risk of aortic dissection. Given limited&#xD;
      evidence from in-vitro studies, and theoretical concerns, the majority of patients with MFS&#xD;
      are restricted from certain physical activities. The lack of exercise and deconditioning have&#xD;
      detrimental effects including increasing weakness, joint pain, decreased endurance, and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. Given the significant paucity of data currently existing on the effects&#xD;
      of exercise in humans with MFS, and the recent, optimistic findings in rodent models, this&#xD;
      pilot trial was established to assess the effects of moderated dynamic exercise in&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults with MFS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Marfan syndrome (MFS) affects multiple organ systems including the heart, bones, ligaments,&#xD;
      and eyes, and is associated with significant risk of aortic dissection. Given anecdotal&#xD;
      reports of aortic dissection, limited evidence from in-vitro studies, and theoretical&#xD;
      concerns, the majority of patients with MFS are restricted from certain physical activities,&#xD;
      most commonly isometric exercise and contact sports. Published guidelines also suggest&#xD;
      restriction from highly dynamic competitive sports. While clinicians may mean to restrict&#xD;
      patients only from competitive sports, often children and families interpret this caution as&#xD;
      applying to almost all exercise, resulting in a large number of patients with Marfan syndrome&#xD;
      being sedentary. This lack of exercise and deconditioning likely have detrimental effects in&#xD;
      increasing weakness and joint pain and decreasing endurance. Depressive symptoms are also not&#xD;
      uncommon in Marfan syndrome, and may be triggered or exacerbated by guidance to acutely cease&#xD;
      participation in sports at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, as far as the investigators are aware, there are no published controlled studies on&#xD;
      the effects of dynamic exercise on human subjects. In 2017, Mas-Stachurska et al published a&#xD;
      study suggesting that a moderate level of dynamic exercise mitigated progressive degradation&#xD;
      of the cardiac structures typically seen in Marfan Syndrome in a rodent sample. This study&#xD;
      suggests the possibility that the fears surrounding moderate exercise in humans may be&#xD;
      unwarranted. In addition, this study suggests that moderate exercise may actually protect the&#xD;
      aorta and myocardium, in addition to the numerous other physical and emotional benefits that&#xD;
      have been shown to result from consistent exercise. The overall goal is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of a moderate dynamic exercise program on measures of cardiovascular, muscular, and&#xD;
      mental health in adolescents and young adults with Marfan syndrome. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      perform a randomized pilot study to calculate effect estimates to perform a larger&#xD;
      multi-center study. The objective is to 1) randomize 20 patients with Marfan syndrome age&#xD;
      12-21 years to current status (controls) versus a moderate dynamic exercise intervention,&#xD;
      then 2) allow the control group patients to undergo the exercise intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will then compare outcomes between both the intervention and control groups,&#xD;
      and between the baseline and post-intervention states. Specific outcome measures will include&#xD;
      cardiovascular assessment: maximal oxygen uptake (max VO2), segmental and central aortic&#xD;
      stiffness, ventricular mass and volume, and endothelial function, muscular/physical&#xD;
      assessment: manual muscle testing (MMT), functional balance, and pain assessment, and quality&#xD;
      of life/mental health assessment: health-related quality of life, depression and anxiety&#xD;
      screening scales. The hypothesis is that the intervention of a moderate exercise program&#xD;
      introduced by a licensed physical therapist will result in improvement in cardiovascular&#xD;
      status, muscular health, and mental health without detrimental effects on the aortic wall.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The primary investigator will not know what groups patients are assigned to, nor will the PI be providing the outcomes testing, however there is the potential that patients may require cardiovascular oversight, in which case, the PI would have to be aware of group assignment. The co-PI (physical therapist) will know which groups participants are randomized to but will not know the cardiovascular outcome measures. the participants will be partially blinded to group assignment, as all will receive the same testing measures. The cardiovascular outcomes assessor will be fully blinded.</masking_description>

    <description>Patients will be educated on methods of self-evaluating exertion and cardiovascular effort by assessing respiratory rate and perceived exertion. Next, patients will be given options for cardiovascular activities and complete at a moderate level of activity for a minimum of 150 minutes per week. Patients will perform a combination of exercises under the supervision of a physical therapist until a mod intensity level is reached and sustained. Patients will be taught to use the activity tracker to record their heart rate, activity, and PES. Patients will have a phone call every 2 weeks to assess status, answer questions, and provide guidance on progressing intensity or duration of exercise. At the end of 4 months all patients from both groups will return for re-assessment.</description>
