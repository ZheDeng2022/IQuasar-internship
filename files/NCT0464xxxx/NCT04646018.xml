  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects of a non-thrust manipulation&#xD;
      procedure on muscle function, spinal mobility, and pain level on those experiencing low back&#xD;
      pain (LBP) in a sample of individuals who identify English as their primary language. The&#xD;
      rationale for this language criterion is provided in Section 9:F of this application. Muscle&#xD;
      function will be measured via the muscle thickness of a deep spinal stabilizing muscle&#xD;
      (multifidus, MF) while in both a resting state and during a maximum voluntary contraction&#xD;
      (MVC). Spinal mobility will be measured as the active range of motion of both forward and&#xD;
      backward trunk bending. Pain level will be a self-report measure recorded during rest and&#xD;
      active range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: A non-thrust manipulation procedure will increase the thickness of the sacral&#xD;
      multifidus both at rest and during a maximum voluntary contraction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: A non-thrust manipulation procedure will result in greater low back active&#xD;
      range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: A non-thrust manipulation procedure will result in a reduction in the&#xD;
      participant's self-reported pain levels both at rest and during active range of motion&#xD;
      movements.&#xD;

      The proposed study aims to determine if the impact of a newly-described manual procedure,&#xD;
      that includes a non-thrust force applied to the low back region, has an impact on patient&#xD;
      centered-outcomes. Rehabilitation Ultrasound Imaging (RUSI) will be used to determine MF&#xD;
      muscle thickness (MT) at rest and during a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) immediately&#xD;
      following application of the manual procedure.&#xD;
