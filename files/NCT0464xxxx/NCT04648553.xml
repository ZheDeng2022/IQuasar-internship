  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the availability of brief interventions to help&#xD;
      children with defiant, aggressive and disruptive behaviors by creating a brief scalable&#xD;
      intervention for parents delivered via telehealth. As phase 1 study, we are conducting a&#xD;
      2-arm pilot feasibility RCT in order the intervention, measures, and procedures to be used in&#xD;
      a larger efficacy trial. The first arm will include a 3-session behavioral therapy treatment&#xD;
      we call Task-Based Grounding and the second arm will be an enhanced treatment as usual&#xD;
      comparison group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a 3-session psychosocial intervention for parents of&#xD;
      children between 9-14 with disruptive behaviors. The intervention uses telehealth visits&#xD;
      along with written and online resources to teach them parent management skills. To evaluate&#xD;
      the acceptability of this intervention and the feasibility of our methods, the investigators&#xD;
      will recruit 20 parent-child dyads to participate in this study. This is a mixed methods&#xD;
      pilot feasibility RCT design. The investigators designed this study to test the acceptability&#xD;
      of the intervention to parents and test the feasibility of our recruitment, retention,&#xD;
      measurement, and delivery mechanisms for both the experimental and comparison conditions. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a block randomization method to separate parent-child dyads into&#xD;
      either treatment or comparison groups. The treatment condition involves 3 telehealth visits&#xD;
      and a set of parenting resources. The enhanced treatment as usual condition will involve&#xD;
      contact with a &quot;care navigator&quot; that will assess behavior problems in the child and help the&#xD;
      parents find an appropriate referral to care in their community. Both groups will be followed&#xD;
      for 10 weeks, provide outcome data, and participate in semi-structured qualitative interviews&#xD;
      to accept acceptability.&#xD;

    <description>Three 50 minutes sessions with an interventionist that includes 6 non-punitive components of treatment common in Behavioral Parent Trainings: Education on behavior change, positive one-on-one time between parents and their children, differential attending to positive and negative behaviors, effective praise, giving effective instructions, and using a point and reward system to encourage prosocial behaviors. These components are distilled into 5 skill modules and paired with Task-Based Grounding, which involves a brief restriction of privileges and provides children with the opportunity to end the restriction by completing a prosocial task.</description>

    <description>Two sessions with a facilitator. The facilitator does NOT provide any guidance to the parent on managing their child's behavior, but provides empathy and problem solving to help them find a resource that best fits their needs. It is particularly geared towards helping parents connect with Behavioral Parent Trainings to address the needs of children with oppositional, defiant, or aggressive behaviors.</description>
