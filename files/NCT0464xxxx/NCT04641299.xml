  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD8233 is a PCSK9-targeted ASO for the reduction of circulating levels of LDL-C. This study&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the dose-dependent reduction in LDL-C after SC administration of multiple&#xD;
      doses of AZD8233 as well as the associated adverse effects profile. The data generated will&#xD;
      be used to guide choice of doses, dosing regimens, and sample sizes, as well as safety and PD&#xD;
      monitoring in the further clinical development program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2b study&#xD;
      in approximately 108 participants with dyslipidemia. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of AZD8233 on LDL-C across different dose levels. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at up to 25 sites in up to 4 countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening period starts up to 42 days before the randomization visit and ends on Day -1.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will attend 7 visits during the treatment period and 7 additional&#xD;
      visits during the safety follow up period. Eligible participants are randomized across four&#xD;
      different treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for a 12-week treatment period. The planned&#xD;
      treatment arms are AZD8233 low dose, AZD8233 medium dose, AZD8233 high dose, and Placebo.&#xD;
      Participants will be dosed SC on Days 1, 8, 29, and 57.&#xD;
