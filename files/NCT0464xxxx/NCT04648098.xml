    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine the effect of post-stroke discharge training and&#xD;
      telephone counseling service on patients' functional status and caregiver burden. The study&#xD;
      was conducted with 69 stroke patients (34 in the intervention group and 35 in the control&#xD;
      group) and their caregivers. In the study, data were collected before discharge and three&#xD;
      months after discharge. Discharge training and telephone counseling (one week after discharge&#xD;
      and once a month for three months) were given to the caregivers of the patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;

      This study, which was planned as a randomised controlled study, was conducted in the&#xD;
      neurology clinic of a university hospital in Turkey. The sample size was calculated by&#xD;
      predicting 5% tolerance and 80% power ratio at a 95% confidence level, and it was determined&#xD;
      that a minimum of 72 patients and caregivers should be included in the study. A total of 80&#xD;
      participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomised to either the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, Patient Information Form, Modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index were used to&#xD;
      collect data about patients, while Caregiver Information Form and Caregiver Burden Scale were&#xD;
      used to collect data about caregivers Pre-tests were applied to patients and caregivers in&#xD;
      the intervention and control groups before discharge. After the pre-tests were applied to the&#xD;
      caregivers in the intervention group, discharge training was given.&#xD;

    <description>Caregiver Burden Scale, developed by Zarit et al. (1980), was used to evaluate the care burden of patient relatives. There are 22 expressions in the scale that determine the effect of caregiving on the individual's life. The score obtained from the five-point Likert scale is minimum 0 and maximum 88.A high score on the scale indicates that the problem experienced by the caregiver is high.</description>

    <description>The Barthel Index to developed by Mahoney and Barthel in 1965 to evaluate physical independence in daily life activities. Index consists of 10 items that include daily life activities and is used to evaluate the level of functional independence. Items in the scale are graded between 0 and 15 points in 5 increments according to the question. The score ranges from 0 to 100 (0-20 points fully dependent, 21-61 points highly dependent, 62-90 points moderately dependent, 91-99 points slightly dependent, 100 points fully independent).</description>

    <description>Modified Rankin Scale evaluating the functional limitation and degree of addiction occurring in the patient after stroke was evaluated in seven categories (0: No symptoms, 1: No obvious deficits, 2: Mild deficits, 3: Moderate deficits, 4: Severe deficits, 5: Very severe deficit and 6: Death).</description>

    <description>The discharge training was given by using different teaching methods in the form of verbal expression, demonstration, and question and answer. The care guide prepared by the researchers in line with the literature was used as a training material for stroke patients and their caregivers.The training varied according to the learning level of individuals but took an average of 40-60 minutes.&#xD;
Consultation service was given to the caregivers one week after discharge and once a month for three months by telephone call.</description>
