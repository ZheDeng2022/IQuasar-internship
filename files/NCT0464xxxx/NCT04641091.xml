    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to define an independent parameter for the diagnostic&#xD;
      assessment of the perfusion situation of the calf muscle based on Multispectral Optoacoustic&#xD;
      Tomography (MSOT) in a cross-sectional collective of healthy volunteers and patients with&#xD;
      PAD. The gold standard is a previously performed angiography of the pelvic and femoral&#xD;
      vessels based on routine diagnostics, this Imaging is not mandatory for healthy Control group&#xD;
      (study group 1). An independent validation group (study group 2) will validate the results&#xD;
      found in study group 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD) is one of the most common diseases of the elderly&#xD;
      with an overall prevalence of about 3-10%. As life expectancy increases, new treatment&#xD;
      concepts and new diagnostic procedures are needed. In addition to the possibility of&#xD;
      endovascular treatment and open surgery, in some cases there is also the possibility of a&#xD;
      conservative therapeutic approach, e.g. with medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the only independent non-invasive validation of these treatment options is the&#xD;
      measurement of macrocirculation in the form of Color-Coded Vascular Duplex Sonography (CCDS),&#xD;
      the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) or the measurement of walking distance. The S3 guideline for&#xD;
      diagnosis, therapy and medical aftercare of PAD published 2015 by the DGA (Deutsche&#xD;
      Gesellschaft für Angiologie und Gefäßmedizin [German Society for Angiology and Vascular&#xD;
      Medicine]) recommends aftercare in the sense of clinical examinations, especially for&#xD;
      patients after vascular surgery. For the validation measures already mentioned, however,&#xD;
      there are not infrequent patient groups for which these methods provide only insufficient or&#xD;
      unusable results (diabetes mellitus, terminal renal failure). In these cases, independent&#xD;
      verification of the success of the therapy performed would have to be performed using&#xD;
      angiography (digital subtraction angiography, CT angiography or MR angiography). However,&#xD;
      this is not routinely performed in the respective patient populations due to the associated&#xD;
      risks (including radiation exposure, contrast agent administration, invasiveness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) now provides a new non-invasive diagnostic tool&#xD;
      that may be able to fill this diagnostic gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this cross-sectional study is to define an independent parameter using the MSOT&#xD;
      method, which allows a statement about the current perfusion situation of the lower extremity&#xD;
      and correlates with the angiography, which is considered the gold standard. For this purpose,&#xD;
      patients of different PAD stages, who already underwent routinely angiographies in advance,&#xD;
      will be included. In addition, a control group of healthy volunteers (prior angiography not&#xD;
      obligatory) will be examined.&#xD;
