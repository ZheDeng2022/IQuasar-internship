  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate a modified targeted fortification method of&#xD;
      pasteurized donor human milk (PDHM) in very low birth weight infants (VLBWs). Pools of PDHM&#xD;
      will be analyzed for macronutrient content using the Miris Human Milk Analyzer. The control&#xD;
      arm will receive standard of care, which is PDHM without additional protein fortification.&#xD;
      The intervention arm will receive PDHM with a fat content of 3.8g/dL or more, with additional&#xD;
      protein fortification of 0.67g/dL. Primary outcome will be rate of malnutrition at hospital&#xD;
      discharge or 37 weeks, whichever earlier. Secondary outcomes include body composition, feed&#xD;
      tolerance, and morbidity outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hospital milk bank provides pasteurized donor human milk (PDHM) to very low birth weight&#xD;
      (VLBW) infants without sufficient mother's milk, with the overall aim of lowering the risk of&#xD;
      necrotizing enterocolitis in this population. However, with the introduction of PDHM in our&#xD;
      setting, rates of suboptimal weight gain have increased (60.2% to 65.7%). This is likely due&#xD;
      to the fact that PDHM is often lower in energy and protein than preterm mother's own milk.&#xD;
      One solution to delivery adequate nutrition in this VLBWs receiving PDHM, is targeted&#xD;
      fortification, which involves measurement of the macronutrient content of human milk, and&#xD;
      adding extra macronutrients to reach nutrient goals. In this proposed study, we will conduct&#xD;
      a pilot randomized controlled trial of a modified targeted fortification versus standard&#xD;
      care. This study will include preterm VLBW infants (&lt;1500g), without congenital conditions&#xD;
      resulting in growth restriction, and receiving &gt;25% of PDHM use in the first week of life. 40&#xD;
      patients in each arm will be recruited over a period of 2 years. The intervention group will&#xD;
      receive a modified targeted fortification, consisting of selection of high fat PDHM (3.8g/dL&#xD;
      or more) with the addition of protein fortification of 0.67g/dL from week 2 of life until a&#xD;
      gestational age of 37 weeks or hospital discharge, whichever earlier. The control group will&#xD;
      receive usual regular PDHM with standard fortification using human milk fortifier as per&#xD;
      current practice. The primary outcome is the rate of suboptimal growth (drop in weight&#xD;
      z-score from birth â‰¥0.8) at discharge or 37 weeks. Secondary outcomes include body&#xD;
      composition, feed tolerance, and morbidity outcomes.&#xD;
