  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective, single-arm, observational study in patients with Lupus&#xD;
      nephritis (LN) who newly (i.e.,for the first time) received treatment of Enteric-coated&#xD;
      Mycophenolate Sodium (EC-MPS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study. Patients will be treated and followed according to routine&#xD;
      medical practice in terms of visit frequency and type of assessment performed. Only endpoint&#xD;
      related data will be collected as part of the study. Patient demographic information, disease&#xD;
      characteristics, treatments and laboratory data will be collected retrospectively.&#xD;
