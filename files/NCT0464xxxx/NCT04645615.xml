    <textblock>
      A prospective, non-randomized, multi-center clinical trial. The patient population includes&#xD;
      patients with permanent or persistent AF requiring valve replacements or repairs, ASD&#xD;
      repairs, PFO closure or coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) procedures. Patients are not&#xD;
      allowed to have had previous atrial ablation, AV-nodal ablation, or surgical Maze procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Cardioblate Surgical Ablation System is cleared in Canada and Europe for ablation of&#xD;
      cardiac tissue for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. In the United States, the&#xD;
      Cardioblate bipolar is approved for soft tissue ablation, while the Cardioblate Pen is&#xD;
      approved for cardiac tissue ablation. The purpose of the clinical study is to obtain a&#xD;
      labeling claim for the US market that the Cardioblate Surgical Ablation System can be used&#xD;
      for ablation of cardiac tissue in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation among permanent and persistent AF patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Documented history of AF a For inclusion in permanent AF arm: Patients must have&#xD;
                  a documented history of permanent AF (cardioversion failure) as defined by the&#xD;
                  ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines; Documentation of AF must include one or more chart&#xD;
                  references to AF and/or one or more ECG's with AF prior to the patient's surgery.&#xD;
                  Other supporting information could include references to cardioversion attempts&#xD;

                  Patients must have a documented history of persistent AF as defined by the&#xD;
                  ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines: characterized as episodes of non-self-terminating atrial&#xD;
                  fibrillation that usually lasts more than 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;

             surgery (i.e. cardiogenic shock) or redo open heart surgery, 6 Preoperative need for&#xD;
             an intra-aortic balloon pump or intravenous inotropes, 7 Previous atrial ablation,&#xD;
             AV-nodal ablation, or surgical Maze procedure, 8 Contraindication for anticoagulation&#xD;
             therapy, 9 Current diagnosis of active systemic infection, 10 Renal failure requiring&#xD;
             dialysis or hepatic failure, 11 Documented myocardial infarction 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
             study enrollment, 12 Life expectancy of less than one year, or 13 Pregnancy or desire&#xD;
             to be pregnant within 12-months of the study treatment.&#xD;
