  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in 2017 investigator found that the&#xD;
      incidence of type 2 diabetes is currently 425 million people aged 20 to 79 in the world, and&#xD;
      this data will increase o 629 million at 2045, The etiology of more than 90% is related to&#xD;
      aging, it has become a serious challenge to public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is a newly noticed severe syndrome characterized by reduced walking speed,&#xD;
      decreased grip strength, and decreased muscle mass. Patients with type 2 diabetes are at risk&#xD;
      of sarcopenia and are those with normal blood sugar. One of the main ways to improve the face&#xD;
      of sarcopenia is to exercise intensity. By carrying out a gradual training plan instead of&#xD;
      using different weights, it will lead to muscle hypertrophy and increase in muscle strength&#xD;
      to achieve muscle gain. In view of the fact that the commercially available sandbags are&#xD;
      cheap and easy to obtain, the weight is fixed, and the use variability is high, it is&#xD;
      expected to introduce quantitative weight-bearing progressive exercises in type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and have symptoms of muscle loss to improve muscle mass, and to control blood sugar. The&#xD;
      quality of life can have better benefits.&#xD;

      Purpose:This study aim is effectiveness of 12 weeks quantitative weight-bearing progressive&#xD;
      exercise training in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) with pre-sarcopenia&#xD;
      promotion muscle strength and blood sugar control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:After 12 weeks of quantitative sandbag training , the experimental group can have&#xD;
      a significant increase in the muscle mass of the upper and lower limbs、grip strength、5-time&#xD;
      chair stand test、Lipid profile、glycemic control(HbA1c) and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:This study will be a randomized controlled trial. Forty adult diagnosis with T2DM&#xD;
      with pre-sarcopenia patient randomly assigned to experimental group and control group.&#xD;
      Experimental group wearing 0.5 kg quantitative sandbag 12~15 Repetitions/set X 5 set X 3day.&#xD;
      Weight adjustment: After the first month of intervention, if the experimental can perform for&#xD;
      more than 20 repetitions/set , we will asked to increase the weight of the sandbag to 1 kg&#xD;
      until the end of the experiment Conditions:The effectiveness of 12 weeks quantitative&#xD;
      weight-bearing can improvement of Glycemic control and limb muscle strength.&#xD;
