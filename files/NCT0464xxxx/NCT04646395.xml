  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter open label phase II trial in patients with previously treated Marginal&#xD;
      Zone Lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of tafasitamab in combination&#xD;
      with acalabrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four patients are expected to be enrolled and treated every 28 days with acalabrutinib&#xD;
      and tafasitamab for 24 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two parts, which are performed sequentially. The first part is a safety&#xD;
      run-in to evaluate the safety data once 6 patients (representing the 25% of the total cohort)&#xD;
      have completed the first cycle of treatment. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)&#xD;
      will provide an independent assessment of this evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part starts after the outcome of this evaluation and will include the remaining 18&#xD;
      patients. The 6 patients of the safety run-in phase will be considered for the final&#xD;
      evaluation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 11 - 13 weeks, patients showing partial or complete response (PR, CR) will continue&#xD;
      treatment, while patients showing stable disease (SD) will discontinue it. However, patients&#xD;
      in SD who benefit from therapy may continue to be treated, after agreement between the&#xD;
      Investigator and the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who complete the 24 cycles of treatment will enter the follow-up phase up to 3 years&#xD;
      from patient's last study treatment dose (about 5 years from treatment start).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who discontinue treatment before cycle 24 for any reason will be followed for up to&#xD;
      3 years (every 6 months for the first year and yearly for the second and third year) from the&#xD;
      patient's last study treatment dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Marginal zone B cell lymphomas (MZLs) comprise three distinct entities: extranodal MZL (EMZL)&#xD;
      of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type (MALT) lymphoma, splenic MZL (SMZL) and nodal MZL&#xD;
      (NMZL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together they represent approximately 5%-15% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MZL are in general indolent lymphomas with relatively low risk of transformation. The&#xD;
      available treatment options can lead to responses but disease recurrence is often observed.&#xD;
      For patients with MZL and recurrent disease following initial treatment, currently there is&#xD;
      no established standard therapy and new treatment options and treatment combinations are&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      tafasitamab in combination with the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib. The B-lymphocyte, lineage&#xD;
      specific surface antigen CD19 is broadly and homogeneously expressed in MZLs. This makes CD19&#xD;
      an attractive target for the treatment of MZL patients, in particular those who failed a&#xD;
      previous rituximab-containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, genetic and immunogenetic data point to B-cell receptor signalling as a&#xD;
      key oncogenic pathway of MZLs. The activity of single agent ibrutinib in MZLs is an in vivo&#xD;
      proof that MZLs are addicted of BTK-driven signalling and that the BCR pathway is a&#xD;
      vulnerability of these lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety profile of the anti CD19 monoclonal antibody tafasitamab and of the BTK inhibitor&#xD;
      acalabrutinib indicate the possibility that their combination can be developed without major&#xD;
      overlapping side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trial is a prospective multicenter trial combining tafasitamab and acalabrutinib&#xD;
      in patients with MZL (including EMZL, SMZL and NMZL) with disease refractory to or in first&#xD;
      or greater relapse after prior systemic therapy.&#xD;
