  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MS is a technology developed to non-invasively stimulate the central and peripheral nervous&#xD;
      system, is applied in the treatment of UI. The MS technique aims to directly stimulate the&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscles and sacral roots in the treatment of UI (3,4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS is a more acceptable, relatively painless, non-invasive and suitable electrical treatment&#xD;
      method for patients with UI (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from studies suggest that MS may be beneficial for patients with UI after RP&#xD;
      (1,2,5,6,7). In the literature, there are only 3 randomized controlled trials evaluating MS&#xD;
      efficacy using a magnetic chair in patients with UI after RP (1,6,8) and one of them was&#xD;
      published in Korean (6) and two of them in English(1,8). In these studies, MS was compared&#xD;
      with pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFME) or electrical stimulation (ES)&#xD;
      (intra-anal).Yokoyama et al.reported that MS and ES treatments had shown to provide earlier&#xD;
      continence compared to the control group after RP. MS and ES are recommended as options for&#xD;
      patients who want rapid recovery of postoperative UI(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liu et al reported that MS was more effective than PTKE on incontinence symptoms and quality&#xD;
      of life (8). However, as far as we know, there is no prospective randomized sham-controlled&#xD;
      study evaluating the effectiveness of MS in patients with post-RP UI. In addition, there are&#xD;
      no suggestions regarding MS in the guidelines on urinary incontinence management due to&#xD;
      insufficient data (9). In this study, sham-controlled efficacy of MS will be evaluated in&#xD;
      patients with UI after RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is the first prospective randomized controlled trial comparing MS and Sham MS&#xD;
      efficacy in patients with UI after RP. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of MS on incontinence related clinical parameters, quality of life, sexual functions,&#xD;
      depression and anxiety in patients with UI after RP.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective randomized sham-controlled study. The research will be carried&#xD;
      out between January 2021 and June 2022 in XXX Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR)&#xD;
      Department Urogynecological Rehabilitation Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the approval of XXX Faculty of Medicine Ethics Committee, 40 patients who admitted to&#xD;
      XXX PMR Polyclinic with RP complaints after UI and who accepted the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      directed to the Urogynecological Rehabilitation Unit, will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed about the content, purpose and application of the study and their&#xD;
      written consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Protocol 40 men with UI after RP who meet the exclusion and inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be divided into 2 groups using a table of random numbers. MS will be applied to the first&#xD;
      group and sham MS will be applied to the second group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Magnetic stimulation (Active MS) Group 2: Sham MS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Magnetic stimulation (Active MS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to sit in a magnetic coil chair. Magnetic flux is generated in&#xD;
      this field. This current stimulates the nerve or muscle of the pelvic floor. To administer&#xD;
      MS, a stimulation amplitude of 200 μs and a repetition of 10 Hz for 10 minutes, 2 minutes&#xD;
      rest in between, 50 Hz for 10 minutes (20 minutes total), 5 seconds on / 5 seconds off, in&#xD;
      accordance with device literature will be adjusted to produce maximum stimuli with the cycle.&#xD;
      During each treatment session, the device will be adjusted to receive patients the current&#xD;
      intensity gradually increasing, reaching the maximum stimulation intensity. MS will be&#xD;
      applied two days a week, 20 minutes a day, for 8 weeks, a total of 16 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Sham MS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sham MS treatment program will be the same as active MS in terms of duration, frequency,&#xD;
      current duration, current intensity and general patient experience. The same magnetic chair&#xD;
      will be used for both groups. Sham therapy application will be applied by the coordinator of&#xD;
      the study by placing a thin deflector lead / aluminum coated plate on the magnetic coil of&#xD;
      the magnetic chair that prevents the magnetic flux from penetrating into the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both applications, the patients will be exposed to the same sound, vibration sensation&#xD;
      and lighting of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who did not attend even one of the 16 sessions (MS and sham MS sessions) during the&#xD;
      study period will be excluded from the study. Until the study is completed, patients will not&#xD;
      be informed of what treatment they received. At the end of the treatment, patients in the&#xD;
      sham group will be allowed to receive active MS treatment.&#xD;
