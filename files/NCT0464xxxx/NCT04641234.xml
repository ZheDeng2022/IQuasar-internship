  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In people with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), the body makes too much&#xD;
      of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This causes too many blood&#xD;
      vessels to grow in a part of the eye called the macula. These blood vessels can damage the&#xD;
      macula, causing dark spots and blurriness in central vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, aflibercept, works by reducing VEGF levels in the eye.It has already been&#xD;
      approved for patients to receive as a treatment for nAMD in a fixed 8-weekly or&#xD;
      treat-and-extend dosing regimen after having received 3 monthly doses at the start of&#xD;
      treatment. In this study, the researchers want to learn more about how often patients&#xD;
      received aflibercept and how their vision changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients with nAMD who had not received treatment to reduce VEGF&#xD;
      levels in the eye before. These patients will have started treatment with aflibercept between&#xD;
      January 2016 and November 2018. The study will include about 330 men and women who are at&#xD;
      least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients had received aflibercept eye injections based on their doctor's&#xD;
      instructions. The researchers will use the patients' medical records from January 2016 to&#xD;
      November 2020 to measure the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number of aflibercept eye injections the patients received&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how long the patients could wait between treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the change in the patients' vision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how many patients stopped treatment and why.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  associations between patient and disease characteristics at the start of treatment with&#xD;
           the number of aflibercept injections and patient's vision during treatment.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014.
