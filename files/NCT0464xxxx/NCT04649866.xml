  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich's ataxia is a debilitating, inherited disease cause by mutations in a protein&#xD;
      called frataxin (FXN). FXN is one of several proteins that controls the production of&#xD;
      iron-sulfur clusters, molecules that are essential for energy production in our cells as well&#xD;
      as repair of our genetic code embedded in DNA molecules. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and&#xD;
      deficiency of FXN results in a nerve disease affecting coordination and a condition called&#xD;
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), marked by an abnormal thickening of the heart. Patients&#xD;
      with HCM can then develop pulmonary hypertension (PH), a deadly condition of the blood&#xD;
      vessels of the lung. While most of the research in FRDA has focused on nerves and heart&#xD;
      muscle, alterations in blood vessels of the heart and lung may worsen disease in FRDA. But,&#xD;
      the role of FXN in these blood vessels has never been defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators pilot data suggest that Frataxin (FXN ) deficiency can control senescence and&#xD;
      downstream function in various types of Endothelial cells (ECs), investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) patients may demonstrate endothelial cells EC abnormalities&#xD;
      throughout the vasculature potentially before overt cardiomyopathy develops.&#xD;

      Procedure in details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have extensive experience in the performance of forearm blood flow studies&#xD;
      using strain gauge plethysmography in patient volunteers. Endothelial dysfunction will be&#xD;
      tested according to methodologies employed in our blood flow laboratories for more than a&#xD;
      decade. Strain-gauge plethysmography is used to measure forearm blood flow during infusions&#xD;
      of acetylcholine [ACh], and sodium nitroprusside [SNP] . Intra-arterial infusions of&#xD;
      acetylcholine to test endothelium-dependent blood flow. Acetylcholine acts on muscarinic&#xD;
      receptors to increase intracellular calcium levels and activate endothelial nitic oxide (NO)&#xD;
      synthase. SNP is an exogenous source of NO, to assess endothelium-independent vasodilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cumulative dose response curves will be constructed over 5-minute incremental infusions.&#xD;
      Study doctor will proceed in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SNP 0.8 1.6 and 3.2 mcg/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACh 7.5 15 and 30 mcg/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal saline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forearm blood flow (FBF) measurements in both arms will be made using venous occlusion&#xD;
      strain-gauge plethysmography prior to the initiation of any intra-arterial infusions. Blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate will be measured during the procedure through the ECG. All FBF&#xD;
      measurements will be expressed as mL/min per 100-1 mL forearm volume according to prior&#xD;
      studies and the Whitney method.1, 2 Resting baseline FBF will be measured at least 30 minutes&#xD;
      after venous and arterial catheter placement to ensure that blood flows in the cannulated&#xD;
      arms are stabilized. Study team will measure FBF during the last 2 minutes of each infusion&#xD;
      period. Infusions of individual vasoactive medications will occur over a 15-minute interval.&#xD;
      There will be a 25-minute washout between vasoactive medications. The ACh 30 mcg/min will run&#xD;
      for a total of 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of one visit. Research nurse will do the lab work once subject arrive&#xD;
      (results will take about an hour), and if eligible study team will proceed with the research&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects scheduled for the visit will report to the CTRC on the morning of testing at&#xD;
      8:00 AM. The subject will be placed in a quiet room with a where he will meet with the study&#xD;
      doctor and CRC. The study doctor will discuss with the subject the nature of the research&#xD;
      study, the risks of study participation, and participants' rights as a research subject. Then&#xD;
      will ask subject to sign consent form. After signing the consent form, the study doctor will&#xD;
      perform screening procedure which include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asking questions concerning all medications prescriptions and non-prescription&#xD;
           medications (vitamins, herbal supplements, aspirin, etc.) that are presently taking.&#xD;
           Study team will be recording all this information in the subject's research record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain a medical history and physical examination conducted by the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will record height, weight, and vital signs of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research nurse will draw blood for laboratory testing. These tests will be a complete&#xD;
           blood count (a test to make sure that subject is not anemic, or have too few red blood&#xD;
           cells), electrolytes (tests to check the chemistry levels), glucose, and clotting tests.&#xD;
           These tests will be performed to evaluate the health of subjects' body during study&#xD;
           participation. Approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons (22 mL) of blood will be collected for&#xD;
           this sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All screening results will be reviewed by the study doctor prior to the procedure. Subject&#xD;
      will be provided with any abnormal screening results so that he/she can follow up with their&#xD;
      primary care doctor for further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results of these screening reports will be read by our study doctors before initiating&#xD;
      the study, it is possible that after taking these tests subject may not be able to take part&#xD;
      in this study. The total duration of this visit is approximately 3-4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only 1 subject will be scheduled in the CTRC on any given testing day to meet appropriate&#xD;
      clinical staffing requirements for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTRC nurse will place a peripheral 20-22-gauge venous catheter in the subject's&#xD;
      antecubital vein of the non-dominant forearm for the purpose of collecting initial blood draw&#xD;
      that will be used for research. After confirmation and documentation of dual arterial&#xD;
      perfusion of the hand by an Allen's test, Dr. Risbano (co-investigator), is a critical care&#xD;
      physician and qualified in this critical care procedure with 19 years' experience of doing&#xD;
      arterial lines, will place an 20-22 brachial artery catheter in the non-dominant arm for&#xD;
      infusion and blood pressure monitoring. Any non-PI physician will be personally supervised by&#xD;
      the PI for three cannulations before allowing independent cannulation. Prior to the brachial&#xD;
      artery catheter placement 1% lidocaine will be administered by injection for local&#xD;
      anesthesia. Brachial artery catheterization is required for the strain gauge approach to&#xD;
      locally administer the drugs to the forearm arterial circulation, while limiting systemic&#xD;
      effect. The intra-arterial catheter will be connected by a 3-way stopcock to a pressure&#xD;
      transducer for blood pressure measurements and to an infusion pump. Blood Flow Measurements:&#xD;
      Heart rate, cardiac rhythm, respirations, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
      continuously monitored. Forearm blood flow measurements will be performed by means of strain&#xD;
      gauge venous-occlusion plethysmography, using methodology employed by the PI at the Vascular&#xD;
      Medicine Branch of NHLBI in many other studies. plethysmography cuff pressure is&#xD;
      intermittent. A mercury-filled Silastic strain gauge is placed around the widest portion of&#xD;
      the forearm, and connected to a plethysmograph calibrated to measure the percent change in&#xD;
      volume. The plethysmograph is connected to a strip chart recorder for forearm blood flow&#xD;
      measurements following inflation of a wrist cuff to suprasystolic pressure to exclude the&#xD;
      hand circulation. The cuff is inflated for a duration of 8-10 seconds over a 15 second&#xD;
      interval. A blood pressure cuff on the upper arm is inflated to 40 mmHg for 7 seconds with a&#xD;
      rapid cuff inflator in order to occlude venous outflow, but not arterial inflow, into the&#xD;
      forearm. This causes non invisible distention of the forearm at a rate proportionate to&#xD;
      arterial inflow. Blood pressure will be recorded directly from the intraarterial catheter&#xD;
      immediately after each series of flow measurements. The use of dual arm plethysmography will&#xD;
      allow a direct comparison of the non-instrumented arm (as a control) with the instrumented&#xD;
      arm (research procedure), and serial measurements collected every 15 seconds during the&#xD;
      research process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the research testing procedure, the study doctor will remove the venous&#xD;
      and arterial catheters. A doctor will personally perform the decannulation procedure. The&#xD;
      subject will be asked to remain in the supine position with the arm at or above heart level&#xD;
      and to keep the arm still during the procedure. The doctor will ensure that all infusions are&#xD;
      stopped and the stopcocks turned off to the patient. Any suture or tape used to secure the&#xD;
      line will be removed using standard precautions. The cannula will then be removed and firm&#xD;
      pressure held over the artery site with direct pressure of the thumb over sterile gauze for&#xD;
      approximately 10 minutes at which time the doctor will check for any bleeding from the&#xD;
      puncture site. If there is any bleeding, pressure will be held for an additional 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Once there is no bleeding, a pressure dressing with Coban will be placed over the site. The&#xD;
      subject will be instructed to remain in the supine position for an additional 10 minutes, and&#xD;
      to remain in the study room for a 30-minute observation period. The arm will again be&#xD;
      examined by the study physician prior to discharge of the subject at which time the doctor&#xD;
      will instruct them regarding care of their arm and provide them with an instruction sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Record Information: Study team will request subject's authorization to access medical&#xD;
      record information from their past, current and future medical record information related to&#xD;
      their health condition to be recorded into the Research study. This information will be&#xD;
      collected from Heart and Vascular Institute (HVI) records, hospital records and, if&#xD;
      applicable, private physician records. Since heart failure symptoms/progression may change&#xD;
      over time, and these changes may be important to this study result, future medical records&#xD;
      will be collected indefinitely. The medical record information contained within the study&#xD;
      database will be used for research related purposes for an indefinite time. Subjects medical&#xD;
      record information may be reviewed to see if they were eligible for any ongoing or future&#xD;
      research studies; if they were eligible, then study team may contact subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of family history: For individuals who have a family history of FRDA, heart or lung&#xD;
      disease, Study team may ask some basic information about other members of the family. Study&#xD;
      team will not record in the Research study any identifiable information about individuals who&#xD;
      have not signed consent to participate in this research.&#xD;
