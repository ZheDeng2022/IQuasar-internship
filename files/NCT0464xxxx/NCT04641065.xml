  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of Traditional Turkish Military music on patients&#xD;
      who will have Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography Procedure on vital signs,&#xD;
      anxiety, and pain. This will be a randomized controlled experimental study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted with two groups: the intervention group (n=64) and control group&#xD;
      (n=64). The control group will receive standard care while the intervention group, in&#xD;
      addition to standard care, will be listened to Traditional Turkish Military music, which&#xD;
      consists of music selected by an expert on the type of music, by the researchers for 15&#xD;
      minutes before the procedure.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Hour</time_frame>
    <description>VAS-A is a 10 cm long measuring instrument with the score range from 0 to 10 with 0 points showing &quot;no anxiety&quot; and 10 points showing &quot;I feel a lot of anxiety&quot;</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>VAS scale is a single-dimensional scale that is commonly used to evaluate pain severity. According to VAS, pain intensity is rated as &quot;no pain&quot; with 0 points, and &quot;the most severe pain imaginable&quot; with 10 points. Pain intensity ranges were determined by VAS as follows; mild pain below 3 points, as moderate pain between 3 and 6 points, and as severe pain above 6 points.The VAS pain scale was applied to the patients once on the first postoperative day, for the level of pain they felt.</description>
