  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver fibrosis caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is easy to progress to liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis and liver cancer, with great harm and poor therapeutic effect. Nucleos(t)ide&#xD;
      analogues (NAs) are the most commonly anti-HBV drugs currently . Long-term use of NAs can&#xD;
      inhibit HBV DNA and achieve the purpose of reducing poor prognosis. However, adverse&#xD;
      prognosis, such as liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, cannot be completely eliminated even&#xD;
      under the status of virologic inhibition under THE action of NAs. Current studies have shown&#xD;
      that the lower the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) is, the better the long-term prognosis is. As&#xD;
      another anti-HBV drug, pegylated-interferon-α (peg-IFN-α) has the immune regulation effect&#xD;
      that NAs do not have, which can bring irreplaceable effects in HBsAg reduction and liver&#xD;
      fibrosis reversal. Therefore, the combined therapy of NAs and peg-IFN-α is a hot issue in the&#xD;
      field of liver diseases over the world, but the research and application of the combined&#xD;
      therapy in patients with liver fibrosis are very few. The preliminary results of our previous&#xD;
      research showed that the combined therapy of peg-IFN-α and NAs in patients with HBV related&#xD;
      fibrosis were safe, and had a significant effect on HBsAg decline. On this basis, this study&#xD;
      intends to carry out a multicentre, randomized controlled study, comparing the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy between combined therapy (peg-IFN-α plus tenofovir) and tenofovir monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with liver fibrosis, especially focusing on HBsAg's decline and clearance, and the&#xD;
      improvement of liver fibrosis degree, in order to find a better therapy, and to guide the&#xD;
      clinical decision making.&#xD;
