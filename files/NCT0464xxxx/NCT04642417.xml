  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute symptom onset is the most common problem in colorectal cancer surgery, and it is also&#xD;
      the source of the most painful impact on patients' lives. The second is the fear of cancer&#xD;
      recurrence and complications, and psychological problems such as fear or depression are prone&#xD;
      to occur. Studies have found that colorectal cancer is gradually suffering from complications&#xD;
      and symptoms for six months, and even uncontrollable gas, leakage and incontinence, causing&#xD;
      frequent occurrence of underwear. , The body and mind are severely impacted, and affect daily&#xD;
      activities and quality of life. The problem of initial symptom management after colorectal&#xD;
      cancer surgery is highly complex, and patients even have to self-manage diseases and symptoms&#xD;
      in the face of physical and psychological adjustment. The provision and consultation of&#xD;
      knowledge and information from nursing staff can prepare patients for discharge and meet&#xD;
      their needs for knowledge and information, and can help patients achieve effective&#xD;
      self-management capabilities.The foundation of health awareness emphasizes health knowledge.&#xD;
      Health awareness is a more advanced knowledge achievement; it is the ability to make&#xD;
      judgments and decisions in daily life related to health care, disease prevention and health&#xD;
      promotion, and is the basic element of achieving self-management of health. Dietary knowledge&#xD;
      is also a higher-level knowledge, which reflects dietary knowledge in behavior, food choices&#xD;
      and criticism, and reflects on food choices and health decisions. Insufficient dietary&#xD;
      knowledge will affect food choices, judgments and decisions, resulting in insufficient&#xD;
      diet-related knowledge.Studies have confirmed that the health-related knowledge of cancer&#xD;
      patients is significantly related to disease self-management. Only when patients understand&#xD;
      their own diseases can they actively participate in self-health management. Nursing staff&#xD;
      play a pivotal role in the care of patients with colorectal cancer. Through the knowledge&#xD;
      transfer of nursing staff and guiding patients to take care of themselves, they can help&#xD;
      improve postoperative dietary intake behaviors, thereby enhancing dietary awareness.&#xD;
      Literature review of chronic disease self-management, nursing staff provide patients with&#xD;
      sufficient relevant knowledge education, which can enhance patients' self-efficacy and&#xD;
      enhance disease self-management ability.&#xD;

      Through the re-giving and encouragement of knowledge information, personal behavior control&#xD;
      and reframing can be achieved, which can be effective To promote personal health. Nursing&#xD;
      staff's consultation and face-to-face interviews can significantly improve patients'&#xD;
      health-related knowledge, effective education strategies and assist patients in&#xD;
      self-management of disease-related problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiential learning interaction can deepen the patient's impression and memory, improve the&#xD;
      patient's knowledge and skills about the disease, increase patient participation in&#xD;
      self-decision-making, improve self-efficacy, present better health-related knowledge, and&#xD;
      achieve self-management capabilities. Past studies have also found that telephone tracking&#xD;
      and consultation, emails, and giving diet manuals can help patients with colorectal cancer&#xD;
      make significant changes in their healthy diet choices.&#xD;
