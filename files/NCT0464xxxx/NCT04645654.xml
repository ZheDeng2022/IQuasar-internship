  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the efficacy of hypnosis on pain after a major abdominal surgery. The&#xD;
      aim is to further improve comfort and rehabilitation of patients after surgery, beyond the&#xD;
      usual early recovery after surgery (ERAS) enhancement protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised (1:2) to the standard of care regarding pain management and&#xD;
      rehabilitation, as part of the ERAS protocol, vs. ERAS + an additional hypnosis intervention.&#xD;
      In this group, hospitalised patients are given 3 hypnosis sessions targeting analgesia&#xD;
      between postoperative day 1 to 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect outcomes about pain and its burden, sleep quality, appetite,&#xD;
      mobilisation and mood. Secondary outcomes also include use of pain medication and length of&#xD;
      hospital stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of hypnosis as an&#xD;
      adjunct to the standard of care pain management program on postoperative pain compared to the&#xD;
      standard ERAS program. Our hypothesis is that hypnosis, as part of a multi-modal analgesic&#xD;
      management plan, will lead to decreased levels of pain compared to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary hypothesis is that better controlled pain will lead to enhanced recovery, in&#xD;
      terms of post-operative incidence of complications, physical comfort and independence,&#xD;
      psychological and emotional state and length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open label randomized controlled trial with two arms, comparing hypnosis as&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy vs. standard of care. It is a monocentric study and will take place at&#xD;
      Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), a teaching hospital in Lausanne,&#xD;
      Switzerland. It represents a collaboration between the Service of Visceral Surgery and the&#xD;
      Center of Integrative and Complementary Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited before a planned surgery, as well as in the post-surgical&#xD;
      setting. They will be screened by the study team to ensure they fulfil the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. If eligible and after informed consent is obtained, an assessment of the cognitive&#xD;
      function will be performed (cf. Chapter 4: study population). All included participants will&#xD;
      then be randomized in a 2:1 proportion to the &quot;Hypnosis (H)&quot; group or the &quot;Standard of Care&#xD;
      (SOC)&quot; group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After major abdominal surgery, all participants will benefit from a standard ERAS recovery&#xD;
      program. The ERAS protocol involves multimodal pain management with medications,&#xD;
      interventional pain therapy as needed, and psychological support if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pain has a major impact on LOS after surgery due to delayed recovery and opioid side&#xD;
      effects. Furthermore, acute pain represents a risk for chronic pain, with its massive impact&#xD;
      on quality of life and function. Interest is growing for non-pharmacological interventions as&#xD;
      part of a multimodal approach for acute pain management. Hypnosis could be a low risk,&#xD;
      cost-effective complementary therapy to improve patients' pain management, with possible&#xD;
      impact on recovery and eventually a reduction of the length of hospital stay after surgery.&#xD;
      If hypnosis is demonstrated to be an effective way to improve post-operative pain management&#xD;
      in fragile patients undergoing massive abdominal surgery, then this therapy could be offered&#xD;
      more broadly as adjunction to the actual standard of care in our teaching hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the Department of Visceral Surgery at CHUV is a teaching ward, accredited by the&#xD;
      ERAS society. Therefore, results may be used to improve patient care within the ERAS society&#xD;
      more broadly.&#xD;
