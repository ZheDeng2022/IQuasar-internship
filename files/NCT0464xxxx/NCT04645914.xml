  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survey participants are divided into a smoking and non-smoking group. The smoker group is&#xD;
      further divided according to the quantity and quality of nicotine (&quot;normal&quot; smoking, vaping).&#xD;
      After reaching a steady state, the cutaneous blood flow at rest in the extremities of all&#xD;
      participants is determined by Laser Doppler Imaging as a reference value. Laser Doppler&#xD;
      Imaging produces images of the blood flow using perfusion units (PU). Subsequently, the&#xD;
      perfusion is measured again after smoking/vaping. The difference in skin perfusion of the&#xD;
      extremities is calculated (Î´-Perfusion). All measurements are performed under controlled&#xD;
      vital parameters (body temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate) and&#xD;
      controlled room temperature as well as 15-minute acclimatization of the patients.&#xD;

      After consenting to the study, the subjects are examined using Laser Doppler Camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin blood flow of the extremities is determined as a reference value. Laser Doppler&#xD;
      Imaging produces images of the blood flow using the perfusion units (PU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements are taken under controlled vital parameters (body temperature, systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure, heart rate) and controlled room temperature as well as 15-minute&#xD;
      acclimatization of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For smokers or vapers, the perfusion is measured again after consuming a cigarette or an&#xD;
      e-cigarette respectively. The difference of blood flow after smoking or vaping is calculated&#xD;
      using both measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study per subject is approximately 25-30 minutes.&#xD;
