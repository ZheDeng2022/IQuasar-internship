  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled multi-centre study to evaluate clinical&#xD;
      performance, safety and local tolerability of initial and preventive treatment with Gedea&#xD;
      Pessary in adult women with confirmed BV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of post-menarchal, pre-menopausal females 18 years or older&#xD;
      seeking for BV symptoms (fishy smell, irritation and burning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited at study sites' gynaecological and sexual health clinics and a&#xD;
      total of 150 patients are planned to be randomised in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0, patients will have gynaecological examination, vaginal samples taken, and will be&#xD;
      randomised in a 4:1 relation to receive treatment with 6 doses of the Gedea Pessary or a&#xD;
      vehicle control (placebo) to be self-administered daily (Days 0 to 5). Patients will be re&#xD;
      examined at Day 7 (+2 days) for clinical cure rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are clinically cured at Day 7 will continue to the second part of the study and&#xD;
      will be randomised in a 1:1 relation to either Gedea Pessary or placebo treatment, to be self&#xD;
      administered once a week for a duration of 126 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients not clinically cured at Day 7 will be offered rescue treatment (metronidazole) for 7&#xD;
      days. They will return at Day 14 for clinical assessment and sampling for microbiome and&#xD;
      mycobiome analysis, and if cured they will be assessed for recurrence up to Day 128. Patients&#xD;
      that are not cured at Day 14 will be discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are clinically cured at Day 7 and continuing in Part 2 will be followed up&#xD;
      until confirmed recurrence or Day 128 if no recurrence. Vaginal samples will be taken by&#xD;
      self-swab on Days 35, 63 and 91, a visit to the clinic will be performed at Day 63 and&#xD;
      telephone follow up will be done at Days 35 and 91. Vaginal samples will also be taken at the&#xD;
      visit on the Day of potential recurrence and/or at Day 128 if no recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal samples will be used for confirming the diagnosis (Nugent score on Day 0 and Day 7)&#xD;
      and sequencing analysis of the vaginal microbiome and mycobiome (Days 0, 7, 35, 63, 91 and&#xD;
      Day of confirmed recurrence or Day 128 if no recurrence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up as regards to patient questionnaire/usability, AEs and BV recurrence&#xD;
      notification will be handled with a mobile phone application. In case of a suspected BV&#xD;
      recurrence, the patient should return to the clinic for confirmation of BV diagnosis.&#xD;
