  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Develop reliable methods for functional assessment, for both balance and trunk strength, of&#xD;
      Adult Spinal Deformity (ASD) patients and create a first clinical and normative database&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare functionality of ASD and control subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Relate functionality of ASD patients to their pathology, in terms of spinal deformity&#xD;
           and muscle condition&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Balance performance is measured by two raters to assess interrater reliability of the new scale. Patients will also return within two weeks after the first measurement and repeat the balance assessment to assess the test-retest reliability. Data on both ASD patients and Controls will also serve as a first normative and clinical database.</description>
