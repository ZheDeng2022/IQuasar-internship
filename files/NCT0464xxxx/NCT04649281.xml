  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the most common causes of healthcare contact and long-term sick leave, with&#xD;
      negative consequences on physical and mental health. Poor sleep is common in chronic pain&#xD;
      patients. Epidemiological studies indicate that 5-7% of patients with chronic pain are&#xD;
      treated regularly with strong opioids. Negative side effects of pain modulating drugs on&#xD;
      sleep quality have been reported, which may have negative influence on overall disease&#xD;
      management in chronic pain patients. However, to date there are conflicting results regarding&#xD;
      the effects of opioids on sleep, since the pain relieving effect of opioids seem to affect&#xD;
      sleep positively. There is data suggesting that physical activity has positive effects on&#xD;
      both pain perception and sleep quality (and duration). The aim of the study is to explore&#xD;
      insomnia and characteristics of sleep in patients with chronic pain and the relationship with&#xD;
      physical activity level and opioid use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      One hundred participants with planned follow-up (decision according to clinical routine) at&#xD;
      the Pain Centre will be consecutively recruited. After signed informed consent, the&#xD;
      participants will wear two accelerometers during one week, one for recording sleep and one&#xD;
      for recording physical activity. The participants will be asked to fill out a sleep and pain&#xD;
      diary during the same week. Furthermore, the participants will fill out questionnaires&#xD;
      regarding sleep, life style, mental fatigue and self-efficacy. All study participant are&#xD;
      included in the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation (SQRP). Data from the SQRP&#xD;
      will be used regarding patient health characteristics, pain and pain associated symptoms,&#xD;
      health related quality of life, sleep and self-reported physical activity level. Data&#xD;
      regarding co-morbidity, drug use, pharmacological treatment and other interventions at the&#xD;
      Pain Center will be collected from the patient charts. In addition, the participants blood&#xD;
      pressure and neck circumference will be measured. Blood samples will be analysed for&#xD;
      biomarkers associated with pain and sleep disturbance.&#xD;

    <description>Assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI consists of 19 self-rated questions which assess a wide variety of factors relating to sleep quality, including estimates of sleep duration and latency and of the frequency and severity of specific sleep related problems. The 19 items are grouped into seven component scores, each weighted equally on a 0-3 scale. The seven component score are then summed to yield a global PSQI score which has a range of 0-21; higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>
