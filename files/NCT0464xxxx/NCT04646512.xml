  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irisin is a myocin secreted by skeletal muscle in stimulus to physical exercise and has been&#xD;
      described as a possible therapeutic tool in the fight against obesity by triggering a cascade&#xD;
      of signaling that triggers the expression of genes responsible for the increase in energy&#xD;
      expenditure and browning of adipose tissue white cells by activating thermogenesis promoter&#xD;
      mitochondrial proteins. Although the science is engaged in the search for evidences about the&#xD;
      actions of the irisin, the physical exercise involved and the improvement in the levels of&#xD;
      obesity, many mechanisms are still unknown. Since taurine by means of irisin-like pathways&#xD;
      also increases energy expenditure, it is believed that taurine supplementation associated&#xD;
      with high intensity aerobic physical exercise can optimize the effects of irisin, increasing&#xD;
      energy expenditure and improving body composition in obesity.&#xD;

      Introduction: Irisin is a myocin secreted by skeletal muscle when stimulated by physical&#xD;
      exercise that promotes increased thermogenesis (browning effect). Similarly, taurine is also&#xD;
      associated with modulations of energy metabolism with promising actions in the control of&#xD;
      metabolic disorders. Thus, it is believed that chronic taurine supplementation associated&#xD;
      with physical training can optimize irisin concentrations after exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Evaluate the effects of taurine supplementation associated with interval aerobic&#xD;
      training on plasma irisin concentrations, energy expenditure, body composition and physical&#xD;
      fitness in obese women. Methods: Twenty-two women aged 25 to 45 years, sedentary, with grade&#xD;
      I obesity (BMI ≥30-35 kg / m²) and without comorbidities will be recruited for the study. The&#xD;
      subjects will be submited to a high intensity interval aerobic training for 8 weeks, being 3&#xD;
      times by week, for 50 minutes, associated to the supplementation with 3g of taurine or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Assessment of dietary intake, Resting Energy Expenditure (GER) by indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry, body composition by deuterium oxide, anthropometric measurements, HPLC plasma&#xD;
      analysis of taurine, multiplex irisin and physical fitness variables will be performed pre&#xD;
      and post intervention. The results will be expressed as mean and standard deviation and the&#xD;
      ANOVA test two way repeated measures mixed model will be applied, with post hoc Sidak, to&#xD;
      verify differences and statistical interactions (p &lt;0.05).&#xD;
