    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes most cases of infectious mononucleosis (mono). Up to 1 in 10&#xD;
      people who get mono can have fatigue that lasts more than 6 months. One out of 100 people can&#xD;
      have severe complications. EBV is also associated with several types of cancer. Researchers&#xD;
      want to test an EBV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety of and immune response to a new vaccine against EBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-29&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will give a&#xD;
      blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a dose of the study vaccine as an injection in a muscle in the upper&#xD;
      arm. They will be observed for 30 to 60 minutes. Blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate,&#xD;
      and temperature will be checked. The injection site will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a diary card. They will write down any side effects they have after the&#xD;
      vaccine dose, or they may use an electronic diary card. Participants will be asked to write&#xD;
      down or enter any important medical events that may occur at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a vaccine dose at 2 more study visits. They will have 4 follow-up&#xD;
      visits at different times after a vaccine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 6 telephone calls in between the in-person visits. They will also have&#xD;
      1 telephone call 1 year after the third dose of vaccine. If possible, this visit can occur in&#xD;
      person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last about 18 months. There is an optional in-person visit or telephone&#xD;
      call 2 years after the third dose of vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gp350-Ferritin nanoparticle vaccine adjuvanted with Matrix-M1. Forty&#xD;
      healthy volunteers will be enrolled and dosed in this trial: 20 EBV seropositive participants&#xD;
      and 20 EBV seronegative. Each participant will receive 3 intramuscular doses of vaccine on&#xD;
      Days 0, 30, and 180. Follow-up visits will occur after each dose of vaccine either in person&#xD;
      or by telephone contact. In addition to vaccine dosing days, mandatory in-person visits will&#xD;
      occur in the first week after the first dose of vaccine, 1 month after the second and third&#xD;
      doses of vaccine, and 6 months after the third dose of vaccine. The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      assessment of safety and includes solicited injection site and systemic reactions related to&#xD;
      vaccination that occur in the 7-day period after each vaccination, unsolicited adverse events&#xD;
      occurring up to 30 days after each vaccination, and serious adverse events through 1 year&#xD;
      after the third dose of vaccine. A mandatory telephone, optional in-person, contact will&#xD;
      occur 1 year after the third dose of vaccine (Day 540) to collect information about medically&#xD;
      attended events and significant new medical conditions to assess for possible autoimmune&#xD;
      disease that may be related to the adjuvant, Matrix-M1. An optional visit may occur 2 years&#xD;
      after the third dose of vaccine (Day 900) to collect similar medical information and possibly&#xD;
      assess durability of immune responses to vaccination. The primary endpoint for immunogenicity&#xD;
      is the change in log10 antibody responses to EBV from baseline to 1 month after the third&#xD;
      vaccine dose as measured by an neutralization assay. Secondary immunogenicity endpoints are&#xD;
      the change in log10 antibody responses to EBV gp350 from baseline to 1 month after the third&#xD;
      vaccine dose as measured by a luciferase immunoprecipitation assay and the change in log10&#xD;
      CD4 T cell responses to EBV gp350 from baseline to 1 month after the third dose as measured&#xD;
      by an intracellular cytokine staining assay. The estimated duration of this study will be&#xD;
      about 4 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 18 to 29 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Screening procedures and evaluations performed no more than 30 days prior to scheduled&#xD;
             administration of the first vaccine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the active phase of the study (approximately 18 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willingness to allow storage of blood and saliva for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In good general health as evidenced by medical history, physical examination, and&#xD;
             laboratory screening result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is willing to forgo receipt of a licensed, live vaccine in the 30 days&#xD;
             preceding each dose of vaccine or in the 30 days following each dose of vaccine. An&#xD;
             FDA-approved inactivated, subunit or replication-defective flu vaccine and/or a&#xD;
             COVID-19 vaccine approved under emergency use authorization can be used &gt;=14 days&#xD;
             before or &gt;=14 days after administration of the study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For females of reproductive potential who are sexually active with a male partner: use&#xD;
             of highly effective continuous contraception for at least 30 days prior to Day 0 and&#xD;
             agreement to continue use until 180 days after the last dose of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For males who are sexually active with partners of child-bearing potential: use of&#xD;
             highly effective continuous contraception from Day 0 and agreement to continue use&#xD;
             until 90 days after the last dose of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Contraceptive requirements: Because the effects of EBV gp350-Ferritin vaccine on the&#xD;
             developing human fetus are unknown, sexually active female participants of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraception as outlined&#xD;
             below before study entry and until 6 months after the last dose of vaccine. Females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before receiving each dose&#xD;
             of the EBV gp350-Ferritin vaccine. During the course of the study, if a participant&#xD;
             becomes pregnant or suspects they are pregnant, then they should inform the study&#xD;
             staff and their primary care physician immediately. Acceptable forms of contraception&#xD;
             are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intrauterine device (IUD) or equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal contraceptive (e.g. consistent, timely, and continuous use of&#xD;
                  contraceptive pill, patch, ring, implant, or injection that has reached full&#xD;
                  efficacy prior to dosing). If the participant uses a contraceptive pill, path, or&#xD;
                  ring, then a barrier method (e.g. male/female condom, cap or diaphragm plus&#xD;
                  spermicide) must also be used at the time of potentially reproductive sexual&#xD;
                  activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A stable, long-term monogamous relationship with a partner who does not pose any&#xD;
                  potential pregnancy risk, e.g. has undergone a vasectomy at least 6 months prior&#xD;
                  to the first dose of vaccine or is of the same sex as the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A hysterectomy and/or a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
             Acceptable forms of contraception for male participants include one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condom plus spermicide, used before or during sexual intercourse, even if the&#xD;
                  female partner uses a contraceptive pill, patch, or ring&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A vasectomy completed at least 6 months before the first dose of vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Continuously and completely abstaining from sexual intercourse with a female with&#xD;
                  child-bearing potential from the first dose of vaccine until 3 months after the&#xD;
                  last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Acceptable contraception for female partners with child-bearing potential of male&#xD;
             study participants include one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IUD or equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal contraceptive (e.g. pill, patch, ring, implant or an injection used&#xD;
                  consistently and that has reached full effect prior to the first dose of vaccine)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hysterectomy and/or a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
