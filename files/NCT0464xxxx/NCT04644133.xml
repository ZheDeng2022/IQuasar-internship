  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective here is to improve the patient's compliance and accurate capture of patient&#xD;
      reported bowel and abdominal symptoms, by utilizing a phone application that interactively&#xD;
      records each bowel movement or leakage event and other bowel symptoms. Such an electronic&#xD;
      stool diary may relieve the burden of using a paper daily stool diary. We will compare and&#xD;
      validate the electronic stool diary with the paper stool diary.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence consists of multiple and often unpredictable bowel movements and leakage&#xD;
      of stool. Chronic constipation is associated with episodes of irregular and unpredictable&#xD;
      bowel habits and difficulty with remembering symptoms. These features lead to a recall bias,&#xD;
      and inaccurate recollection and/or documentation of symptoms that are critical for diagnosis&#xD;
      and management. A daily stool diary has been used in clinical trials and in clinical practice&#xD;
      to accurately record bowel symptoms. However, patients find these diary entries cumbersome or&#xD;
      embarrassing to use, especially with bowel movements that occur outside of home resulting in&#xD;
      loss of data or inaccurate collection of information. Also, many patients forget events&#xD;
      especially when this bowel habit is irregular. Therefore, it is crucial to explore new ways&#xD;
      of accurately, reliability, and more discretely collect bowel habit information, by using&#xD;
      current technology that a majority of people have access to.&#xD;
