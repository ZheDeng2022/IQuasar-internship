  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combining cognitive training with physical training to improve balance is a new approach for&#xD;
      reducing the risk of falls in patient populations who are at risk for falls. People with&#xD;
      brain pathology including cerebellar ataxia (CA) have difficulty in performing dual-tasks.&#xD;
      Deficiency in dual-task performance relative to single-task performance referred to as&#xD;
      dual-task cost is high in CA. Due to the high demands on cognitive resources, people with CA&#xD;
      have higher falls rates during activities that involve dual tasking. Tai-Chi involves both&#xD;
      cognition and physical movements making it a dual-tasking activity. However, previous study&#xD;
      on the effects of 12-weeks of 8-form Tai-Chi did not demonstrate that it had beneficial&#xD;
      effects in reducing falls among CA population. This null finding could potentially be due to&#xD;
      (1) the lower levels of cognitive demands of Tai-Chi exercise, (2) the intervention not being&#xD;
      intensive enough, or (3) the intervention may not have targeted the specific symptoms of CA.&#xD;
      To determine if adding structured cognitive demands to conventional balance and coordination&#xD;
      training (i.e., addressing all three possibilities for our previous null findings), the&#xD;
      investigaotrs conducted a pilot study (n=5) to evaluate the feasibility, safety and benefits&#xD;
      of a Cognitive-coupled Intensive Balance Training (CIBT) program. The more intensive and&#xD;
      focused CIBT intervention reduced dual-task cost, improved balance, and reduced the number of&#xD;
      falls in a sample of individuals with CA. Important next steps is to (1) evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the CIBT in a fully powered clinical trial, (2) understand the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the benefits of CIBT training, and (3) determine the cost-benefits of this&#xD;
      intervention. The hypothesis for the study includes (1) CIBT will improve balance and reduce&#xD;
      falls; (2) reduction in dual-task cost of balance and cognitive performance will mediate a&#xD;
      reduction in the number of falls in CA and (3) CIBT will be a cost-effective treatment option&#xD;
      for improving balance and reduce falls. To test these hypotheses, a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) with economic evaluation will be conducted over a period of two years to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dual-task (CIBT) training compared with&#xD;
      single-task (conventional balance: active control) training in individuals with CA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frequent falls in people with cerebellar ataxia (CA) is a significant problem because it&#xD;
      increases the burden of disease to both the individual and the healthcare system. Therefore,&#xD;
      an intervention that could improve balance and reduce the number of falls is of paramount&#xD;
      importance from the patients' perspective. Although the incidence of CA in the population is&#xD;
      not as high as the other neurological disorders such as stroke and Parkinson's disease, the&#xD;
      disability and its negative impact on quality of life are significant for those suffering&#xD;
      from CA. Moreover, research that results in more knowledge regarding the factors that&#xD;
      contribute to falls and the efficacy of treatments that reduce falls in this population could&#xD;
      inform research into fall prevention in other populations of individuals at risk for falls,&#xD;
      including otherwise healthy elderly adults. Individuals with CA have poor coordination,&#xD;
      balance and postural control; all of these contribute to them having frequent falls. People&#xD;
      with CA also present with varying degrees of cognitive impairments making it difficult for&#xD;
      them to perform dual-tasks in daily activities. Dual tasking has been found to deteriorate&#xD;
      the performance of either or both tasks in people with CA. The deficiency in dual-task&#xD;
      performance relative to single-task performance referred to as dual-task cost is high in CA.&#xD;
      Falls incidence in people with CA increases during daily activities that involve dual&#xD;
      tasking. Tai-Chi is a form of dual-task training. Previous study of the Tai-Chi to improve&#xD;
      balance and prevent falls in people with CA found some beneficial effects of Tai-Chi on&#xD;
      improving balance, but it did not reduce falls incidence. The investigaotrs speculate the&#xD;
      lack of beneficial effects of Tai-Chi on falls incidence was due to the Tai-Chi intervention&#xD;
      being inadequately intense, especially with respect to its cognitive demand. Other available&#xD;
      interventions to improve balance and reduce falls do not address the dual-task cost of&#xD;
      balance performance in this population. However, dual-task training is found to reduce&#xD;
      dual-task cost and reduce falls in people other neurological disorders and therefore has the&#xD;
      potential to reduce falls in CA. To evaluate this possibility, the investigators developed&#xD;
      and piloted the Cognitive-coupled Intensive Balance Training (CIBT) that combines cognitive&#xD;
      demand to intensive balance and coordination training for reducing the dual-task cost of&#xD;
      balance and cognitive performance, improve balance and consequently reduce the number of&#xD;
      falls. The pilot study found that CIBT is safe, feasible and potentially effective in&#xD;
      reducing the dual-task cost of balance performance, improving functional balance and reducing&#xD;
      falls in people with CA. Evaluating the efficacy of this program in a fully powered clinical&#xD;
      trial and understanding the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of the CIBT on balance&#xD;
      and falls are important next steps of our research program. Here the investigators propose a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the treatment benefits of the dual-task&#xD;
      (experimental: CIBT) training against the single-task (active control: conventional balance,&#xD;
      coordination and cognition) training for reducing dual-task cost, improving balance and&#xD;
      reduce the number of falls in participants with CA, evaluating both the efficacy and the&#xD;
      mechanisms of dual-task training. In addition, the investigators propose to conduct an&#xD;
      economic evaluation alongside the RCT at a healthcare perspective of Hong Kong to compare the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of dual-task training against single-task training, in preparation for the&#xD;
      development of any future trials. This study finding will have important clinical&#xD;
      implications by clarifying if adding a cognitive demand to routine balance and coordination&#xD;
      training will result in additional benefits on improving balance and reducing falls in&#xD;
      comparison with usual care in people with CA. The findings will also have important&#xD;
      implications for increasing the efficacy of falls prevention programs in other populations&#xD;
      with neurological deficits who are at risk for falls. Our specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of the dual-task (CIBT- experimental) training&#xD;
      compared with single task (conventional intensive balance, coordination and cognitive- active&#xD;
      control) training on functional balance and number of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Both dual-task and single-task training will improve functional balance,&#xD;
      however, the dual-task training will be more effective in reducing the number of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To identify the mechanism underlying the effectiveness of the dual-task training&#xD;
      on functional balance and the number of falls; that is, to evaluate the extent to which&#xD;
      treatment-related changes in the functional balance and dual-task cost of balance and&#xD;
      cognitive performance mediate the reduction in the number of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Improvement in functional balance resulting in the reduction of number of falls&#xD;
      will be mediated by the reduction in the dual-task cost of balance and cognitive&#xD;
      performances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Compare the cost-effectiveness of the dual-task and single-task training for&#xD;
      preventing falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Dual-task training will be superior in terms of cost-effectiveness than the&#xD;
      single-task from a health-care perspective of Hong Kong&#xD;
