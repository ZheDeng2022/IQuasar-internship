  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To achieve appropriate exposure for an anterior neck surgery (for example an Anterior&#xD;
      Cervical Discectomy and Fusion or ACDF), patients are positioned supine with their neck&#xD;
      extended. Due to being in this position, patients frequently complain of posterior neck&#xD;
      stiffness and pain postoperatively in addition to the anterior incisional pain. This&#xD;
      posterior cervical pain can be classified as myofascial pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical myofascial pain is thought to be the result of overuse or trauma to the supporting&#xD;
      muscles of the neck and shoulders. Trigger point injections are one of the methods used to&#xD;
      treat myofascial pain. The trigger point injection procedure is where a physician (typically&#xD;
      an anesthesiologist) performs an exam of the patient neck and upper back and finds areas of&#xD;
      point tenderness. The physician will then inject a small amount of numbing medication (such&#xD;
      as bupivacaine) into the muscle or tissue in that area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trigger point injections have been shown to be superior to botox injections or dry needling,&#xD;
      and equivalent to physical therapy. However, these studies were performed on patients with&#xD;
      chronic neck pain. There are no studies evaluating the effectiveness of trigger point&#xD;
      injections on post anterior cervical surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At our institution, trigger point injections with local anesthetic are used as part of a&#xD;
      multimodal pain control regimen for post-anterior cervical surgery patients. Our hypothesis&#xD;
      is if the addition of trigger point injections to standard of care multi-modal post-operative&#xD;
      pain control will decrease patients' myofascial pain, and thereby decrease the amount of&#xD;
      narcotic pain medication used.&#xD;

    <description>Trigger point injections will be performed within an hour of arrival in PACU, given that the patient has adequately woken up from general anesthesia. Injections will be performed by an anesthesiology provider using a standardized technique under strict aseptic conditions. The trigger point will be located between two fingers, and a 1-2cm sterile needle with a thickness of 25 or 26 gauge inserted at 30 degrees with respect to the skin. Negative aspiration will be confirmed before injecting the study solution. The needle will be withdrawn to the subcutaneous tissue and redirected superiorly, inferiorly, laterally and medially, injecting study solution at each location. Pressure will be applied to the area to ensure hemostasis, and the area dressed with gauze and tape as needed.</description>
