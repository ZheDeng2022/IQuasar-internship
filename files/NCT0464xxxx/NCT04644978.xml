      Background: Many people think that people with mental disorders might be dangerous or&#xD;
      unpredictable. These patients face various sources of disadvantages and experience&#xD;
      discrimination on job interviews, in education, and housing. Mental health-related stigma&#xD;
      (MHS) occurs not only within the public community, it is a growing issue among professionals&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: We designed a prospective, observational, multi-centre, international study of 35&#xD;
      European countries to investigate the MHS among medical specialists and trainees in the field&#xD;
      of general adult and child and adolescent psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: An internet-based, anonymous survey will measure the stigmatizing attitude by using&#xD;
      the local version of the Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Health Care Providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presentation of the Results: The results of the research will be published in an&#xD;
      international peer-reviewed journal. Furthermore, we will present the results on national and&#xD;
      international conferences.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a rising interest for the examination of the MHS that has been mostly studied among&#xD;
      community people. Numerous international studies have shown that people with mental illness&#xD;
      are considered to be unpredictable and dangerous (Corrigan et al, 2005). These people often&#xD;
      experience disadvantages in various situations, like job interviews, in education, and&#xD;
      housing (Corrigan et al, 1998; Thornicroft et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MHS has been much less examined among medical professionals and psychiatrists; however,&#xD;
      studies have shown that it is prevalent among them as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent multi-centre study (Harangozó et al., 2014) collected the positive and negative&#xD;
      experiences of 777 people with schizophrenia about the access to healthcare services in 27&#xD;
      countries. More than 17% of the patients experienced some kind of discrimination due to their&#xD;
      mental illness when they sought medical care for physical problems. More than 38% felt that&#xD;
      the medical staff was disrespectful during psychiatric services. Higher discrimination was&#xD;
      found within the former Eastern Bloc countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, psychiatrists tend to be more empathetic towards people with mental illnesses;&#xD;
      however, the MHS could be observed among them as well. A few studies have also shown that&#xD;
      their attitude is more negative than that of community people (Wahl et al., 2010; Henderson&#xD;
      et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the ambiguous results and the lack of studies focusing on the stigmatizing attitude&#xD;
      of psychiatrists, we aimed to examine this important issue among medical professionals of the&#xD;
      mental health field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to investigate the stigmatizing attitudes and behaviours of adult psychiatric and&#xD;
      child and adolescent psychiatric professionals and trainees towards people with mental&#xD;
      illness in European countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of our study will contribute to the expansion of the existing knowledge both on&#xD;
      national and international levels. The outcome could be used for the development of&#xD;
      anti-stigma programs and the improvement of therapeutic options in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structure of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is cross-sectional and multi-centred across 35 European countries. We would like to&#xD;
      measure the extent of the stigmatizing attitude and its relationship with psychosocial&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sociodemographic measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  sociodemographic data: age, sex&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  professional data: workplace categories (university, psychiatric hospital,&#xD;
                outpatient service, research centre); location of the workplace (capital, county&#xD;
                seat, rural town, small town, village); years of the professional experience;&#xD;
                current psychotherapeutic activity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  personal information (related to a stigmatizing attitude): mental illness known in&#xD;
                his/her family or close friend, previous treatment for own mental illness,&#xD;
                attending in psychotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  National version of the Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An online questionnaire will be provided for the participants of our study. Participation in&#xD;
      the study is voluntary and it can be terminated at any time without having to give any&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;

    <description>The main questionnaire is the Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) which is a self-report questionnaire that contains 15 statements describing feelings and opinions about people with mental health problems. . In the survey, the subjects indicate on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 5 = &quot;strongly agree&quot;) the extent they identify themselves with the given statement.&#xD;
The overall stigmatising attitude of the participants is described with the total score of the scale (minimum of 15, and a maximum of 75 points). Besides the total score, three dimensions can be calculated by evaluating the three subscales of the questionnaire (Attitude, Disclosure and Help-seeking, and Social Distance).&#xD;
Higher scores on a subscale and higher total scores reflect a more stigmatising attitude.</description>
