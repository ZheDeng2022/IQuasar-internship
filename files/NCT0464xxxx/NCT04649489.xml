  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment strategies for HCC with PVTT is still controversial, and differ substantially&#xD;
      between the west and the east. According to western guidelines, including those of the EASL,&#xD;
      BCLC, and AASLD, PVTT is regarded as a contra-indication to initial surgery or transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCC with PVTT consists of heterogeneous populations with different disease behaviors and&#xD;
      prognoses. As a result of recent concept evolution and advances in surgical techniques and&#xD;
      perioperative management, emerging evidence shows that selected patients with PVTT may&#xD;
      benefit from more aggressive treatment modalities, which are recommended for by Chinese,&#xD;
      Japanese, South Korean, and Asia Pacific clinical practice guidelines. A national survey from&#xD;
      Japan showed median overall survival with liver resection treatment to be 1.77 years longer&#xD;
      than with nonresection therapies, which included TACE, radiotherapy, sorafenib, or&#xD;
      conservative treatment (2.87 years vs 1.10 years, respectively; p&lt;0.001). After&#xD;
      propensity-score matching of patient baseline characteristics, median overall survival since&#xD;
      diagnosis in the liver resection group was 0.88 years longer than in the non-resection group.&#xD;
      In a large-scale, multicentre, propensity-score matched analysis from China, surgery was the&#xD;
      best treatment for patients with Cheng's type I and II PVTT with Child-Pugh A and selected B&#xD;
      liver function. Median overall survival after liver resection (745 of 1580 patients) was 15.9&#xD;
      months (95% CI 13.3-18.5 months) for Cheng's type I PVTT and 12.5 months (10.7-14.3 months)&#xD;
      for Cheng's type II PVTT. Thus, aggressive surgical resection in selected patients with HCC&#xD;
      with vascular invasion, as proposed by several tertiary health-care centers in the east,&#xD;
      seems to be reasonable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no dedicated clinical trials to study the value of hepatic resection in&#xD;
      this population. Furthermore, cumulative evidence indicates that long-term overall survival&#xD;
      after hepatic resection alone remains unsatisfactory because of the high rate of tumor&#xD;
      recurrence and correspondingly low rate of disease-free survival. The combination of&#xD;
      perioperative therapies may be more efficacious to improve the prognosis in selected&#xD;
      population. More high-level evidence of novel multimodality treatment should be generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will enroll HCC patients with PVTT CNLC Stage IIIa, who have no prior anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment. Given the poor prognosis and limited treatment options for these patients, this&#xD;
      population is considered appropriate for trials of more aggressive and novel therapeutic&#xD;
      candidates in the initial treatment setting. The benefit risk profile for hepatic resection&#xD;
      combined with perioperative atezo/bev in this patient population is expected to be favorable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, two-arm, randomized study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of surgical resection plus peri-operative atezo/bev compared with&#xD;
      continuous systemic atezo/bev in HCC patients with PVTT and without EHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially eligible patients (see inclusion criteria for study entry) will be enrolled into&#xD;
      induction phase, during which they will receive 3 cycles of atezo/bev and 1 cycle of atezo&#xD;
      alone as primary systemic therapy. Tumor response assessment using computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be conducted by the Independent-Review Facility&#xD;
      (IRF) according to RECIST v1.1 after cycle 2 and cycle 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients who are assessed as partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) and considered&#xD;
      suitable for curative hepatic resection (see randomization criteria) will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to one of the following two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A (experimental arm): hepatic resection with post-operative atezolizumab 1200mg and&#xD;
           bevacizumab 15mg/kg, both administered by IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B (control arm): atezolizumab 1200mg and bevacizumab 15mg/kg, both administered by&#xD;
           IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed after the second tumor assessment and stratified according to&#xD;
      the following stratification factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  - Tumor response: target lesion reduction (maximum diameter reduction ≥10% compared with&#xD;
           the entry baseline) vs non-reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 0 vs 1 Those patients&#xD;
           who are assessed as disease progression (PD) or complete response (CR) and/or not&#xD;
           suitable for curative hepatic resection will be excluded from randomization and treated&#xD;
           according to local practice (Patients without PD may continue atezo/bev treatment at&#xD;
           investigators' discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Arm A, surgery is performed 0-2 weeks after the randomization (i.e., 6-8 weeks after the&#xD;
      last dose of preoperative bevacizumab). The first dose of postoperative treatment is&#xD;
      recommended to start within 4-8 weeks after surgery. Surgical approaches will be tailored to&#xD;
      the individual patient according to local standards with the goal of achieving R0 resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab will continue until loss of clinical benefit&#xD;
      (determined by the investigator), or unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of Informed Consent&#xD;
      Form (ICF), death, or the study is terminated by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. For Arm&#xD;
      A, whether to continue atezo/bev treatment will be determined by the investigator at the end&#xD;
      of the 12-month treatment period (approximately 17 cycles) if none of the above occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, &quot;study treatment&quot; refers to the treatments assigned to patients as part of&#xD;
      this study (i.e., hepatic resection plus peri-operative atezo/bev in Arm A, or atezo/bev in&#xD;
      Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, baseline measurements are the last available data obtained prior to the&#xD;
      patient receiving the first study treatment either in the induction phase (entry baseline) or&#xD;
      after randomization (randomization baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments will be performed in induction phase after cycle 2 and cycle 4&#xD;
      (randomization baseline), and in treatment period at regular intervals (since randomization,&#xD;
      every 6 weeks for the first 54 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter for both arms). Additional&#xD;
      scans will be performed as clinically indicated. Following completion or discontinuation of&#xD;
      the treatment, information on recurrence or disease progression, survival and subsequent&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapies will be collected until death, loss to followup, withdrawal of ICF or&#xD;
      study termination by Sponsor, whichever occurs first. In the absence of disease recurrence or&#xD;
      progression, tumor assessments should continue regardless of whether patients start a new&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy, until documented treatment failure events (see efficacy objective),&#xD;
      withdrawal of ICF or study termination. All patients will be followed for survival unless&#xD;
      consent is withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. An IRF will be used to enable&#xD;
      centralized, independent reviews of images and other clinical data (e.g., histopathology,&#xD;
      tumor markers etc.) used for assessment of HCC response, recurrence and disease progression.&#xD;
      IRF reviews will be performed prior to the pre-specified efficacy analyses. IRF membership&#xD;
      and procedures will be detailed in an IRF Charter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has&#xD;
             not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no&#xD;
             identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due to&#xD;
             surgical sterilization (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes and/or uterus), or&#xD;
             other causes as determined by the investigator (e.g., Müllerian agenesis). The&#xD;
             definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local&#xD;

             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If required per local&#xD;
             guidelines or regulations, locally recognized acceptable methods of contraception and&#xD;
             information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local&#xD;
             Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;

             treatment period and for at least 6 months after the final dose of bevacizumab to&#xD;
             avoid exposing the embryo. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same&#xD;
             period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration&#xD;
             of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of preventing drug exposure. If required per&#xD;
             local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in&#xD;
             the local Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
