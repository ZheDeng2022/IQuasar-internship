  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigate the effects of flax beverage consumption on memory and cognition in subjects with&#xD;
      memory deficit (i.e., amnestic MCI). In addition, it will correlate PET scan results (for a&#xD;
      limited number of participants) and blood biomarker data with memory test results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multisite, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to examine&#xD;
      the effect of daily flax beverage consumption on memory and cognition. This trial will be&#xD;
      conducted at the I.H. Asper Clinical Research Institute and at the John Buhler Research&#xD;
      Centre, Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty men and women diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) aged 60 to 84 years will&#xD;
      be recruited by using advertisements/flyers, radio/TV announcements, the Alzheimer's Society&#xD;
      network and/or will be referred by a general practitioner. The participants will be randomly&#xD;
      divided: 30 subjects in the flax-treatment group and 30 placed in the control - placebo&#xD;
      group. For 180 days (6 months) participants will either consume 2 servings of 330 ml of flax&#xD;
      beverage (treatment group; 30 gms flax/day beverage) or placebo beverage (i.e. normal fiber&#xD;
      beverage; control) per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential candidates will first be screened in-person at the I.H. Asper Clinical Research&#xD;
      Institute; the screening visit (SV1) will last about 2 hours. The subject will first be asked&#xD;
      to read, understand and sign a consent form. Then they will be subject to a questionnaire, a&#xD;
      medical history, a blood pressure (BP) measurement and 2 screening memory &amp; cognition tests;&#xD;
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which is sensitive to MCI and the Depression Anxiety&#xD;
      Stress Scale (DASS). Based on this initial in-person visit, investigators will determine&#xD;
      participants' eligibility to continue in the study. Study staff will contact the Office of&#xD;
      Clinical Research at St. Boniface Hospital to assign an eligible participant a unique study&#xD;
      code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant meets the inclusion criteria based on their SV1 visit, investigators will&#xD;
      plan a baseline visit for the participant. During the first baseline visit (BV1), if the&#xD;
      subject is interested to take part in this study, they will be asked to perform the Cambridge&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). This baseline visit will take about 1.0&#xD;
      hours to accomplish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will then plan a second baseline visit (BV2) for a fasting blood draw, which&#xD;
      will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. The participant will have to fast for 10&#xD;
      hours prior to their visit and a certified phlebotomist will collect approximately 16 mL of&#xD;
      blood (about 3 teaspoons). In addition, investigators will review beverage consumption logs&#xD;
      with participants and provide 30 days of beverage regime if they have a vehicle to take it&#xD;
      home (if they have a car and are not scheduled for a PET scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third baseline visit will be scheduled (BV3), where some participants will be randomly&#xD;
      invited for a brain PET scan (10 controls from the placebo group and 10 from Flax-treatment&#xD;
      group) at the baseline and at the end of the study. For this procedure the participant will&#xD;
      need to fast for 4 hours. The participants have the option of declining the PET scans, if&#xD;
      they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will need to be provided with 30 days of flax beverage every month (by&#xD;
      either pickup or delivery). They also will need to submit their consumption log sheets&#xD;
      (requested monthly) at this time to be reviewed by a study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, the participants (T180) will have final follow up review of their&#xD;
      medical history, blood pressure measurements and memory and cognitive tests (similar to those&#xD;
      performed at the screening visit and baseline visit 1), along with a fasting blood draw (FV1,&#xD;
      FV2). In addition, a third final study visit (FV3) will be scheduled for those who agreed to&#xD;
      brain PET scans at the beginning of the study. In the final visit, an honorarium of $25.00&#xD;
      will be paid for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will visit the I.H Asper Clinical Research Institute a minimum of 5 times&#xD;
      for the entire study. Those participants selected for brain PET scan will have 2 additional&#xD;
      visits at John Buhler Research Centre, Health Sciences Centre; therefore, they will need a&#xD;
      total of 7 visits for the entire study.&#xD;

    <description>Pizzey Ingredients Inc. introduced a flax beverage product that is a plant-based beverage product that is designed as an alternative to non-diary &quot;milks&quot; (almond milk &amp; soy milk).
