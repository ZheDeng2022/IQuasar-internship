  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to compare the efficiency of Mulligan mobilization technique and&#xD;
      cervical stabilization training in patients with chronic neck pain. The results obtained from&#xD;
      the study will contribute to the planning of the treatment of patients with chronic neck pain&#xD;
      more effectively.&#xD;

      The aim of our study is to compare the efficiency of Mulligan mobilization technique and&#xD;
      cervical stabilization training in patients with chronic neck pain. The results obtained from&#xD;
      the study will contribute to the planning of the treatment of patients with chronic neck pain&#xD;
      more effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses we will test for this purpose; H1. Home exercise program will improve&#xD;
      positively after treatment in patients with chronic neck pain compared to before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2. Mulligan mobilization will improve positively after treatment in patients with chronic&#xD;
      neck pain compared to before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3. Cervical stabilization training will improve positively after treatment in patients with&#xD;
      chronic neck pain compared to before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4. Mulligan mobilization will provide more effective results in patients with chronic neck&#xD;
      pain compared to other applications.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale. The Visual Analogue Scale is a horizontal scale in the range of 0-10 cm, where 0 is the lowest pain and 10 the highest pain. The patient will be asked to mark the pain felt in the neck area on this line and the point marked will be measured with a ruler and recorded in cm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Neck Disability will be measured by Neck Disability Index. The Neck Disability Index is a frequently used scale to evaluate the level of disability due to neck pain. It consists of 10 items and 6 options under each item. Options are scored between 0-5 points. An increasing score indicates a higher level of disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical Range of Motion will be assessed by Baseline Bubble Inclinometer as degree of flexion-extension, rotation and lateral flexion and will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Head Posture</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Head posture will be evaluated using the craniovertebral angle. The decrease in the craniovertebral angle indicates an increased anterior head posture.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proprioception</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;joint position sense error test&quot; defined by Revel et al. Will be used to evaluate cervical proprioception.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Cervical Deep Flexor Muscle Endurance Test&quot; will be used.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Awareness</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Fremantle Neck Awareness Questionnaire, which consists of few and short questions, does not take time, is easy to access, evaluates neck perception, attention and proprioceptive awareness, will be used. An increase in the score obtained from the questionnaire indicates a decrease in neck awareness.</description>
