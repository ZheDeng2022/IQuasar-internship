  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to determine whether lemborexant increases the apnea&#xD;
      hypopnea index (AHI) on Day 8 of treatment in adult and elderly participants (adults greater&#xD;
      than or equal to [&gt;=] 45 to less than [&lt;] 65 years; elderly &gt;=65 to 90 years) with moderate&#xD;
      to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) compared with placebo, and using pulse oximetry&#xD;
      determine whether lemborexant decreases the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) during total&#xD;
      sleep time (TST) on Day 8 of treatment in adult and elderly participants (adults &gt;=45 to &lt;65&#xD;
      years; elderly &gt;=65 to 90 years) with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) compared with placebo.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>AHI is defined as the average number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. AHI will be assessed using polysomnography (PSG). The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014) defines the severity of OSA according to the AHI: an AHI &gt;5 to &lt;15 is classed as mild, AHI &gt;=15 to &lt;30 as moderate, and AHI &gt;=30 as severe.</description>

    <description>SpO2 is an estimate of the amount of oxygen in the blood. It is the percentage of hemoglobin containing oxygen compared to the total amount of hemoglobin in the blood (that is, oxygenated hemoglobin versus oxygenated and non-oxygenated hemoglobin). SpO2 is monitored by noninvasive method known as transmissive pulse oximetry. TST is defined as the total time asleep in minutes using PSG.</description>
