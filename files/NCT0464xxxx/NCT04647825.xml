      For one-third of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy alternative approaches must be&#xD;
      investigated in order to improve the quality of their life. A possible approach is to find&#xD;
      automatic methods to detect/predict seizures, in order to adopt interventional actions to&#xD;
      stop or abort the seizure or to limit its side effect. The main problem in this case is to&#xD;
      evaluate the reproducibility of such methods and to standardize them, because there is a lack&#xD;
      of availability of long-term electroencephalography (EEG) data. In this study we want to&#xD;
      create a large long-term EEG database, called NEED (Neuromed Epilepsy EEG Database), whos aim&#xD;
      is to give researchers a way to test their method in a large collection of data. The database&#xD;
      will contain long-term EEG recordings of 200 patients as well as extensive metadata and&#xD;
      standardized annotation of the data sets and will be made freely available for the download&#xD;
      to the research community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 50 million people worldwide are affected by epilepsy, which is one of the most frequent&#xD;
      neurological diseases. It is characterized by unpredictable and sudden seizures which could&#xD;
      led to loss of consciousness and uncontrolled motor reactions, severely impacting the quality&#xD;
      of life of epilepsy patients. Only two-thirds of epilepsy patients can control seizures with&#xD;
      anti-epileptic drugs or through epilepsy surgery. For the remaining patients, other&#xD;
      therapeutics approaches should be considered. These approaches include the development of&#xD;
      interventional closed-loop device, able to detect seizures and trigger an interventional&#xD;
      operation, such as administer anti-epileptic drugs or electrically stimulate the&#xD;
      epileptogenic focus to abort the seizure. In order to provide efficient therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches to these patients, in the last decades many efforts have been made to develop&#xD;
      automatic methods to find reliable markers in electroencephalographic (EEG) signal, which is&#xD;
      the gold standard for epilepsy diagnosis, able to predict or early detect seizures in EEG.&#xD;
      Such methods are based on mathematical or computational approaches for EEG signal analysis,&#xD;
      whose aim is to extract complex measures (the so-called &quot;features&quot;) from EEG signal, which&#xD;
      are not recognizable with classical visual inspection of EEG signals made by epileptologists&#xD;
      during the diagnosis of epilepsy, in order to use such features as precursors of incoming&#xD;
      seizures (seizure prediction) or as indicators of an ongoing seizure (seizure detection).&#xD;
      Many methods have been proposed in the last years, using linear or non-linear, to extract&#xD;
      features from EEG signal. Recently, some studies used also electrocardiographic signal (ECG),&#xD;
      which is normally recorded together with EEG in epilepsy monitoring, in order to extract&#xD;
      promising features from it. Although these studies showed promising results, nevertheless&#xD;
      they suffer of many limitations. Among them, the use of a limited number of patients and&#xD;
      seizures and the use of only recordings belonging to the phase preceding the seizures (the so&#xD;
      - called pre-ictal period). Such limitations do not allow to determine, for example, the&#xD;
      specificity of such algorithms, because they don't consider also recordings acquired in time&#xD;
      intervals far from the seizures (inter-ictal data) and could led to a overfitting of the&#xD;
      seizure prediction/detection model. The only thing on which all the researchers on epilepsy&#xD;
      agree is the existence of a pre-ictal phase, which is the phase preceding the seizure, the&#xD;
      ictal phase, where the seizure is &quot;active&quot; and inter-ictal phase, which is a period&#xD;
      temporarily far from the seizure. Normally, automatic methods for seizure&#xD;
      prediction/detection consist of three different phases: the pre-processing (artifact removal,&#xD;
      band-pass filtering, data segmentation, …) of EEG signals, feature extraction and feature&#xD;
      selection and classification. This last step usually consists in the use of machine-learning&#xD;
      and statistical methods in order to make decision about the prediction/detection. Basically,&#xD;
      these models should be able to classify each EEG instance in two classes, &quot;seizure&quot; or &quot;no&#xD;
      seizure&quot;, using the features extracted from EEG signal. The efficacy of these models highly&#xD;
      depends on how efficiently they are trained and normally the more are the data used to&#xD;
      trained them, the more they are able to take the right decision. Therefore, the availability&#xD;
      of large database of data could allow to develop efficient models for epilepsy&#xD;
      detection/prediction. The possibility for researchers to have access to large database of&#xD;
      continuous and long-term EEG data of epilepsy patients could be a big opportunity to develop&#xD;
      efficient and reliable automatic seizure prediction/detection methods. For these reasons, in&#xD;
      the last years some research groups have proposed and shared public EEG database with&#xD;
      researchers who wants to test their automated seizure detection/prediction models. In&#xD;
      particular, such database have been proposed by Epilepsy Center of University of Bonn and&#xD;
      Freiburg and also by Children's Hospital of Boston and have been made available for free&#xD;
      downloading to researchers. These databases contain long-term EEG recordings acquired during&#xD;
      pre-surgical monitor of epilepsy patients. The number of patients included in these databases&#xD;
      is quite low (from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 23 patients) and also the number of&#xD;
      seizures is limited (from a minimum of 59 to a maximum of 189). Furthermore, the duration of&#xD;
      the recordings ranges from 40 minutes to 142 hours and the number of metadata (other&#xD;
      information about patients and seizures) is very low. The last database has been proposed in&#xD;
      2008 in the framework of a EU-founded project (EPILEPSIAE), in which 6 different partners&#xD;
      (hospitals, universities, companies) of 4 different countries (Germany, Italy, France,&#xD;
      Portugal) have been involved. This database is not free but is made available for the&#xD;
      download upon payment in 2012. Nowadays, it is the largest epilepsy EEG database available&#xD;
      worldwide (http://epilepsy-database.eu/). It contains data from 275 patients, including EEG&#xD;
      and ECG recordings, metadata, clinical and technical annotations on the data and clinical&#xD;
      information about the patients. Actually, only 60 out of 275 datasets are available for the&#xD;
      download. The aim of this study is to create a long-term EEG database acquired on epilepsy&#xD;
      patients during the non-invasive presurgical monitor at Epilepsy Surgery Unit at IRCCS&#xD;
      Neuromed. The database will include, besides EEG and ECG recordings, clinical and technical&#xD;
      annotations on the data made by expert epileptologists and also clinical information about&#xD;
      the patient, including neuropsychological evaluations. All the data will be first anonymized,&#xD;
      crypted and then made available for the free download. The database will include data from&#xD;
      200 epilepsy patients underwent non-invasive presurgical epilepsy monitoring at Epilepsy&#xD;
      Surgery Unit at IRCCS Neuromed. At the end of non-invasive EEG monitoring, two expert&#xD;
      epileptologists will inspect EEG/ECG data in order to identify the seizures, in particular&#xD;
      the channels where the seizure starts and the time, and everything could be of interest for&#xD;
      the project. All the recordings will be exported in ASCII (American Standard Code for&#xD;
      Information Interchange) format using the DMS Data Management System (Nihon Kohden Europe&#xD;
      Gmbh) software, version 2.9.8 and stored locally. At the same time, clinical and demographic&#xD;
      (only gender and age) data will be acquired for each patient. In particular, for each patient&#xD;
      the following data will be available:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data (gender and age);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical information (epilepsy type, seizure frequency,…);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EEG data acquired according to international 10-20 system;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information about the recordings and the seizures (start and end time, start and end&#xD;
           time of each seizure, …)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data from all the patients will be included in a single database, and each patient will&#xD;
      be stored in a single compressed archive. The database will be made available after the&#xD;
      completation of a request which can be forwarded by each researcher using a dedicated URL, in&#xD;
      which the researcher will fill in a form when it will be asked to provide the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information about the applicant (name, address, affiliation, …)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GDPR consent Once the request will be received, the compressed archive containing the&#xD;
           whole database will be protected with an ad-hoc alphanumeric password. Such password&#xD;
           will consist of two parts: the first part will be sent by email to the applicant, the&#xD;
           second part will be sent using the regular mail service (two-way authentication).&#xD;
