  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Synovitis has an important role in the symptoms and progression of Osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;
      Inflamed synovium has been associated with both increased symptoms and increased progression&#xD;
      in OA patients. Furthermore, synovitis observed during knee arthroscopy in our patients&#xD;
      undergoing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) was associated with worse symptoms while&#xD;
      adjusting for confounding factors.Therefore, a better understanding of synovitis as a&#xD;
      predictor of outcome after APM and as a target for treatment is needed to improve outcomes in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triamcinolone has been shown to decrease synovitis-associated outcomes in both animal and&#xD;
      human studies after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. In a porcine model of ACL&#xD;
      injury, treatment with triamcinolone resulted in decreased formation of synovitis-related&#xD;
      collagen breakdown products as well as decreased cellularity of the synovium.And in a trial&#xD;
      of triamcinolone injected after ACL injury, similar findings of decreased C-telopeptide of&#xD;
      type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with collagen type II breakdown, was found in knees&#xD;
      administered triamcinolone compared to placebo controls.&#xD;

      Symptomatic meniscal tear with pain and mechanical symptoms of catching and locking ,a&#xD;
      phenotype of early OA, and often prompts patients who have failed physical therapy to elect&#xD;
      APM to improve their symptoms. This arthroscopic surgery presents a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      evaluate the intraarticular status of the joint including joint fluid biomarkers and synovial&#xD;
      tissue for signs of inflammation in patients with mild to moderate OA. Since no post-op&#xD;
      tissue repair is desired after APM, in contrast to other post-traumatic OA (PTOA) models such&#xD;
      as anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the APM cohort can be used to test novel&#xD;
      interventions to slow down PTOA development by suppressing synovitis and inflammation.&#xD;
      Results from this trial in this patient population could be applied to the broader population&#xD;
      of many millions of patients with mild to moderate OA who never undergo arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently approximately 1,000,000 APMs performed in the United States each year,&#xD;
      and about 70 percent of patients have a clinically significant improvement in symptoms after&#xD;
      surgery. Much of this variation in outcome is unexplained but is hypothesized to be related&#xD;
      to synovitis and joint inflammation that is currently unmeasured and untreated in usual&#xD;
      clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial of extended release triamcinolone for efficacy to&#xD;
      improve patient reported outcome measures after APM. The investigators will evaluate joint&#xD;
      fluid and synovial tissue biomarkers to assess joint inflammation as a predictor of treatment&#xD;
      response, use quantitative 3T MRI to evaluate cartilage and meniscus composition and 3D bone&#xD;
      shape, which are sensitive imaging markers for early joint degeneration, and use a&#xD;
      prospective surgical episode data collection system to capture patient reported outcomes and&#xD;
      surgeon reported operative data.&#xD;

    <description>The purpose of this intervention is to determine the use of extended release steroid knee injection (Zilretta) at the end of the surgery and its effects on your knee pain.In this study Zilretta will be injected intra-operatively for your arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) surgery.Participants will have MRIs x-rays, and provide a sample of the synovial fluid from both knees at the beginning of surgery. This fluid is drained at the beginning of surgery and then usually discarded. Three samples each of blood and urine will be collected over the study period from each participant and sample of joint (synovial tissue) taken. Participants will be asked to answer questions about knee pain.</description>
