  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ME-APDS is a device (software-based with hardware) developed by Magentiq Eye LTD and intended&#xD;
      to support the decision of the endoscopist on polyps which appear in the colonoscopy video&#xD;
      during the colonoscopy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized two arm colonoscopy trial will mainly compare APC and APE between Magentiq&#xD;
      Eye Assisted Colonoscopy (MEAC) and Conventional Colonoscopy (CC) in patients referred for&#xD;
      either screening or surveillance colonoscopies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present study is to compare the number of Adenomas Per&#xD;
      Colonoscopy (APC) and the Adenomas Per Extraction (APE) between the Magentiq Eye-Assisted&#xD;
      Colonoscopy (MEAC) and Conventional Colonoscopy (CC). These are also the co-primary&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are Adenoma Miss Rate (AMR, tested on part of the total study&#xD;
      population) and Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study mainly hypothesizes that more adenomas will be detected in MEAC compared to CC&#xD;
      (higher APC in MEAC compared to CC), and that the reduction of APE in MEAC compared to CC (if&#xD;
      there will be a reduction) will be limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also assumes that AMR will be reduced in MEAC compared to CC and that ADR will&#xD;
      increase to some level in MEAC compared to CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 952 subjects . Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      into two groups, group A and B. In group A, patients will be examined with CC. Patients in&#xD;
      group B will be examined using MEAC. Immediately after the randomization, a sub-randomization&#xD;
      will be performed on whether an immediate second examination (for AMR calculation) will be&#xD;
      conducted or not (136 patients will undergo second examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonoscopy will be performed in accordance with the standard of care of each medical&#xD;
      center in either MEAC or CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the colonoscopy procedure patients will be observed at the endoscopy unit until the&#xD;
      discharge criteria are met as per the standard clinical protocol of the medical center. After&#xD;
      here, they will be discharged by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study follow-up period will be up to 30-days post-colonoscopy to register (serious) adverse&#xD;
      events and it will be in accordance with the standard of care of medical center.&#xD;
