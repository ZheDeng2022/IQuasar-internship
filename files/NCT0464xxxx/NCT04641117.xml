      Participants will be 60-80 y men and women who vary their physical activity (steps/day) while&#xD;
      their lipid metabolism is studied (n=24). Thereafter, another group (n=60) will perform 6&#xD;
      months of exercise training focused on developing maximal cycling power, during which their&#xD;
      changes in muscle mass and practical function will be carefully measured.&#xD;

      In a society that is growing in the number of older adults who are also becoming more&#xD;
      sedentary, it is critical to identify the types of exercise that harness significant health&#xD;
      benefits. First, we hypothesize that older adults (60-80 y) need a certain background level&#xD;
      of physical activity, judged by number of steps per day. This is important, especially to fat&#xD;
      metabolism. Secondly, because older adults claim they don't have time to exercise, we have&#xD;
      developed a time efficient program (10 min/day) that has shown promise for offsetting&#xD;
      sarcopenia and significantly improving cardiovascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Aim 1 is to determine the range of daily step counts in older adults (60-80 y; n=24) that&#xD;
      is needed to prevent acute impairment of post-prandial fat metabolism, measured the morning&#xD;
      after exercise. We have recently shown in young adults that when their level of background&#xD;
      physical activity drops below the range of 5,000 - 8,500Â±500 steps/d, that they don't adapt&#xD;
      positively to an acute 1 h bout of exercise (i.e.; 'exercise resistance') that normally&#xD;
      improves fat metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Aim 2 is to determine the ability of a time-efficient 24-week program of exercise&#xD;
      training for both maximal neuromuscular power and aerobic power to counteract sarcopenia and&#xD;
      declines in aerobic power and functional tests in men and women 60-80 y. We have recently&#xD;
      found in a preliminary study of older men and women (50-70 y) that performing multiple&#xD;
      maximal 4 s sprints of rapid acceleration cycling bouts for only 8 weeks, eliciting maximal&#xD;
      power, displayed significant (p&lt;0.05) increases in muscle thigh volume (MRI), whole body&#xD;
      muscle mass, maximal neuromuscular power and peak oxygen consumption. We now propose to train&#xD;
      older men and women (i.e.; 60-80 y; n=60) for longer durations (i.e.; 24 weeks) and describe&#xD;
      the time course of adaptations. We will additionally monitor their background levels of daily&#xD;
      physical activity and determine if it correlates with improvements in neuromuscular and&#xD;
      cardiovascular function.&#xD;
