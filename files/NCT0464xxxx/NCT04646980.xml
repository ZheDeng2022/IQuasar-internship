  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is a seasonally-epidemic viral infection causing 3-5 million severe illnesses and&#xD;
      up to approximately 500,000 annual deaths around the world. Influenza-like illnesses (ILI) is&#xD;
      a simple constellation of symptoms and signs that was introduced to capture influenza cases&#xD;
      in surveillance system. The elderly are more susceptible to cancers and viral infections&#xD;
      including influenza infection and complications that was attributed to the phenomenon of&#xD;
      immunosenescence or age-associated decline of immune system activity. Biobran/MGN3 is a&#xD;
      natural nutritional supplement that was shown to exhibit potent immunomodulator effect such&#xD;
      as enhancement of natural killer cell (NKC) activity and up-regulating the production of&#xD;
      cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and -lambda&#xD;
      (IFN-λ). The protective effect of Biobran/MGN-3 against viral infection such hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as well as several cancer types has been&#xD;
      previously reported in experimental animal models and humans. The objective of the current&#xD;
      study was to investigate the effect of Biobran/MGN-3 on some innate immune system components&#xD;
      and the incidence of ILI in the older adult population. The studied innate immune system&#xD;
      included NKC activity and the expressions of intracellular viral nucleic acid sensors such as&#xD;
      retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5)&#xD;
      and some of their downstream signals such as ISG15 and MX1.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current study investigated the effect of oral supplementation with Biobran/MGN-3, 500 mg&#xD;
      every day for 3 months, on several components of innate immune system and the incidence rate&#xD;
      of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in older adults population. The study protocol conformed to&#xD;
      the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approval by Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board (IRB) at the Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Egypt. Zagazig University&#xD;
      Hospitals serves over 1 million residents in Zagazig district and neighboring towns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study spanned the time period from November 2018 till the end of February 2019, a period&#xD;
      with known peak incidence of ILI attacks. Subjects of ≥ 56 years were recruited from the&#xD;
      visitors of outpatient clinics at Zagazig University Hospitals. The age of ≥ 56 years was&#xD;
      used by the WHO to define old age in African nations. In addition, this age is close to&#xD;
      public service retirement in Egyptian society, which is associated with significant social,&#xD;
      mental, and psychological stress and therefore could be associated with significant decline&#xD;
      in NK cell activity. Only local residents of Zagazig district were recruited to the study so&#xD;
      as to reduce the dropout rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originally 90 subjects, both males and females, were approached but only 80 subjects, 40&#xD;
      males and 40 females, continued the study. Ten of the recruits refused to participate when&#xD;
      they realized that the sachets were only labeled with the manufacture symbols without printed&#xD;
      names, which was used to ensure double-blinding. Informed consents were obtained from all&#xD;
      participants and their right to unconditionally withdraw from the study at any time were made&#xD;
      clear to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and females were randomly assigned into two groups (n=40/group) that received either&#xD;
      placebo or Biobran/MGN-3 (500 mg/day for 3 months). Both the health care giver and the&#xD;
      participants were blinded to the ingested supplement. Participants' health was monitored via&#xD;
      weekly home visits and they were instructed to report any complaints or side effects by phone&#xD;
      to the health care giver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of ILI was made by documenting the incidence of acute respiratory illness with a&#xD;
      measured temperature of ≥ 38 °C with cough (3). After diagnosis, the subject was helped to&#xD;
      follow the proper health management plan by the health care giver. During the study, all&#xD;
      participants were required not to take any vitamins or medications during the study without&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of Biobran/MGN-3 on liver, kidney, and hematological parameters were monitored.&#xD;
      Liver functions were monitored using alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) and aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), whereas kidney function was monitored using serum uric acid. The&#xD;
      assessed hematological parameters included red blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit value&#xD;
      (HCT), hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and&#xD;
      total and differential (WBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NKC activity was measured using the well documented degranulation assay. The viral nucleic&#xD;
      acid receptors, RIG-1 and MDA5, and their downstream target, ISG15 and MX1, were assessed&#xD;
      using flowcytometry in BEAS-2B cells.&#xD;

    <description>Biobran/MGN3 is defined by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) as a food supplement. Biobran/MGN3 is manufactured by hydrolyzing rice bran with the enzymatic extract of medicinal Shiitake mushrooms. Enzyme hydrolysis of rice bran produces arabinoxylane, a hemi-cellulose compound, which constitutes the active ingredient of biobran/MGN3.</description>
