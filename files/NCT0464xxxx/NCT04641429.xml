      This study investigates the effects of exercise on older people's cognitive and affective&#xD;
      functions, and the possible underlying neurobiological pathways.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Population aging is accelerating. The socioeconomic burden associated with an aging&#xD;
      population calls for timely action for promoting brain health. The human brain has the&#xD;
      capacity for plastic reorganization through learning and experience. Physical activity could&#xD;
      induce plasticity and is important in the prevention of functional decline and increased&#xD;
      survival. In this study, the effects of Qigong and stretching exercise on affective and&#xD;
      cognitive function among the healthy elderly are investigated. This study is proposed to&#xD;
      invite 200 participants (100 in each intervention condition). The investigators acquire data&#xD;
      from questionnaires, assessments, neurocognitive tests, magnetic resonance imaging and blood&#xD;
      samples at baseline (before the intervention) and post-intervention.&#xD;
