  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The alcohol consumption of adults has been decreasing in France since the sixties. When&#xD;
      focusing on the particular case of women, this trend goes on the opposite direction. In&#xD;
      addition, the impact of drinking alcohol involves an increased severity in women in&#xD;
      comparison to men. Furthermore, women consult less often doctors about their alcohol problem&#xD;
      due to stigmatisation. Finally, as alcohol consumption is a major public health issue (second&#xD;
      preventable cause of death), the aim of this study is to propose an earlier screening of&#xD;
      women with alcohol use disorders (AUD) in general medicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      To improve the screening of women with AUD in general m√©dicine, from their perceptions and&#xD;
      experiences, and to create a screening tool to general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chosen method is a qualtitative study through semi-structured interview with women with&#xD;
      AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative assessment of these individual interviews could show various topics.&#xD;
