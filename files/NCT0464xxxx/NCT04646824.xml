  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason for the study is to find out if an experimental combination of an oral medication&#xD;
      called Almonertinib when used in combination with chemotherapy is more effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Some lung cancers are&#xD;
      due to mutations in the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which, if known, can help physicians&#xD;
      decide the best treatment for patients. One type of mutation can occur in the gene that&#xD;
      produces a protein on the surface of cells called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor&#xD;
      (EGFR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total the study aims to enroll approximately 36 patients who will receive almonertinib in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy in the main trial. The study involves a Screening Period,&#xD;
      Treatment Period, and Follow up Period. Whilst receiving study medication, it is expected&#xD;
      patients will attend, on average, approximately 15 visits over the first 12 months and then&#xD;
      approximately 4 visits per year afterwards. Each visit will last about 2 to 6 hours depending&#xD;
      on the arrangement of medical assessments by the study centre.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. The tumor harbors 1 of the 2 common epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations&#xD;
             known to be associated with Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) sensitivity (Ex19del or L858R), either alone or in combination&#xD;
             with other epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, which may include T790M.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have untreated advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) not amenable&#xD;
             to curative surgery or radiotherapy.&#xD;
