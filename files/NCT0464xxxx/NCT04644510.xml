  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major barrier to ultrasonography in general practice (GP) is the time restriction of their&#xD;
      medical consultation. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of lung ultrasonography (LUS)&#xD;
      realized by general practitioners (GP's) into their medical consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, observational, multi-centric and open study conducted in 3 different centers&#xD;
      by 15 GP in France. Patient receiving LUS were recruited from December 2019 to January 2020.&#xD;
      GP's were all novices and received a training course by LUS expert before the study.&#xD;
      Eight-points LUS exam was recorded, timed, and interpreted by GP's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the 111 LUS performed, 110 LUS were interpreted. Time duration was 4 (3-5) min with 13%&#xD;
      of LUS superior to 5 minutes. There was no significant difference in time duration after&#xD;
      stratification by age. Patients were mainly satisfied after receiving LUS, and 80% of&#xD;
      patients had a better understanding about their disease due to US realization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this first prospective, and multicenter study, involving patients consulting in General&#xD;
      Practice, we found that LUS seems to be feasible by GP's in a medical consultation. We showed&#xD;
      that LUS can be performed fast enough for a GP consultation, and easy to learn. These&#xD;
      findings will need to be valided in a randomized and controlled study.&#xD;
