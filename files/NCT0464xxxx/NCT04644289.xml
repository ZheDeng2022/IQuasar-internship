  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, open-label, phase II trial. Patients with suspected&#xD;
      advanced ovarian cancer planned to undergo diagnostic laparoscopy for histologic confirmation&#xD;
      and evaluation of disease spread will be registered into the trial after providing a 1st&#xD;
      written informed consent.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total, 60 patients are planned to be enrolled in 2 consecutive cohorts (30 patients per&#xD;
      cohort) into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After histologic confirmation of high-grade epithelial non-mucinous, non-clear cell ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, patients will be treated in two consecutive cohorts (A, B) of 30 patients each, with&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) olaparib alone or B) olaparib in combination with durvalumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment allocation will take place in two consecutive cohorts rather than by randomization.&#xD;
      This will allow to evaluate the safety and feasibility in a stepwise approach. A trial&#xD;
      steering committee (TSC) meeting will take place between the cohorts to review safety and&#xD;
      feasibility prior to starting the second cohort. The safety follow-up of the first cohort&#xD;
      will take 90 days as of the first dose of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The window-of-opportunity treatment phase will be followed by primary debulking surgery and&#xD;
      standard of care platinum based first-line chemotherapy at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of first-line chemotherapy patients who have not progressed during&#xD;
      first-line chemotherapy will be offered maintenance treatment with olaparib for 24 months (or&#xD;
      according to label).&#xD;
