      Robotic-arm assisted surgery aims to reduce errors and improve accuracy for implant position&#xD;
      in total hip arthroplasty (THA). In THA implant positioning plays a pivotal role in good&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and reduces long-term wear, therefore, technology has been developed to&#xD;
      help surgeons achieve more accurate implant position consistently. Computer-assisted&#xD;
      navigation provides surgeon with knowledge to help guide surgeons intra-operatively with some&#xD;
      systems computed tomography (CT)-based, others fluoroscopy based, and others imageless&#xD;
      systems. Computer navigation has been shown to accurately place components, but does not&#xD;
      provide the ability for patient specific pre-operative planning that CT- based robotics&#xD;
      allows. While some may argue that robotic-arm assisted THA is more accurate, others argue&#xD;
      that the cost and learning curve associated with robotic-arm assisted THA is not more&#xD;
      accurate with no long-term clinical benefits. Robotic arm-assisted THA has been shown to&#xD;
      improve accuracy of component placement and reduce outliers. Kayani et al reviewed 100 cases&#xD;
      performed by a single surgeon with 50 THAs performed manually and 50 robotic arm-assisted. In&#xD;
      this study, Kayani did not find a learning curve associated with achieving accuracy using the&#xD;
      robotic arm-assisted technology; however, there was a 12 case learning curve for both himself&#xD;
      and his operating staff that increased operative time [9]. Nodzo et al evaluated the use of&#xD;
      the robotic arm-assisted THA using post-operative CT scans and found that both the acetabular&#xD;
      and femoral component position were significantly accurate when compared to the intra-op&#xD;
      position. Kamara et al reviewed a single surgeon case series to assess acetabular accuracy&#xD;
      and found that 76% of manual THAs were within the surgeons' target zone compared to 97% of&#xD;
      his robotic arm-assisted THAs, concluding that adoption of robotic arm-assisted THA provided&#xD;
      significant improvement in acetabular component positioning during THA. Similarly, Redmond et&#xD;
      al found that although there was a learning curve associated with robotic arm-assisted THA,&#xD;
      operative time decreased with experience and acetabular component outliers decreased&#xD;
      suggesting that while there is a learning curve with robotic arm-assisted THA the clinical&#xD;
      benefits are better implant positioning and decreased outliers. Illgen et al reported that&#xD;
      the improved acetabular accuracy in robotic arm-assisted THA significantly reduced&#xD;
      dislocation rates when compared to manual THA. Bukowski et al reported robotic arm-assisted&#xD;
      THA clinical outcomes at a minimum of 1 year and found that patients who underwent a robotic&#xD;
      arm-assisted THA has higher clinical outcomes compared to a manual group, however, there have&#xD;
      been no large multicenter studies that assess clinical outcomes after robotic arm-assisted&#xD;
      THA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conjunction with numerous other patient-specific and surgical factors, such as age, sex,&#xD;
      comorbidities, surgical approach, component selection, and impingement, component positioning&#xD;
      is often cited as an important factor in optimizing THA stability. Lewinnek et al. defined&#xD;
      the &quot;safe zone&quot; for component position as 40⸰±10⸰ of cup inclination and 15⸰±10⸰ of cup&#xD;
      anteversion to minimize dislocation risk. However, recent studies have shown that not only do&#xD;
      components continue to dislocate when placed in this zone, but that the majority of THA&#xD;
      dislocations are positioned in this safe zone to begin with. Compounding this issue is the&#xD;
      growing body of evidence showing that the acetabular component is not static in nature, as&#xD;
      was the assumption with Lewinnek's safe zone, but rather dynamically changing with movement&#xD;
      of the pelvis and spine during postural and positional changes. Alterations of the dynamic&#xD;
      relationship between the hip, spine, and pelvis in patients with hip-spine pathology during&#xD;
      movements such as transitioning from standing to sitting affects typical pelvic biomechanical&#xD;
      accommodation, resulting in THA component impingement, instability, and dislocation.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients with spinopelvic pathology secondary to arthritis, spinal fusion, or&#xD;
      spinal deformity are more prone to dislocation and revision following primary THA. The&#xD;
      standard modality for assessing hip component position postoperatively is a 2D&#xD;
      anteroposterior radiograph, due to low radiation dose and low cost. However, hip replacement&#xD;
      components are placed in a 3-dimensional pelvis and femur, and therefore an anteroposterior&#xD;
      radiograph alone may not give accurate information on the anteversion of the acetabular or&#xD;
      femoral component. Studies have shown that cup anteversion measured with radiographs can have&#xD;
      serious deviations with a substantial error range (mean deviation +1.74°, range -16.6° to&#xD;
      29.8°). This is attributed to the fact that radiographs cannot control for pelvic rotation&#xD;
      and/or tilt. Recently a limited number of studies have started to use the other imaging&#xD;
      modalities for understanding pelvic tilt in patients undergoing hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
