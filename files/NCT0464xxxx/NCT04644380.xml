    <textblock>
      The INVOcell Culture Device received de novo request for 3-day intravaginal incubation. The&#xD;
      device is held in place with the intravaginal cavity by a Retention Device. The clinical&#xD;
      study will assess the ability of a modified Retention Device to hold INVOcell in place during&#xD;
      5-day vaginal incubation as well as comfort and vaginal irritation as secondary endpoints.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label non-comparative prospective trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      retention of the INVOcell IVC with the Retention Device over the vaginal incubation period of&#xD;
      up to 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the retention of the INVOcell IVC device with the&#xD;
      Retention Device over the vaginal incubation period of up to 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Retention of the INVOcell IVC device with the Retention Device over the vaginal incubation&#xD;
      period of up to 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comfort of the INVOcell IVC and Retention Device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaginal tissue reactions during the vaginal incubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical clarity and the ability to visualize the embryos after the incubation&#xD;
