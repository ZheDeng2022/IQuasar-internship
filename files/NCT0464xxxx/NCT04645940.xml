    <textblock>
      This study will be a single center, open label, 3-period, randomized 2-sequence study&#xD;
      conducted with 14 healthy male or female subjects. The study will consist of a Screening&#xD;
      Phase (Screening and Day -1), a Treatment Phase (Periods 1, 2, and 3), and an End of Study&#xD;
      (EOS) Phase. For Periods 1 and 2, subjects will be randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment&#xD;
      sequences, with all subjects then moving to the same treatment in Period 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periods 1 and 2: 14 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 possible&#xD;
      treatment sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fed/Fasted: fruquintinib 5 mg with food on Day 1 and fruquintinib 5 mg without food on&#xD;
           Day 15&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting/Fed: fruquintinib 5 mg without food on Day 1 and fruquintinib 5 mg with food on&#xD;
           Day 15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 3: all subjects will take rabeprazole 40 mg orally once daily in the morning from Day&#xD;
      23 to Day 29. On the morning of Day 29, all subjects will take rabeprazole 40 mg orally&#xD;
      without food one hour before taking a fruquintinib 5 mg oral dose. Subjects will continue to&#xD;
      fast until lunch.&#xD;

&#xD;
