      Background: Office blood pressure (OBP) is used for diagnosing and treating hypertension but&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) associates more accurately with patient outcome.&#xD;
      The optimal blood pressure in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is still unknown.&#xD;
      Our objective was to investigate whether physician awareness of ABP after percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) improved BP-control. Methods: A total of 201 patients performed&#xD;
      ABPM before and after their PCI follow-up visit. Patients were randomized to open (O) or&#xD;
      concealed (C) ABPM results for the physician at the follow-up visit. The change in ABP and&#xD;
      antihypertensive medication in relation to baseline ABP was compared between the two groups.&#xD;

      Study design and patient population We included 225 patients scheduled for follow up after an&#xD;
      acute or elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at the Department of Cardiology at&#xD;
      the Karolinska University Hospital 2009-2015. Exclusion criteria were age &lt;18 or &gt;90 years.&#xD;
      Information on medical history, date and indication for PCI were collected from the medical&#xD;
      records, by the study physician (OH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were subject to ABPM at baseline (3-6 weeks after PCI) and follow up (11-18&#xD;
      weeks after PCI. At the time of the first ABPM the patients also completed a questionnaire&#xD;
      about smoking habits and current antihypertensive drug treatment. Weight (kg) and height (cm)&#xD;
      was measured. At the clinical follow up visit one to two weeks later they were assessed by a&#xD;
      cardiologist not involved in the study. At this visit ABPM results were either used or not&#xD;
      according to randomization in the decision making for adjustments in antihypertensive&#xD;
      medication. The cardiologists were provided with reference values for ABPM according to&#xD;
      guidelines.26,27 For those with concealed ABPM-results the OBP was used for decision making&#xD;
      regarding changes in antihypertensive treatment. Finally, results regarding BP control were&#xD;
      assessed at the second ABPM 8-12 weeks following the first measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Office Blood pressure measurement OBP was recorded in both arms by a biomedical scientist or&#xD;
      a specialized nurse (study staff) using a mercury sphygmomanometer with the subject in the&#xD;
      supine position after 5 min of rest. The mean of two consecutive readings was calculated. If&#xD;
      there was a difference in systolic or diastolic BP (SBP, DBP) between the arms of &gt;10 mmHg,&#xD;
      the arm with the highest reading was used when defining OBP, otherwise the non-dominant arm&#xD;
      was used. The same arm was used at the follow up where either the physician or a nurse&#xD;
      measured OBP after having been given instructions for standardized BP measurement as&#xD;
      described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory BP Ambulatory BP values were obtained using a noninvasive oscillometric system&#xD;
      (Spacelabs 90217, Spacelabs Healthcare, Hertford, UK). The device was fitted to the patient&#xD;
      by one of the study staff. Patients were instructed not to restrict their daily activities&#xD;
      during the monitoring periods. Before the start of the monitoring period, the automatic&#xD;
      readings were cross-checked against manually measured BP by auscultation. The device was&#xD;
      fitted to the nondominant arm, unless a difference of &gt;10 mmHg in SBP between the arms was&#xD;
      recorded, in which case the arm with the highest pressure was used. BP and heart rate were&#xD;
      recorded automatically every 20 minutes' daytime and every hour at night for a 24-h period.&#xD;
      The BP data was auto-edited by the Spacelabs program, which excluded presumably erroneous&#xD;
      data. No manual editing of data was carried out in order not to induce bias. Means were&#xD;
      calculated for the whole 24-h period, and for day (07.00-21.00) and night (24.00-06.00)&#xD;
      periods separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antihypertensive drug treatment The agents according to guidelines26 27 classified as BP&#xD;
      lowering were thiazide- and potassium saving diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists,&#xD;
      ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers and others (doxazocin only one used). At the&#xD;
      follow up antihypertensive treatment changes were reported by the physician in the study&#xD;
      protocol. The patients' current antihypertensive treatment was also documented prior to the&#xD;
      2nd ABPM by the study staff. All antihypertensive treatment was further recorded as a&#xD;
      percentage of recommended maximal daily doses, to allow for calculation of treatment change.&#xD;
      The latter was calculated as the difference in antihypertensive treatment between prior to&#xD;
      the physician follow up and ongoing medication at the 2nd ABPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Mean and standard deviation (SD) were used for numerical data whereas&#xD;
      median and range was used for the number of days until follow-up visit and the number of&#xD;
      BP-lowering agents. Chi-square-tests or Fishers exact test were used to compare ratios&#xD;
      between groups where the variables were nominal. Independent t-tests were used to compare&#xD;
      continuous variables between groups, since the variables investigated were normally&#xD;
      distributed. In order to study whether the intervention optimized BP across the distribution&#xD;
      of baseline ABP, a multivariate analysis was performed and the interactions between study&#xD;
      groups on the association between baseline ABP and change in ABP as well as change in&#xD;
      antihypertensive therapy was calculated. Separate analysis was performed in the diabetic&#xD;
      subgroup. A p-value &lt;0.05 were used to define statistical significance. Statistical analysis&#xD;
      was done in the StatSoft program STATISTICAÂ®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Ethical approval was applied for and approved by the Stockholm&#xD;
      Regional Ethical Review Board, reference number 2008/1017-31. All subjects gave informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
