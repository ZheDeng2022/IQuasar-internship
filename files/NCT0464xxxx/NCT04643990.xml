  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is an important public health problem in the world. There are still&#xD;
      more than 250 million chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infected people in the world. Its&#xD;
      preventive effect has reached a relatively ideal effect, but its therapeutic effect still has&#xD;
      great room for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenofovir(TDF) is the first-line antiviral treatment with good clinical efficacy. However,&#xD;
      some patients who take TDF for a long time have different degrees of renal dysfunction, which&#xD;
      limits the use of TDF in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenofovir Alafenamide Fumarate (TAF) has better plasma stability and stronger liver&#xD;
      targeting, and reduces the side effects of renal function damage and bone mineral density&#xD;
      reduction. Telbivudine (LDT), a nucleoside analogue, has the advantages of rapidly reducing&#xD;
      HBV viral load and high HBeAg seroconversion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, prospective studies have shown that LDT can improve the estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (EGFR).Therefore, this study aims to explore the clinical study of LDT&#xD;
      combined with TDF and TAF in patients treated with tenofovir and EGFR &lt; 90ml / min / 1.72m².&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, open-label clinical study. This study was aimed to explore the LDT&#xD;
      combined with TDF and TAF in patients treated with TDF and EGFR &lt; 90ml / min / 1.72m².The&#xD;
      primary objectives of this study is as follows: To access the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      12-month treatment with LDT combined with TDF and only TAF in patients with CHC and cirrhosis&#xD;
      in real-world clinical practice in Southern area of China. The proportion of participants&#xD;
      with HBV DNA (DNA:Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid)was evaluated. This study aims to&#xD;
      enroll 200 patients with CHB in each treatment group. Patients with CHB having received the&#xD;
      TAF previously but EGFR &lt; 90ml / min / 1.72m² subsequently fulfills the indication of&#xD;
      antiviral therapy will be administered with LDT combined with TDF and only TAF treatment.&#xD;
      After 12-month treatment, all the patients will be followed up for 12 months.&#xD;
