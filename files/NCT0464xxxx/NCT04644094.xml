      Hypothesis/Study question&#xD;
&#xD;
      In infants born at less than 29 weeks of estimated gestational age, what are the effects of&#xD;
      dexamethasone use on cardiac structure/performance and lung water content?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure effects before and after dexamethasone administration on cardiac&#xD;
      structure/performance will be evaluated by using the M-mode technique (Devereux method&#xD;
      (25-27) and lung water content will be specifically determined by the degree of water&#xD;
      retention in premature lungs assessed by lung ultrasound at the pre specified time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology / Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single center, prospective observational cohort study planning to enroll eligible patients&#xD;
      over a period of 12 months&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of dexamethasone on cardiac structure/performance and&#xD;
      lung water content in the extremely preterm population undergoing treatment for significant&#xD;
      lung disease. For that, the specific aims are to determine the occurrence, evolution over&#xD;
      time and possible hemodynamic impact of left ventricular hypertrophy and occurrence and&#xD;
      degree of water retention in premature lungs, after dexamethasone administration. As&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, this study also investigates the effects of dexamethasone on the ductus&#xD;
      arteriosus, body growth, and autonomic regulation heart rate variability, as well as other&#xD;
      important outcomes outlined in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesize that in some infants dexamethasone will be associated with the&#xD;
      occurrence of early and/or prolonged left ventricular hypertrophy, which may be associated&#xD;
      with changes in cardiac performance. It also hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory effects&#xD;
      of dexamethasone would improve inflammation of immature lungs, leading to a decrease in&#xD;
      interstitial fluid.&#xD;
