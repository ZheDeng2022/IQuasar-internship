  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies (including ASPEN/ESPEN) have demonstrated that balanced diet formula rich in&#xD;
      omega 3 fatty acids (ω-3 FA), fibers, protein as well as mineral, vitamins (trace elements)&#xD;
      are essential for cancer patients to improve health status and tolerability of chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Hence, the present multi-centered, randomized clinical trial was framed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of ready to use balanced nutritional formula-PCNF (rich in ω-3 FA, fibers, MTC,&#xD;
      BCAA, and micro-nutrients), in various cancer patient by checking calorie intake and overall&#xD;
      health status through assessing various anthropometric and biochemical parameters especially&#xD;
      total proteins, pre-albumin, and transferrin.&#xD;

      Many studies (including ASPEN/ESPEN) have demonstrated that balanced diet formula rich in&#xD;
      omega 3 fatty acids (ω-3 FA), fibers, protein as well as mineral, vitamins (trace elements)&#xD;
      are essential for cancer patients to improve health status and tolerability of chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Hence, oncologic nutritionist strongly recommends cancer patients (with cachexia) to consume&#xD;
      a diet rich in protein and dietary fibers along with balanced essential micronutrients like&#xD;
      vitamins and minerals (Van Norren et al., 2009; Yeh et al., 2013). From the above statement,&#xD;
      it cleared that nutritional support is a crucial aspect of multi-modal cancer care, by&#xD;
      improving the overall health status by suppressing various adverse events as well as enhance&#xD;
      treatment regimen for a speedy recovery. Hence, the present multi-centered, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial was framed to evaluate the efficacy of ready to use balanced nutritional&#xD;
      formula-PCNF (rich in ω-3 FA, fibers, MTC, BCAA, and micro-nutrients), in various cancer&#xD;
      patient by checking calorie intake and overall health status through assessing various&#xD;
      anthropometric and biochemical parameters especially total proteins, pre-albumin, and&#xD;
      transferrin.&#xD;
