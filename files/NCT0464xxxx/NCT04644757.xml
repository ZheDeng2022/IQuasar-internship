    <description>The study will employ an individual receptive relaxation music method with participants selecting music based on their preference from a selection of various styles from the MUSIC CARE© app. The music intervention will last 20 minutes per session and will be administered twice daily for 4 consecutive days. Participants will be given an electronic tablet with the MUSIC CARE© app loaded on it and trained on how to access the app to select their preferred style of music.Participants will be instructed to use the provided headphone during all interventions and to sit in a quiet area while wearing an ocular mask to avoid distractions.The PI will remotely monitor each of the music intervention sessions in real-time monitoring via a secured video conferencing interface to ensure adherence to study protocol.</description>
