  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergies are associated with a decrease in quality of life. Patients with FPIES often&#xD;
      have more food avoidance than necessary. The greater the number of avoided foods, the greater&#xD;
      the risk of eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no study about quality of life or assessment of eating difficulties has been&#xD;
      performed in a French-speaking pediatric population with FPIES or celiac disease&#xD;

      1.1 Current state of knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
      IgE-mediated food allergies are allergies whose symptoms are urticaria, angioedema,&#xD;
      rhinoconjunctivitis, digestive signs, bronchospasm, or even anaphylaxis within 2 hours after&#xD;
      ingestion of food. The prevalence of these food allergies in children ranges from 1.6% to&#xD;
      5.6%. Patients with food allergy should follow a strict avoidance diet of the culprit food,&#xD;
      until tolerance get acquired in a few months or years later. The avoidance diet is set up by&#xD;
      the parents, and must be applied in all places where the child lives (family, nursery and&#xD;
      school). Careful reading of the labels and displays in collective restorations are essential&#xD;
      in order to limit accidental ingestion. For the most ubiquitous and / or risky foods, parents&#xD;
      often have to provide packed lunches. An IgE-mediated emergency kit is required, containing&#xD;
      an antihistamine, and sometimes a self-injectable epinephrine pen and bronchodilators. The&#xD;
      protocol in the event of an allergic reaction must be known by all caregivers for the child,&#xD;
      in order to react immediately if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome or FPIES is one of the non IgE-mediated forms of&#xD;
      food allergy. Incidence is estimated around 0.015-0.7% in infants and children. FPIES&#xD;
      symptoms are delayed: vomiting within 1 to 4 hours after ingestion of the offending food,&#xD;
      associated with other symptoms such as lethargy with pallor, diarrhea secondarily. Unlike&#xD;
      other non IgE-mediated allergies, FPIES is a potentially severe allergy, with hypovolemic&#xD;
      shock seen in 15-33% of cases with dehydration. The most frequently offending foods are&#xD;
      ubiquitous, such as milk, fish, eggs, rice and oats. The management of patients with FPIES&#xD;
      consists of the avoidance of the offending food(s) until that tolerance is acquired&#xD;
      spontaneously in a few months or years. A specific first aid kit is also prescribed, in order&#xD;
      to limit dehydration in the event of vomiting after an accident of ingestion, with at least&#xD;
      oral rehydration solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Celiac disease is a gluten-induced autoimmune enteropathy responsible for digestive&#xD;
      malabsorption. It affects 1.4% of the population in the world. The symptoms are very varied,&#xD;
      such as chronic diarrhea or chronic constipation resistant to laxative treatment, abdominal&#xD;
      distension, chronic fatigue, weight loss and growth retardation, nutritional deficiencies.&#xD;
      The treatment consists of a lifelong elimination of gluten only (strict for wheat, rye,&#xD;
      barley, and controlled for oats). To date, celiac disease is not curable, but the elimination&#xD;
      diet allows clinical, biological and histological normalization in the digestive mucosa.&#xD;
      Unlike FPIES or IgE-mediated allergies, the patient and their family do not have to fear a&#xD;
      severe reaction in case of accidental exposure, and no first aid kit is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Description of the population to be studied and justification of their choice&#xD;
&#xD;
      FPIES and IgE-mediated food allergies primarily affect young children. A limiting factor in&#xD;
      terms of age for this study is the fact that the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
      (FAQLQ) has not been translated into French for adolescents over 12 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population studied is therefore children under 12 years of age, with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      FPIES, IgE-mediated allergy or celiac disease. A control group is also planned to be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Description of the elements covered by the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Quality of Life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food allergies negatively impact the quality of life of patients and their families due to&#xD;
      prolonged and restrictive avoidance diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life of children with celiac disease does not differ from that of healthy&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our experience, parents of patients with FPIES often report fear of another impressive&#xD;
      allergic reaction, with profuse vomiting, and a child described as lethargic and pale during&#xD;
      the reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents sometimes prefer to delay entering the community in the face of fear of accidental&#xD;
      exposure to the culprit allergen, or the fear of a reaction with the introduction of new&#xD;
      food, especially if the child is already allergic to several groups of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life of families is more impaired in cases of FPIES than in cases of&#xD;
      IgE-mediated food allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During childhood, there are 2 ways to assess the quality of life: a) by measuring the quality&#xD;
      of life of the child himself, or b) by measuring the quality of life of the child according&#xD;
      to the perception of parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The generic PedsQLTM quality of life questionnaire was validated in English and in French to&#xD;
      assess children's quality of life, using a form to be completed by parents from birth and /&#xD;
      or by the child after the age of 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food allergy-specific quality of life questionnaires: FAQL-PB (Food Allergy Quality of&#xD;
      Life-Parental Burden) and FAQLQ-PF (Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire - Parent Form)&#xD;
      have been validated for IgE-mediated food allergies and in FPIES in parents of children aged&#xD;
      0 to 12 in an English version. There is also a French version of FAQLQ-PF and FAQLQ-CF (Food&#xD;
      Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire - Child Form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no quality of life study has been performed in a French-speaking pediatric&#xD;
      population with FPIES or celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eating disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food neophobia is physiological between the ages of 2 and 6, but becomes pathologic if it&#xD;
      persists beyond 6 years or if it is exacerbated between 2 and 6 years. It is defined by a&#xD;
      refusal to eat foods which are new or not known by the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the majority of patients with FPIES are allergic to only one food, children's diets&#xD;
      are often over-restricted to several food groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eating disorders affect 22 to 50% of children with FPIES. These are mainly food refusals,&#xD;
      swallowing or chewing difficulties, and sensory disturbance. The risk of food refusal is&#xD;
      increased in the event of multiple-food FPIES. In a cohort of 32 patients, only half of these&#xD;
      patients received a specialist opinion for the management of eating disorders, probably due&#xD;
      to default screening for these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French Child Food Rejection Scale (CFRS) score allows screening for food neophobia and&#xD;
      pickiness in children aged 2 to 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For older children (over 7 years old) and adults, there is the Food Neophobia Scale (FNS),&#xD;
      adapted in French (AFNS: Adapted Food Neophobia Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no study has evaluated eating disorders in a French-speaking pediatric population&#xD;
      with FPIES or celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Rationale for the duration of the study The research will last at least 2 years. The goal&#xD;
      is to include at least 100 patients with FPIES, 100 patients with IgE-mediated food allergy&#xD;
      other than FPIES, 100 patients with celiac disease and 100 control patients.&#xD;
