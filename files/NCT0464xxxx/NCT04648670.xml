      The aim of our research is to evaluate the effect of a cognitive stimulation program in older&#xD;
      adults aged 65 or over The intervention was carried out at the Foundation of Zaragoza&#xD;
      (Spain), consisting of 10 sessions of 45 minutes/week during 10 weeks.with normal cognition&#xD;
      and compare it, in the short, medium and long term, with the evolution of other people, with&#xD;
      the same characteristics and for which this intervention has not been carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significant increase in the number of people over 65 years of age in relation to the&#xD;
      total population suggests a significant increase in age-related pathologies. Prevention is&#xD;
      essential to avoid cognitive aging and preserve higher mental functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From an economic perspective, it is estimated that people with mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      produce 16% more spending than those with normal cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive stimulation is a low-cost non-pharmacological treatment that has shown its benefits&#xD;
      in the preservation of cognitive aspects based on the brain plasticity it generates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research is based on cognitive stimulation using the yellow and Orange Mental Activation&#xD;
      notebooks, levels that correspond to the scores of Lobo's cognitive Mini-test. The book&#xD;
      consists of 4 practical exercises that work on 10 cognitive aspects (memory, orientation,&#xD;
      language, praxis, gnosis, calculation, perception, reasoning, attention and programming); in&#xD;
      total 40 exercises. The models on which the laptop is based are the cognitive model and the&#xD;
      human occupation model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Health Center San José Norte-Centro of Zaragoza (Spain), assessments were made to 416&#xD;
      volunteer candidates, of which 215 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria;&#xD;
      being a total of 201participants that have been part of the randomized controlled trial. Of&#xD;
      the 201 participants; 101 have carried out the intervention as an intervention group and 100&#xD;
      as the control group. The control group did not perform any type of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention was carried out at the Foundation of Zaragoza (Spain), consisting of 10&#xD;
      sessions of 45 minutes/week during 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conceptual framework of this intervention is formed by the framework for practice of&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy, the cognitive model and the human occupation model of Gary Kielhofner .&#xD;
&#xD;
      To homogenize both the assessments and the intervention, a standardized training was carried&#xD;
      out for the occupational therapists who carried them out and consisted of a theoretical part&#xD;
      and a practical part of 10 hours each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study began in December 2011, obtained the authorization of the Directorate of Primary&#xD;
      Care of the Zaragoza II Sector and the approval of the project by the Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Government of Aragón (CEICA). This study has followed the ethical standards&#xD;
      recognized by the Declaration of Helsinki. The initial assessments began this month. The&#xD;
      necessary sample size was reached in October 2012 and, from that moment on, randomization and&#xD;
      intervention with the selected participants was carried out. Three other assessments were&#xD;
      made, both for the intervention group and for the control group, immediately after the&#xD;
      intervention, six months and one year after the intervention.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline and change in 1 week, 6 months, baseline and 12 moths</time_frame>
    <description>It is a reliable and used instrument for the evaluation of cognitive impairment. It meets criteria of &quot;feasibility&quot;, &quot;content validity&quot;, &quot;procedural&quot; and &quot;construction&quot;. Test-retest reliability: weighted kappa = 0.667, sensitivity = 89.8%, and specificity = 83.9%; with the cutoff point 23/24. A score of 28 is considered the lower limit of normal performance in adult population; scores equal or less than 27 would denote cognitive deficits.</description>

    <measure>Set Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and change in 1 week, 6 months, baseline and 12 moths</time_frame>
    <description>The set-test was first introduced by Isaacs in 1972, and proposed as an aid in the diagnosis of dementia in the elderly population by Isaacs and Kennie in 1973. It explores verbal fluency, category naming and semantic memory. The collection of information is through a hetero-administered questionnaire. Adapted and validated by Dr. Pascual. It measures the verbal fluency of a categorical type, by asking the subject to cite up to a maximum of ten responses from each of the following categories: colors, animals, fruits and city. There is extensive experience in the use of this scale in our country. It is an option in illiterate people, with sensory impairments or when the consultation time is a conditioning factor. It has a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 67%, with a misclassification rate of 24% .The cut-off point to detect dementia: -In adults: Equal to or less than 29 -In older than 65 years: Equal to or less than 27</description>

    <measure>The Barthel Index (Barthel)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and change in 1 week, 6 months, baseline and 12 moths</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by Mahoney &amp; Barthel (1965), assesses the level of independence in ten Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADLs) and is an indicator of skills for people with reduced mobility. Its internal consistency is 0.89-0.92; obtains intra- observer reliability with kappa indexes between 0.47 to 1.0. Values the ability to perform ten BADLs: feeding, bathing, dressing, grooming, bowel control, bladder control, toilet use, transfers chair-bed, mobility and stairs use. A score is assigned to each item (0, 5, 10, 15) as a function of time and help needed. The final score varies from 0 (completely dependent) to 100 (completely independent). Above 60 points there is a high probability of continuing to live in the community.</description>

    <description>Assesses the degree of autonomy in eight Instrumental Activity Daily Livings (IADLs) necessary for living independently in the community. Its reliability is = 0.85 sensitivity = 0.57 and specificity = 0.92. In a study in Spanish population the internal consistency was 0.94; Regarding the convergent validity all the correlation coefficients were higher than 0.40. A summary score ranges from 0 (low function, dependent) to 8 (high function, independent) for women, and 0 through 5 for men (historically, for men, the areas of food preparation, housekeeping, laundering are excluded).</description>

    <measure>The Goldberg questionnaire (EADG)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and change in 1 week, 6 months, baseline and 12 moths</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluates the mood referred to anxiety and depression. The original questionnaire was developed by Goldberg and consisted of 18 items. Consists of two sub-scales, one of anxiety and other of depression. The last 5 questions of the EADG are only formulated if there are positive answers to the first 4 questions, which are obligatory. The higher the number, the more severe your depression is likely to be. Of all the cutoff points, the most suitable result for the sub-scale of anxiety is 4 points and for the sub-scale of depression is 2 point. The Spanish version of EADG has demonstrated its reliability and validity in the field of Primary Care; with a sensitivity of 83.1%, a specificity of 81.8%, a misclassified index of 17.7% and a positive predictive value of 95.3% .&#xD;
The investigators used the sub-scale of anxiety; its overall specificity = 91% and its sensitivity = 86%</description>

    <measure>The abbreviated Yesavage depression scale (GDS-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and change in 1 week, 6 months, baseline and 12 moths</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluates the mood referred to depression. The first version consisted of 30 items . Subsequently, abbreviated version (GDS-15) was published with 15 questions; for use in older people living in the community. For cut-off point 4/5 the sensitivity rates vary between 92.7% and 97.0%, the specificity between 54.8% and 65.2%; the positive predictive value between 69.6% and 82.6% and the negative between 83.3% and 94.4%.</description>
