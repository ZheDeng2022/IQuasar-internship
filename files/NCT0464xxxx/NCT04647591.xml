  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ear, nose and throat barotrauma are the most frequently encountered accidents during diving.&#xD;
      One study related to recreational diving reports that ENT barotrauma concern 10% of dives&#xD;
      with experimented divers and 30% with novice divers. Nevertheless, a low number of studies&#xD;
      were realized on ENT barotrauma, particularly those involving middle ear and sinuses, maybe&#xD;
      because most of them evolve favorably without sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, it has been described that pathologies which may induce chronic or acute tubal&#xD;
      dyspermeability can result in an increased middle ear or sinus barotrauma risk. But once&#xD;
      again no study was realized which objective was to look for an association between these risk&#xD;
      factors and for the association strength between risk factors and ENT barotrauma occurrence.&#xD;
      Few data on military population exist either. However, operational constraints, stressing&#xD;
      environment with necessity of realizing performances to validate diving certificate or other&#xD;
      military diving specificities can lead one to think that military divers have an increased&#xD;
      risk to be subjected to ENT barotrauma. Furthermore, therapeutic measures and more&#xD;
      particularly physicians' attitude concerning a temporary incapacity period to avoid&#xD;
      recurrence or clinical worsening of barotrauma differ depending on diving centers. But the&#xD;
      question to resume diving or not is essential for military staff given that temporary&#xD;
      incapacity may lead to training cessation or can be questioned because of operational&#xD;
      constraints requiring anticipated diving resumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to study middle ear and sinus barotrauma thanks to&#xD;
      questionnaires focused on those pathologies and their potential risk factors. The hypothesis&#xD;
      is that it will allow identification of main risk factors in order to develop preventive&#xD;
      measures as well as the characteristics and missions of concerned divers and the impact of&#xD;
      those barotrauma on this population.&#xD;

      Ear, nose and throat barotrauma are the most frequently encountered accidents during diving.&#xD;
      It has been described that pathologies which may induce chronic or acute tubal&#xD;
      dyspermeability can result in an increased middle ear or sinus barotrauma risk. But no study&#xD;
      was realized which objective was to look for an association between these risk factors and&#xD;
      for the association strength between risk factors and ENT barotrauma occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Futhermore, few data on military population exist while operational constraints, stressing&#xD;
      environment with necessity of realizing performances to validate diving certificate or other&#xD;
      military diving specificities can lead one to think that military divers have an increased&#xD;
      risk to be subjected to ENT barotrauma. Therapeutic measures and more particularly&#xD;
      physicians' attitude concerning a temporary incapacity period to avoid recurrence or clinical&#xD;
      worsening of barotrauma differ depending on diving centers. But the question to resume diving&#xD;
      or not is essential for military staff given that temporary incapacity may lead to training&#xD;
      cessation or can be questioned because of operational constraints requiring anticipated&#xD;
      diving resumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is then to study middle ear and sinus barotrauma in order to&#xD;
      identify main risk factors, the characteristics and missions of concerned military divers and&#xD;
      the impact of those pathologies on this population. Two kind of questionnaires will be used :&#xD;
      one which will be completed by divers just after their inclusion in the study and one that&#xD;
      will be filled in case of ENT barotrauma suspicion over a period of two years. The first&#xD;
      questionnaire will give information about diving level and medical history and the second one&#xD;
      will allow standardized assessment of barotrauma suspicion . Divers will be followed for two&#xD;
      years, whether they experience an ENT barotrauma or not.&#xD;
