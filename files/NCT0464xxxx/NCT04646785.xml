      Considering the limited availability of psychosocial interventions for IBD, this study aims&#xD;
      to investigate MBCT as an adjunctive treatment to treatment as usual to reduce psychological&#xD;
      stress and improve sleep quality/regularity in patients with IBD who report elevated stress&#xD;
      levels. The study will have a follow-up duration of 12 months from baseline.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract,&#xD;
      consisting of crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In The Netherlands, there are&#xD;
      about 90,000 IBD patients, mainly young adults who are in a turbulent part of their life with&#xD;
      starting a family and career. The prevalence of IBD seems to be rising. The peak incidence is&#xD;
      between 15 and 30 years. The disease is characterized by periods of disease activity (flares)&#xD;
      alternating with periods of (clinical) remission. Physical symptoms include abdominal pain,&#xD;
      diarrhea, rectal bleeding and fatigue. Although the arsenal of drugs has increased in recent&#xD;
      decades, there is no cure for the disease and patients are usually long-term treated with&#xD;
      different (immunosuppressive) medications. Nevertheless, at this moment, we are only&#xD;
      partially able to keep our IBD patients in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even in those in remission, IBD is associated with increased levels of psychological stress,&#xD;
      with estimated prevalence rates of 21% for depressive symptoms and 35% for anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
      In periods of disease activity, prevalence of elevated anxiety levels was even found to be as&#xD;
      high as 75.6%. Besides psychological stress, IBD patients in remission report lower quality&#xD;
      of life compared to the general population. This is due to the physical symptoms but also to&#xD;
      fatigue, worries, anxiety, depression, impaired satisfaction with social role and sleep&#xD;
      disturbances. More than 40 % of the IBD patients experience fatigue. This may contribute to&#xD;
      the higher sick leave days and higher work impairment rates in quiescent IBD, causing high&#xD;
      societal costs. In addition, poor sleep seems common in individuals with IBD and has been&#xD;
      linked to disease activity and shown as a predictor for subclinical inflammation and a risk&#xD;
      factor for relapse and poorer outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness training, typically in the form of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) or&#xD;
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), is a psychosocial group-based intervention that&#xD;
      has been shown to reduce psychological distress and improving quality of life, both in&#xD;
      patients with mental health problems and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes,&#xD;
      cancer, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia. Mindfulness training&#xD;
      focuses on the progressive acquisition of mindful awareness to better cope with negative&#xD;
      repetitive thoughts and feelings, and for that reason may be a good option to reduce&#xD;
      psychological stress and fatigue, and improve quality of life in patients with chronic&#xD;
      conditions including IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the available literature on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions for&#xD;
      IBD is still relatively scarce, a recent meta-analysis showed significant benefits in terms&#xD;
      of stress, depression, and quality of life. However, the variety in types of interventions&#xD;
      was rather high, and individual studies typically suffered from methodological limitations,&#xD;
      including small sample size, poor blinding of the outcome assessors, incomplete data&#xD;
      reporting and a relative lack of fidelity measures. Therefore, it seems warranted to conduct&#xD;
      a high-quality, multicenter randomized controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      MBCT to improve stress, sleep quality, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the limited availability of psychosocial interventions for IBD, this study aims&#xD;
      to investigate MBCT as an adjunctive treatment to TAU to reduce psychological stress in&#xD;
      patients with IBD who report elevated stress levels. In addition, we aim to improve sleep&#xD;
      quality/regularity and fatigue, IBD-related quality of life, perceived control over IBD,&#xD;
      clinical indicators (fecal calprotectin, c-reactive protein levels, Harvey Brashaw Index for&#xD;
      CD, Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index for UC), IBD-related flare. We also aim to improve&#xD;
      repetitive negative thinking, mindfulness skills, self-compassion skills, and positive mental&#xD;
      health. We will investigate whether improving sleep quality may be one of the pathways&#xD;
      through which mindfulness may help reduce psychological distress and improve quality of life&#xD;
      in IBD (working mechanism).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-armed randomized, multicenter, parallel group pragmatic trial comparing&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) vs. Treatment As Usual (TAU) for reducing&#xD;
      psychological distress in distressed patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post treatment (3 months) and follow-ups at 6, 9,&#xD;
      and 12 months. Objective sleep measures will be taken at baseline, post treatment and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive treatment as usual (TAU) according to Dutch and European IBD&#xD;
      treatment guidelines. The intervention group will receive Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy&#xD;
      (MBCT) in addition to TAU. The MBCT protocol that will be used is based on the protocol&#xD;
      published by Segal, Williams and Teasdale. MBCT consists of eight weekly 2.5h group sessions,&#xD;
      a six-hour silent day and daily home practice assignments guided by audio files. Mindfulness&#xD;
      is characterized by deliberate, non-judging and sustained moment-to-moment awareness. Health&#xD;
      related benefits include enhanced emotional processing and coping regarding the effects of&#xD;
      chronic illness and stress, improved self-efficacy and control, and a more accepting attitude&#xD;
      towards difficult emotions, thought and bodily sensations. Psycho-education and interactive&#xD;
      dialogue typically focus on stress management, balancing activities, lifestyle factors, and&#xD;
      strategies to stay well in the future (relapse prevention). Each group will be comprising&#xD;
      8-12 participants. MBCT courses will be taught on site by qualified mindfulness teachers.&#xD;
      Teacher competency will be assessed with the Mindfulness-Based Interventions - Teaching&#xD;
      Assessment Criteria, using a random selection of videotaped sessions, assessed by expert&#xD;
      teachers who have been trained to use these assessment criteria.&#xD;

In the short form, each scale consists of 2 items scored between 1 ((almost) never) to 7 ((almost) always) and subscale score ranges between 2 and 14. A higher score indicates a higher level of self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness, and lower scores of self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification. Total scores range from 12 to 84 (summed subscale scores), a higher score indicates a higher level of self-compassion.</description>
