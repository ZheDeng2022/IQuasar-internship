  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The function of injectable fillers for the treatment of dermal contour deformities is to&#xD;
      smooth dermal depressions formed by the loss of volume. These fillers (also known as soft&#xD;
      tissue augmentation devices) can restore the age-related volume loss of the face, balance the&#xD;
      disproportions or correct topographical anomalies. A previous study has already shown the&#xD;
      efficacy of Art Filler Volume on the midface, but this study was not comparative. It was thus&#xD;
      interesting to compare the efficacy of Art Filler Volume to a reference product but also to&#xD;
      test its efficacy on other areas including the temple, jaw-line and chin.&#xD;

      tissue augmentation devices) can restore the age-related volume loss of the face, balance the&#xD;
      disproportions or correct topographical anomalies. A previous study has already shown the&#xD;

      interesting to compare the efficacy of Art Filler Volume to a reference product but also to&#xD;
      test its efficacy on other areas including the temple, jaw-line and chin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, it is proposed to conduct, in post-CE marking, a randomized, prospective and&#xD;
      comparative study in order to document, an adequate aesthetic correction of the treated areas&#xD;
      as well as their immediate and long-term tolerance. This study aims to document the filling&#xD;
      capacity of Art Filler Volume, in relation to a product technically of the same order and&#xD;
      considered as a reference2,3,4,5 (this study will be comparative on temple / midface and&#xD;
      jawline but no on the chin were only Art Filler Volume will be injected). To do this,&#xD;
      subjects in whom a correction of mid-facial areas and / or temple and / or jaw-lines and / or&#xD;
      chin is sought, will be included. The aesthetic correction will be appreciated at 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed over 18 months. The persistence of the correction will be evaluated&#xD;
      at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No corrective injections with the products under study will be allowed. Each subject could be&#xD;
      injected for maximum 2 different zones.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>During the period of this clinical trial (18 months), only two products will be used for the aesthetic procedures (Art Filler Volume and Juvéderm Voluma).&#xD;
This prospective study will analyze 120 patients maximum who will receive dermal filler injections to the midface, temple, chin and jaw-line (cross-injection is authorized with maximum 2 zones per subject). The injections will be administered in a randomly assigned split-face design, except for the chin. One side of the subject's face will receive Art Filler Volume according to the randomization table, whereas the other side will receive Juvéderm Voluma injections in a blinded manner for the subjects (single blinded). The chin will only receive one injection of Art Filler Volume.</intervention_model_description>
