  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The function of injectable fillers for the treatment of dermal contour deformities is to&#xD;
      smooth dermal depressions formed by the loss of volume and the aging process. These fillers&#xD;
      (also known as soft tissue augmentation medical devices) can correct the skin&#xD;
      depressions/wrinkles, balance the disproportions or correct topographical anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, it is proposed to carry out in post-CE marking, an open, prospective and&#xD;
      non-comparative study in order to document an adequate aesthetic correction of the most&#xD;
      frequent areas treated with Art Filler Fine Lines, Art Filler Universal and Art Filler Lips&#xD;
      as well as their immediate and long-term tolerance.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Intradermal injection (superficial dermis for Art Filler Fine Lines / moderately deep to deep dermis for Art Filler Universal and Art Filler Lips). To this end, subjects in whom a correction of at least one of the studied zones is sought, will be included. The aesthetic correction will be appreciated at 3 weeks. Subjects will be followed over 18 months. The persistence of the correction will be evaluated at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months.&#xD;

Art Filler Fine Lines&#xD;
Forehead wrinkles&#xD;
