      The current trial will test the combination of darolutamide with SBRT, in oligometastatic&#xD;
      recurrent hormone sensitive prostate cancer. We hypothesize that the addition of short-term&#xD;
      darolutamide improves metastasis-free survival when added to SBRT without a detrimental&#xD;
      impact on the QoL. Considering the large reluctance of both patients and physicians to be&#xD;
      randomized to observation, we propose to use the historical data from previous reported&#xD;
      randomized trials (STOMP and ORIOLE) as a comparator to explore as a secondary endpoint.&#xD;

      As of the 2018 EAU guidelines, PSMA PET-CT is now recommended for prostate cancer patients&#xD;
      with a rising PSA following local therapy, resulting in an increase in patients with&#xD;
      conventional imaging M0, but novel imaging M1-state. This creates a new class of patients for&#xD;
      which no clear guidelines exist on the optimal management. It became clear that there is no&#xD;
      real consensus nor data on how these patients should be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1995, a new approach was proposed, hypothesizing that patients with a limited number of&#xD;
      metastases (oligometastases) might benefit from eradication of metastases by means of local&#xD;
      therapy, or metastasis-directed therapy. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), a novel&#xD;
      radiotherapy technique for metastatic and primary prostate cancer treatments, has emerged as&#xD;
      a highly precise radiotherapy method able to eradicate small metastases with acceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Nevertheless, responses following SBRT were not always durable. To improve response&#xD;
      rates and time to new metastases, additional steps should be taken balancing with potential&#xD;
      added toxicity. One of the logical steps would be to combine SBRT with temporary androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT) as this combination therapy is standard of care for primary PCa and&#xD;
      locally recurrent PCa17. However, ADT, negatively impacts quality of life (QoL) even when&#xD;
      used temporary. Anti-androgen or androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors (ARpI) may&#xD;
      circumvent these side effects by suppressing AR transcription by competitive inhibition of&#xD;
      AR, without lowering systemic testosterone. The current trial will test the combination of&#xD;
      darolutamide with SBRT, in oligometastatic recurrent hormone sensitive prostate cancer. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the addition of short-term darolutamide improves metastasis-free survival&#xD;
      when added to SBRT without a detrimental impact on the QoL.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically proven initial diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biochemical relapse of PCa following radical local prostate treatment (radical&#xD;
             prostatectomy (RP), primary radiotherapy or the combination of RP and prostate bed&#xD;
             adjuvant/ salvage radiotherapy) according to the EAU guidelines 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Following RP, patients with a biochemical relapse are eligible in case a metastatic&#xD;
             relapse is detected even in the absence of prior postoperative prostate bed&#xD;
             radiotherapy (adjuvant or salvage). In the absence of prior prostate bed radiotherapy,&#xD;
             prostate bed radiotherapy is mandatory for all pT3a or higher or patients with a&#xD;
             positive margin at time of RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients without prior RP that have a suspected local recurrence following primary&#xD;
             radiotherapy, a biopsy should confirm local recurrence. Patients with a confirmed&#xD;
             local recurrence and metastases are eligible in case they also undergo a local salvage&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic relapse on PSMA PET-CT with a maximum of 5 metastases (any M1a, M1b or&#xD;
             M1c). Concomitant diagnosis of N1 disease is allowed as long as all lesions are&#xD;
             treated with SBRT and the total number of lesions does not exceed 5. PSMA positive&#xD;
             lesions will be scored using the MI-RADS scoring system with lesions scored 4 or 5&#xD;
             considered positive19.&#xD;

             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those&#xD;
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before patient registration/randomization, written informed consent must be given in&#xD;
             accordance with to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations.&#xD;

             LHRH-antagonist, anti-androgen or estrogen) within the past 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spinal cord compression or impending spinal cord compression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastases in previously irradiated areas precluding safe delivery of SBRT&#xD;

&#xD;
