  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aim to determine kinetic of post treatment recovery/variation of a panel of innate&#xD;
      and adaptative immune system cells and molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results should allow to determine the optimal post treatment immunomonitoring timing and&#xD;
      panel to be used for future studies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a complexe interaction between tumor cells ans host immunity. Immunity system (IS)&#xD;
      is clearly involved in cancer developement control, and it is suggested that it could&#xD;
      participate to the response to anti cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is however no validated immunomonitoring strategy to allow a reliable patient's immune&#xD;
      status along time, and particularly after treatment.There are scarce existing information on&#xD;
      immunologic reconstitution profile recovery after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aim to perform immunomonitoring in young patients with cancer to describe kinetic&#xD;
      of recovery/variation of a panel of innate and adaptative immune system cells and molecules,&#xD;
      selected by their potential relevance according to literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concerned population are young women (˂40 yo) with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 patients cohorts A or &quot;End of treatment&quot; : patients recruited at the end of&#xD;
      treatment (study cohort) B or &quot;Diagnosis&quot; : Patients recruited at diagnosis (reference&#xD;
      values)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should contribute to give sufficient data to determine the pertinent timing and&#xD;
      cells/molecules panel to evaluate immunity profiling after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results could be used for further studies.&#xD;

    <description>Analysis of immune profile implies to evaluate changes of about 30 distinct immune cell (sub)types with their activation markers. These analyses are conducted at 3 time points for cohort &quot;A or End of treatment&quot; (1, 5, 9 months) and once for cohort &quot;B or Diagnosis&quot; before treatment start :&#xD;
-% and counts of immune cell populations (B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, dendritic cells)&#xD;
activation levels of cell subpopulations&#xD;
Secretion of cytokines after activation&#xD;
Determination of cytokines and chemokines after activation (picograms/ml) Description of the evolution of the parameters measured for cohort &quot;A or End of treatment&quot; with comparison to normal values (data from the EFS cohort and from cohort &quot;B or Diagnosis&quot;) Analysis of the reconstitution kinetic should allow us to determine wich biological parameters (immune cell (sub)types and their activation markers) will be most relevant to study immune profile reconstitution for further studies.</description>

8 patients will be recruited at diagnosis: a immune profile analysis will be performed before the start of treatment. This will give comparative values for the immune system cells and molecules.</description>
