      Our primary objective is to understand the impact of our quality improvement objectives on&#xD;
      pressure injury and wound care outcomes. We will follow patients admitted to our facility who&#xD;
      receive the standard of care for a up to a year. Patients to be followed will fall into one&#xD;
      of four groups: acute wounds, chronic wounds, pressure injuries present at time of admission&#xD;
      and at risk for pressure injuries.&#xD;

      Overall Objective The main objective is to understand the impact of an evidence-based best&#xD;
      practice model for wounds and pressure injuries that follows a patient through the continuum&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims The specific aim is to measure the rates of healing using tissue analytics and&#xD;
      the rates of pressure injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim measured is patients understanding of their health and the impact on their&#xD;
      wound healing, prevention of wound re-opening and pressure injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once we identify the rates we can translate the impact of rates into healthcare dollars and&#xD;
      begin to understand the fiscal impact of evidence based practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade researchers published the benefit of advanced wound care and the need to&#xD;
      implement pressure injury prevention. To date there is very little literature connecting the&#xD;
      acute care and post-acute care as a continuum by following a patient. Little is known about&#xD;
      what the outcomes for wound care and pressure injury would be if a patient were followed&#xD;
      through the trajectory of care. The medical home model suggests that placing the patient at&#xD;
      the center of care is the best practice for best outcomes. However, at times in the hustle of&#xD;
      the healthcare system the patient is lost. Implementing evidence-based best practice that&#xD;
      follows the patient through the continuum of care is one approach to keeping the patient at&#xD;
      the center of care. Currently wound care and pressure injury care or prevention is practiced&#xD;
      in silos between acute-care and post-acute care. There is little literature that links the&#xD;
      impact of continuing care throughout the continuum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Overview This quantitative study will utilize both primary and&#xD;
      secondary data. The secondary data source will come from chart review and be the comparison&#xD;
      group for outcomes. Patients will be enrolled upon admission as they are identified as&#xD;
      meeting criteria, which includes either having a chronic wound that is not followed by a&#xD;
      vascular team or an acute wound or a pressure injury. The fourth group of individuals to be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study are those patients who are immobile and are expected to remain&#xD;
      immobile at the time of discharge. Patients will be identified by admitting clinical staff&#xD;
      and then enrolled and consented by the study coordinator or principal investigator. Once&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, patients will have evidence based best practice interventions&#xD;
      implemented based on their needs while in the acute care setting. For patients with wounds&#xD;
      this will include that their cover dressing will be an antimicrobial foam bordered dressing&#xD;
      that minimizes dressing changes. For immobile patients they will have the evidence based best&#xD;
      practice pressure injury prevention bundle implemented. During the acute care admission, the&#xD;
      patient will receive education regarding their wound care and or pressure injury prevention.&#xD;
      Once the target post-admission site is identified, education for the caregiver at the&#xD;
      receiving site will be provided. The patient will continue to be followed in the post-acute&#xD;
      setting until the wound is healed or six months has passed on a weekly basis for a maximum of&#xD;
      time frame of one year. The wounds will be measured weekly using tissue analytics.&#xD;
      Re-education and coaching will be provided to the post-acute care facility. As patients are&#xD;
      discharged from the study, they will be asked to complete an evaluation survey of their&#xD;
      satisfaction with the care and the impact on their lives. The caregivers in the post-acute&#xD;
      care will be asked to complete a survey to evaluate the education and support provided.&#xD;
