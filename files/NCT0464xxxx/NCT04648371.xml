  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focusing on seniors with mental health conditions who are living in the community, this&#xD;
      initiative proposes to assess the acute and long-term effects of an 8-week course of daily (5&#xD;
      days/week) cognitive remediation (CR) training among 270 participants living in five LOFT&#xD;
      senior housing units. The acute course of CR will be followed by monthly one-week boosters&#xD;
      until the end of this 5-year study, totaling approximately 24-60 months of follow-up. This&#xD;
      trial will also be used as a platform to explore the ability to use transcranial direct&#xD;
      current stimulation (tDCS) to optimize response to CR by participant randomization to active&#xD;
      versus sham tDCS. Our ultimate goal is to improve the lives of seniors experiencing mental&#xD;
      illness and shape a future where they can live independently.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project requires the complete assessment and treatment of 270 older adult participants&#xD;
      living in LOFT senior housing. We will recruit individuals, age 50 or older, who meet&#xD;
      criteria for any DSM-V diagnosis, and are living at a LOFT residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrolment into the study, participants will undergo baseline assessments consisting&#xD;
      of clinical, neuropsychological (NP) and functional assessments. Once enrolled, each&#xD;
      participant will be randomized to receive transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS&#xD;
      (active or sham) concurrent with Cognitive Remediation (CR) for 8 weeks, 5 days per week,&#xD;
      followed by 3-5 day of booster sessions on a monthly basis until the end of the study.&#xD;
      Trained study staff Personal Support Workers will be administering CR and tDCS for the 8-week&#xD;
      intervention phase and the monthly boosters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo NP and functional assessments at the end of the 8-week induction&#xD;
      period, and then on an annual basis until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether active-tDCS + CR will result in better cognition (1a), lower fall rates&#xD;
      (1b), better function (1c), and less transitions to LTCHs from LOFT (1d) compared to&#xD;
      sham-tDCS + CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: Participants randomized to active-tDCS + CR will demonstrate better cognition&#xD;
      by the end of the 24-60 month follow-up period compared to those randomized to sham-tDCS +&#xD;
      CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: Participants randomized to active-tDCS + CR will demonstrate lower falls rates&#xD;
      by the end of the 24-60 month follow-up period compared to those randomized to sham-tDCS +&#xD;
      CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1c: Participants randomized to active-tDCS + CR will demonstrate better self&#xD;
      function by the end of the 24-60 month follow-up period compared to those randomized to&#xD;
      sham-tDCS + CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1d: Participants randomized to active-tDCS + CR will demonstrate less transitions&#xD;
      to Long Term Care Homes by the end of the 24-60 month follow-up period compared to those&#xD;
      randomized to sham-tDCS + CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To build the capacity of LOFT PSWs to deliver tDCS and CR independently and with good&#xD;
      fidelity to the intervention model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: At each LOFT location, local PSWs will be certified to deliver tDCS and CR&#xD;
      independently by the end of the first year of implementation of the study at each site.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Centrally administered, computer based generation scheme. Release of assignments only after consent and eligibility, and required baseline data collected. Inability to predict future assignments from past assignments. Creation of an audit trail for the assignment. Balanced Random Assignments to Treatment will be used to generate treatment assignment schedule in a random permuted block design. A file specifying the treatment allocation of each randomization ID will be stored with a member independent of the study. Then, the independent member will access the randomization ID and will access the treatment allocation and program tDCS. The randomization ID will be noted in the CRF but the allocation will not be accessed unless there is an SAE that requires breaking of the blind or the study is complete. In order to ensure that blinding has been maintained, participants and raters will be asked as each patient exits the trial to state what treatment they believe each participant was given.</masking_description>

    <description>Cognitive Remediation (CR) is a form of group psychosocial intervention that uses a hybrid approach of restorative and strategy based methods to improve areas of cognition (ie. attention, memory, processing speed and learning) through the use of computerized exercises. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS): tDCS will be administered for 30 min/day, at the begining of each group session. tDCS montage will be frontal with anode placed over Fz and the cathode over Iz. The direct current will be of 2 mA (current density = 0.57 A/m2). CR + tDCS is administered in groups consisting of 6-10 participants and one or two therapists. The groups meet 5 times per week for two hours per session over eight weeks, for a total of 40 sessions in induction phase. Afterwards 3 to 5 sessions per week on monthly boosters.</description>

    <description>CR is identical to the one described under the Active Comparator Arm. However, sham tDCS will consist of active stimulation for only 1 min/day, at the beginning of each group session. tDCS montage and the frequency of the sessions and the boosters will be the same as for the Active Arm.</description>

    <description>Cognitive Remediation (CR) is a well-established psychosocial group intervention that aims to improve neurocognitive abilities such as memory performance, executive functioning, processing speed, and attention.&#xD;
Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that can be safely administered to awake outpatients. It does not require general anesthesia or surgical implantation. It utilizes low intensity electrical current (e.g., 2 mA) either to increase cortical excitability with an anodal electrode or to suppress cortical excitability with a cathodal electrode.</description>
