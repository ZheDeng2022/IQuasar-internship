    <textblock>
      The investigators design a prospective clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      apatinib plus camrelizumab in pretreated patients with advanced biliary tract malignant&#xD;
      tumors and to analyze potential biomarkers of therapeutic response.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a non-randomized, single institutional, open-label, prospective trial designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in combination with camrelizumab for patients&#xD;
      with biliary tract malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 20 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in PUMCH and&#xD;
      treated with aptinib and camrelizumab. The investigators will follow up and collect subjects'&#xD;
      data each month to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including treatment related&#xD;
      adverse events, overall survival and time to progression and objective response. Multi-omics&#xD;
      data analysis will be used to find potential biomarkers of treatment response.&#xD;

    <description>Patients received apatinib orally at 250 mg once a day irrespective of the patient weight. During the treatment, apatinib can reduced to half of piece or once every other day considering the grade of treatment related adverse events. Camrelizumab 200 mg was administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. The intermittent period of camrelizumab was no longer than 6 weeks. All patients continued combination treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any reason.</description>
