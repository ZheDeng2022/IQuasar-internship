  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is caused primarily by smoking and smoking&#xD;
      cessation is the first-line treatment for slowing disease progression. Despite this, nearly&#xD;
      50% of COPD patients continue to smoke following diagnosis. Smokers with COPD report high&#xD;
      rates of co-occurring conditions - nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety - which serve&#xD;
      as barriers to quitting. The current study will pilot test a behavioral intervention designed&#xD;
      to target the common psychological factors underlying these co-occurring conditions and&#xD;
      foster smoking cessation among COPD patients.&#xD;

      rates of co-occurring conditions - nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety - which serve&#xD;

      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Examine effects of psychological risk factor reduction on smoking outcome. We will&#xD;
      conduct a pilot trial in which 62 participants are randomized to the multi-component&#xD;
      behavioral treatment (9 weekly sessions) or self-guided treatment (mailing of printed&#xD;
      self-help materials).The primary outcome is number of days abstinent for 2 weeks post-quit&#xD;
      (range = 0-14 days).&#xD;
