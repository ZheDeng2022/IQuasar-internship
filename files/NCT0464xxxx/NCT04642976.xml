  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite progress made in treating atrial fibrillation with catheter ablation, outcomes remain&#xD;
      suboptimal with pulmonary vein isolation alone. Ablation of ganglionated plexi (GP) has been&#xD;
      shown to be beneficial in patients with atrial fibrillation although optimal strategies of&#xD;
      localization of these regions have yet to be determined. The investigators aim to develop a&#xD;
      novel strategy of CT guided GP localization to guide ablation in patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation. The investigators also aim to clarify the network of innervation between GP to&#xD;
      clarify the optimal ablation strategy. This is an observational, single-center study&#xD;
      evaluating feasibility and efficacy of CT and high frequency stimulation (HFS) guided GP&#xD;
      mapping and ablation in patients with AF undergoing catheter ablation with pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation. Patients will undergo HFS and CT guided mapping of GPs followed by allocation into&#xD;
      one of 8 different GP ablation approaches in a non-randomized fashion.&#xD;
