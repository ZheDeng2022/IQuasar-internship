      To investigate the effects of Including 30-s sprints during low-intensity cycling exercises&#xD;
      during a training camp on performance and muscle/blood characterisitcs in elite cyclists&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inclusion of sprint intervals during low-intensity training (LIT) sessions has been suggested&#xD;
      as a potential mean to improve endurance performance in elite cyclists, facilitated by&#xD;
      muscular or systemic physiological adaptations. So far, the effects of such training has been&#xD;
      studied exclusively in context of short-lasting low-intensity sessions, representing a&#xD;
      scenario with suboptimal ecological validity for such highly trained athetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effects of including sprints during prolonged LIT-sessions&#xD;
      sessions during a 14-day training camp focusing on LIT, followed by 10 days recovery (REC),&#xD;
      on performance and performance-related measures in elite cyclists. During the training camp,&#xD;
      a sprint training group will conduct 12x30-s maximal sprints during five LIT sessions,&#xD;
      whereas a control group will perform distance-matched LIT-only. Overall, the training camp&#xD;
      will lead to substantial increases in training load compared to habitual training in both&#xD;
      intervention groups, followed by subsequent reductions during REC. Performance tests will be&#xD;
      conducted before the training camp (T0) and after REC (T2). Muscle biopsies, hematological&#xD;
      measures and stress/recovery questionnaires will be collected Pre (T0) and after the camp&#xD;
      (T1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was pre-registered at Norwegian Center for Research Data (14/08/2017, Norwegian):&#xD;
