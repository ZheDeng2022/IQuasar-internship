  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine if single fraction dose escalated palliative&#xD;
      radiotherapy results in a prolonged duration of benefit for patients otherwise suitable for&#xD;
      Multifraction (5-10#) palliative radiation. The primary endpointis to determine the&#xD;
      percentage of patients who have achieved a substantial benefit from palliative radiotherapy&#xD;
      and have not redeveloped symptoms by 12 months post treatment&#xD;

      One third of patients treated in the radiation oncology department are treated with&#xD;
      palliative intent. These patients are usually unwell due to their advanced disease and&#xD;
      suffering from pain and other symptoms related to bony and soft tissue metastases. Radiation&#xD;
      therapy (RT) has an important role in the symptomatic relief and improvement in the quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL) for these patients. A meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials (RCTs)&#xD;
      estimated the overall response rate (ORR) following RT for bone metastases at approximately&#xD;
      60% with up to one quarter of patients experiencing a complete response (CR). However,&#xD;
      palliative patients form a diverse group of patients and selecting the optimal number of&#xD;
      palliative treatments which provides an enduring benefit while not being burdensome for the&#xD;
      patient can be challenging. The ideal treatment is one that provides lasting symptom control&#xD;
      and involves the least number of treatments. Up to one quarter of patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer who undergo palliative RT will die within 1 month of the treatment, while up to 50% of&#xD;
      palliative patients will be alive at 12 months . In patients who receive a single fraction of&#xD;
      8Gy, up to 20% of these patients require retreatment to the same site, compared with 8% who&#xD;
      receive multiple fraction treatment . One potential option to increase the duration of local&#xD;
      control is with hypofractionated, dose escalated radiation.A phase II non-inferiority study&#xD;
      investigated this hypothesis in non-spine bone metastases, comparing a single treatment of&#xD;
      12Gy to 30Gy in 10 fractions. The cohort reported a higher pain response in the single&#xD;
      fraction dose escalated arm as early as 2 weeks post treatment (62 vs 32%), which was&#xD;
      maintained at 9 months (77% vs 46% respectively).&#xD;
