  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the concentration of birch pollen allergen (in ng/m3 of Bet v1) necessary to induce a conjunctival response in at least 50% of subjects allergic to birch.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>A positive conjunctival response is defined by an Abelson score ≥ 5.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the reproducibility of allergen exposure in the ALYATEC EEC</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>The reproducibility of the exposure will be assessed by measuring the quantity of birch pollen allergen (ng Bet v1) inducing a conjunctival response during step 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Study the effect of EEC birch pollen exposure on symptoms of rhino-conjunctivitis.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the exposure on the rhinoconjunctival response will be assessed by Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS).&#xD;
The RTSS is the sum of 6 rhinoconjunctivitis symptom scores: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, nasal congestion, ocular pruritus and watery eyes.&#xD;
Each symptom is graded in a 4-point scale as follows: 0: no symptoms, 1: mild symptoms, 2: moderate symptoms, 3: severe symptoms. It ranges from 0 to 18. The lower the score, the better the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Study the effect of EEC birch pollen exposure on symptoms of rhinitis</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the exposure on the rhinitis response will be assessed by rhinitis Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
The rhinitis VAS is a measurement of patient's subjective evaluation of symptoms severity. Patients will score the severity of their nasal symptoms on a scale, with 0 meaning no symptoms and 10 meaning the worst symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>4 hours exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the exposure on the conjunctival response will be assessed by Conjunctivitis Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
The conjunctivitis VAS is a measurement of patient's subjective evaluation of symptoms severity. Patients will score the severity of their ocular symptoms on a scale, with 0 meaning no symptoms and 10 meaning the worst symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure the amount of particles carrying the allergens.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of particles carrying the allergen will be measured with counters located in the exposure chamber.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Measure the aerodynamic diameter of the particles carrying the allergens.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>The aerodynamic diameter of the particles carrying the allergen will be measured with counters located in the exposure chamber.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate changes in mitochondrial respiration</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in mitochondrial respiration will be done by evaluating the modifications of the I to IV complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, before and after allergen exposure</description>

    <description>Step 1: dose validation 16 subjects are exposed for 2 consecutive days (D1 + D2), to the same aerial concentration of Bet v1.&#xD;
The main objective is achieved if the Abelson score is ≥ 5 on J1 or J2. If the main objective is achieved for the 60 ng/m3 concentration, 8 responder subjects will directly perform step 2.&#xD;
If the main objective is not achieved for the 60 ng/m3 concentration, the subjects will be exposed between 7 to 10 days after exposure 1, to an allergen concentration of 120 ng/m3 (Exposure 2: D1 + D2).&#xD;
Step 2: reproducibility Once the allergen concentration has been determined (step 1), 8 of the responder subjects from step 1 are exposed again to this same concentration, during 2 additional exposures (Exposure 3: D1 + D2 and Exposure 4: D1 + D2), at least 7 days apart.&#xD;
A wash-out period of at least 7 days is observed between step 1 and 2. The duration of allergen exposure will be a maximum of 4 hours for all exposures.</description>
