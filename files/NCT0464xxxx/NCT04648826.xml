  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About one-third to one-half of all people dying of extrathoracic malignant diseases have&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to the lungs. Surgery may help some people. But most people with&#xD;
      pulmonary metastases do not survive long. Researchers want to see if a combination of drugs&#xD;
      can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe dose of Azacytidine, when taken as a fine mist that is inhaled (aerosolized&#xD;
      Azacytidine), together with Bintrafusp Alfa to treat cancers that have spread to the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have cancer that has spread to the lungs, cannot be cured with&#xD;
      surgery, and has not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get Azacytidine by breathing treatments once a day for 3 days each week,&#xD;
      for 3 weeks. The 3-week period is 1 cycle. Each course of treatment is 3 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once per cycle, participants will get Bintrafusp Alfa via IV. An IV is a small tube that is&#xD;
      put into an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a diary of any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can take the study drugs for as long as they can continue treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have medical histories and physical exams. They will give blood, urine, and&#xD;
      lung lining fluid samples. Tumor samples will be taken via bronchoscopy. They will have lung&#xD;
      function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an imaging scan that shows how spray particles move in their airway&#xD;
      when they inhale. They will have tumor imaging scans of the chest and brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after they stop treatment....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While malignancies of diverse histologies express a variety of cancer-testis antigens (CTAs),&#xD;
      immune responses to these proteins appear uncommon in cancer patients due to low-level,&#xD;
      heterogeneous antigen expression, as well as local and systemic immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTAs such as NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A3 can be up-regulated in tumor cells of various histologies,&#xD;
      but not in normal cells, by DNA demethylating agents such as decitabine (DAC) and azacytidine&#xD;
      (AZA). Up-regulation of these CTAs facilitates CTL-mediated lysis of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials have demonstrated impressive regressions of tumors expressing NY-ESO-1&#xD;
      following adoptive immunotherapy targeting this CTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to shared CTAs, unique neoantigens are major targets for immune eradication of&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA demethylating agents not only up-regulate cancer-testis (CT) genes but also induce&#xD;
      expression of endogenous retroviruses (ERV) which further augments immunogenicity of cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, DNA demethylating agents enhance antigen processing and presentation by cancer&#xD;
      cells, and inhibit activity of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), thereby increasing&#xD;
      the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in murine tumor models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these provocative preclinical results, epigenetic priming for immune checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade has yet to be translated to humans due to systemic toxicities and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic limitations that prevent optimal dosing of DNA demethylating&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential strategy to enhance delivery of DNA demethylating agents to pulmonary&#xD;
      malignancies while minimizing systemic toxicities is to administer these drugs by inhalation&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies have demonstrated that aerosolized AZA mediates epigenetic activation of&#xD;
      gene expression in orthotopic lung cancers, and significantly prolongs survival of mice&#xD;
      bearing these tumors without systemic toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceivably, inhaled AZA may help to prime pulmonary malignancies for immune checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the optimal dose of inhaled AZA will be established in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable pulmonary metastases who are receiving the dual immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor-TGF-Beta trap, Bintrafusp alfa (M7824).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is intended to establish the rationale for further evaluation of inhalational&#xD;
      epigenetic priming regimens in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors or adoptive cell&#xD;
      transfer regimens in patients with locally advanced pulmonary malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I component: To determine pharmacokinetics, toxicities, maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of aerosolized AZA in patients receiving Bintrafusp alfa&#xD;
      for unresectable pulmonary metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II component: To determine frequency of intrathoracic clinical responses in these&#xD;
      patients following administration of aerosolized AZA at the RP2D and Bintrafusp alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both components: To determine safety of aerosolized AZA and Bintrafusp alfa in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable pulmonary metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically or cytologically proven, unresectable pulmonary metastases from&#xD;
      sarcomas, melanomas, germ cell tumors, or epithelial malignancies (except lung or kidney&#xD;
      cancers) who have received first line standard of care treatment for their metastatic&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurable disease by RECIST&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible irrespective of intratumoral PD-L1 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with prior treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and DNA demethylating&#xD;
      agents may be eligible for study provided they did not experience serious immune adverse&#xD;
      events that required discontinuation of the drug, and more than three weeks have elapsed&#xD;
      since treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients greater than or equal to 18 years; ECOG performance status of 0-1 without evidence&#xD;
      of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease; adequate pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 60% predicted, FEV1/FVC ratio greater than or equal to 60%, and&#xD;
      adjusted DLCO greater than or equal to 60% predicted; pCO2 less than or equal to 45 mm Hg and&#xD;
      pO2 greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg on room air ABG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive aerosolized AZA on three consecutive days (i.e.; Days 1, 2, and 3, or&#xD;
      Days 3, 4, 5) of a 21-day cycle. Three cycles constitute one course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bintrafusp alfa will be administered at a fixed dose of 2400 mg. During Phase I, Bintrafusp&#xD;
      alfa will be administered on Day 13 (i.e., once every 3 weeks, one week after AZA) of each&#xD;
      cycle starting from Cycle 2 of Course 1 (i.e., no Bintrafusp alfa in the first cycle of&#xD;
      Course 1). During Phase II, Bintrafusp alfa will be administered the day after the last AZA&#xD;
      treatment, during Week 1 of each treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of AZA will be escalated during Phase I using a 3+3 design with no intrapatient dose&#xD;
      escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of AZA will be sequentially increased to maximize intra-tumoral DNMT1 depletion&#xD;
      while avoiding Grade 3 or greater pulmonary or systemic toxicities attributable to this agent&#xD;
      during the first cycle of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment evaluation will be three weeks +/- one week following completion of each course of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the RP2D of aerosolized AZA has been defined, that dose level will be expanded to a&#xD;
      total of 9 patients to determine response rates at the RP2D using a Simon two stage design&#xD;
      for Phase II trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 42 patients will be accrued to this trial.&#xD;

             Heart Association Classification Class greater than or equal to II), serious cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, clinically significant bleeding or clinically significant pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of pneumonitis (idiopathic or drug induced) unless cleared by pulmonary&#xD;
             consultants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Receipt of any organ transplantation, including allogeneic stem-cell transplantation,&#xD;
             except for transplants that do not require immunosuppression (e.g., corneal&#xD;
             transplant, hair transplant).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Active Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome&#xD;
             (AIDS)-related illness due to unknown effects of AZA on systemic immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Other active infection requiring systemic therapy, including COVID-19 (testing will be&#xD;
             required as part of screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZA and Bintrafusp alfa may have&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with Bintrafusp alfa and AZA, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with Bintrafusp alfa and AZA.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Other severe acute or chronic medical condition or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or&#xD;
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Recent major bleeding events considered by the Investigator as high risk for&#xD;
             investigational drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory&#xD;
             agent with the exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diabetes type I, vitiligo, alopecia, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid disease not&#xD;
                  requiring immunosuppressive treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects requiring hormone replacement with corticosteroids are eligible if the&#xD;
                  steroids are administered only for the purpose of hormonal replacement and at&#xD;
                  doses less than or equal to 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Administration of steroids for other conditions through a route known to result&#xD;
                  in a minimal systemic exposure (topical, intranasal, intro-ocular, or&#xD;
                  intra-articular).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patients receiving another investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. An additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Administration of live vaccines with 30 days prior to enrollment. Administration of&#xD;
             inactivated vaccines (e.g., inactivated influenza vaccines) is permitted during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subjects unwilling to accept blood products as medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Emotional, psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements and safety of the trial.&#xD;
