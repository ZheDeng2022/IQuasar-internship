  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test an empirically supported psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      intervention, Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM). Researchers hope to better&#xD;
      understand the potential benefits of this intervention on brain tumor patients' mood and&#xD;
      quality of life. This may lead to improvements in doctor's understanding of how to enhance&#xD;
      brain tumor patient's wellbeing and overall functioning.&#xD;

      In this study, participants will be asked to do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete ~15-minute online surveys before the program, immediately after the program (4&#xD;
           months), and at follow-up (6 months). . Questions will ask about mood, anxiety, death&#xD;
           distress, quality of social relationships, and satisfaction with life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Meet with an interventionist six times (biweekly) for individual sessions via Zoom,&#xD;
           lasting 50-60 minutes each. Sessions will be audio-recorded to ensure all participants&#xD;
           receive the same information. Participants will be asked to only use first names.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complete weekly ~5 minute online surveys after each session on satisfaction with the&#xD;
           program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Complete an exit interview by telephone approximately 1 month after the 6-session&#xD;
           intervention. This exit interview will last approximately 15-30 minutes.&#xD;
