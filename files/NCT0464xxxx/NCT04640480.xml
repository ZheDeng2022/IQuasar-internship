  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SNB-101 is a novel nano-particle formulation of SN-38, the active metabolite of&#xD;
      irinotecan(CPT-11). Study SNB101P01 is a multicenter, open-label, dose escalation, phase 1&#xD;
      study of SNB 101 with its active ingredient SN-38, in participants with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. Dose escalation will occur using a modified accelerated titration design (ATD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive SNB 101 in different cohorts. SNB 101 will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously to participants on day 1 and day 15 of each 28 day treatment cycle until&#xD;
      progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Safety Review Committee will determine dose escalation, de-escalation, and modification and&#xD;
      the MTD/RP2D based on DLTs and other safety information.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participant will undergo a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed until death, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period, participants will receive SNB-101 (dose range: 5 mg/m2 to 50&#xD;
      mg/m2) intravenously on day 1 and day 15 of each 28 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose reductions are permitted after the DLT observation period, which occurs during the first&#xD;
      28 days of treatment (cycle 1). Participants may permanently or temporarily (at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion) discontinue SNB-101. If a participant experiences a DLT or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, SNB-101 treatment should be interrupted until the observed toxicity&#xD;
      returns to baseline or ≤ grade 1 toxicity. The start of the next cycle can be delayed up to 2&#xD;
      weeks at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
