  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see if the drug ruxolitinib is effective in reducing the&#xD;
      symptoms caused by low-risk essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - This research study involves the study drug Ruxolitinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, two-stage phase II clinical trial evaluating&#xD;
      ruxolitinib in low-risk but symptomatic essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera&#xD;
      (PV) patients. This research is being done to see if Ruxolitinib is effective in reducing the&#xD;
      symptoms people with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) are&#xD;
      experiencing. Ruxolitinib is a type of drug that blocks the specific proteins that may be&#xD;
      causing the symptoms people with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV are&#xD;
      experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Participants will receive Ruxolitinib for approximately 6 months and if benefitting from it&#xD;
      may continue to receive Ruxolitinib for as long as there is no unacceptable side effects or&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 60 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Ruxolitinib for polycythemia vera&#xD;
      (PV) but not for people with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incyte, a biopharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing funding&#xD;
      for the study, including the study drug.&#xD;

             age ≤ 60, and no JAK2 mutation), low (no history of thrombosis, age ≤ 60, presence of&#xD;
             JAK2 mutation), or intermediate risk (no history of thrombosis, age &gt;60, no JAK2&#xD;
             mutation) by IPSET criteria.1 Patients with polycythemia vera must be low risk (no&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with an MPN-SAF TSS score ≥ 10 AND at least one individual feature ≥ 5&#xD;
             documented on a separate visit within 3 months prior to study registration, as&#xD;
             documented in the clinical record or obtained by clinician. If not previously&#xD;
             documented in the electronic medical record, participants must be blinded to purpose&#xD;
             of MPN SAF TSS scoring for eligibility determination. Average daily MPN-SAF TSS score&#xD;
             must remain ≥10 with any individual feature ≥ 5 for the week-long baseline assessment&#xD;
             prior to ruxolitinib initiation .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously received or are receiving cytoreductive therapy (i.e.&#xD;
             hydroxyurea, anagrelide, interferon) are eligible for the study if therapy was used&#xD;
             for the indication of symptom control, in which case there will be a wash-out period&#xD;
             of one week from prior therapy discontinuation to ruxolitinib initiation. Patients who&#xD;
             temporarily required cytoreductive therapy for pre-operative control of blood counts&#xD;
             prior to surgery are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  values, no lower than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy not receiving treatment for&#xD;
             concurrent cancer diagnosis and/or prior concurrent malignancy within 5 years except&#xD;
             for basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV&#xD;
             viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants with evidence of chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             infection, they must be negative for HBV DNA, HCV RNA, or hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
             (BsAg) on suppressive therapy, if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Essential thrombocythemia patients who are high risk by IPSET-R criteria (age &gt; 60&#xD;
             with JAK2 V617F mutation and/or history of thrombosis).1 Polycythemia vera patients&#xD;
             who are high risk by NCCN guidelines (age &gt; 60 and/or history of thrombosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with &gt;5% blasts on baseline marrow exam or at any other time in peripheral&#xD;
             blood&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ruxolitinib or excipients of ruxolitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants requiring any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers&#xD;
             of 3A4 isozyme are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.&#xD;
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participant will be&#xD;
             counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the participant is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with inadequate liver or renal function at screening as evidenced by lab&#xD;
             values not meeting criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ruxolitinib is a Class C agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with ruxolitinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with ruxolitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of ruxolitinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. Pregnant women&#xD;
             and subjects of childbearing potential who are unwilling to take appropriate&#xD;
             precautions to avoid becoming pregnant or fathering a child are ineligible. Women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of ruxolitinib administration.&#xD;
