  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to look into the change of the corneal biomechanical properties in patients&#xD;
      undergoing insertion of the Ex-PRESS mini shunt or trabeculectomy for medically uncontrolled&#xD;
      glaucoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients in the study were divided into two groups. In group 1 the patients had the&#xD;
      Ex-PRESS mini shunt inserted in the operated eye and in group 2 the patients underwent&#xD;
      standard trabeculectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The corneal biomechanical properties were measured with the Ocular Response Analyzer before&#xD;
      surgery and at 1, 6 and 12 months after surgery. The corneal biomechanical properties&#xD;
      measured were the Corneal Hysteresis (CH) and the Corneal Resistance Factor (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change of the CH and CRF was compared in each group before and after surgery (at the&#xD;
      aforementioned predetermined time points) and between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraocular pressure was also measured with the Goldmann applanation tonometer at the&#xD;
      same time points and the change was compared before and after surgery in each group and&#xD;
      between the two groups.&#xD;
