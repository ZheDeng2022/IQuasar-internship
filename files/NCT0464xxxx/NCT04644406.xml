  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are five trastuzumab biosimilars approved by EMA (Ogivri® Mylan , Herzuma®&#xD;
      Biogaran, Ontruzant® MSD, Trazimera® Pfizer, and Kanjinti® Amgen) for the treatment of&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer. EMA's approvals were obtained on phase I pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      equivalence trials and phase III clinical trials based on efficacy primary endpoints in the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant setting and on Overall Response Rate in metastatic setting. Safety was a&#xD;
      secondary endpoints in these trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III pivotal trials compared trastuzumab biosimilars to Herceptin® in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting and in the metastatic setting. The trials were&#xD;
      designed before the approval of pertuzumab (in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings).&#xD;
      Thus, there is no available prospective data on the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab&#xD;
      biosimilars in combination with pertuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biosimilar compound can obtain an extrapolation of its indications to those of the&#xD;
      reference biological product since bio-similarity has been demonstrated (ie pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      equivalence and clinical studies in the most &quot;sensitive&quot; indications). To date, the use of&#xD;
      trastuzumab biosimilar in combination with pertuzumab is allowed, but this combination is not&#xD;
      supported by neither scientific evidence nor clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PETRA aims at evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of pertuzumab and a&#xD;
      trastuzumab biosimilar in real life.&#xD;
