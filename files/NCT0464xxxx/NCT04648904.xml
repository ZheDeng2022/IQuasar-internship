  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether providing radiation on a shortened (compressed)&#xD;
      schedule of 5 days in a row is a safe and effective approach to prevent cancer from coming&#xD;
      back in people who have had a mastectomy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female or male patients with invasive breast cancer who have had mastectomy and have a&#xD;
             chest wall reconstruction in progress or completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age â‰¥ 30 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Final AJCC Stage IIa - IIIa (pathologic stage T0N1a-2a, T1N1a-2a, T2N1a-2a, T3N0-2a,&#xD;
             all M0 status). Pathological stage for all patients not receiving neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy. Higher of the clinical or pathological T and N stage, if receiving&#xD;
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with pathological T1-2,N0 at the time of mastectomy&#xD;
             are only eligible if biopsy-proven clinically N1 or N2 disease is documented prior to&#xD;
             induction chemotherapy. Exceptions to these criteria (e.g. for T4 or N3 patients) are&#xD;
             possible after discussion with PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically negative tumor margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with distant metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy to the ipsilateral or contralateral breast or thorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with clinical, radiographic or pathological T4, N3 or involved internal&#xD;
             mammary disease (N1b, N1c, and N2b) will not be eligible to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical condition such as uncontrolled infection (including HIV), uncontrolled&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus, or connective tissue diseases (lupus, systemic sclerosis, or other&#xD;
             collagen vascular diseases) that, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make&#xD;
             this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancers. Patients are not considered to have &quot;currently active&quot; malignancies if they&#xD;
             have completed therapy and are considered by their physicians to be at &lt;5% risk of&#xD;
             relapse within 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant anti-neoplastic treatment is not allowed during protocol treatment and&#xD;
             should be completed at least 2 weeks prior to commencement of protocol treatment, with&#xD;
             resolution of associated acute toxicities. However endocrine therapies (tamoxifen or&#xD;
             aromatase inhibitors), anti-HER2 therapy and bisphosphonates are permitted without&#xD;
             restriction even during protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable to participate in all required study evaluations and procedures.&#xD;
             Unable to understand the purpose and risks of the study and to provide a signed and&#xD;
             dated informed consent form (ICF) and authorization to use protected health&#xD;
             information (in accordance with national and local patient privacy regulations).&#xD;
