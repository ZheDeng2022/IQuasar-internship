      Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) therapy has become a well-established treatment option&#xD;
      for endstage heart-failure either as a bridge to transplant (BTT) or destination therapy&#xD;
      (DT). Monitoring of the pump and with this the cardiac status with the HeartMate 3 (HM3) is&#xD;
      currently very limited to infrequent log-files with one data entry every 15 minutes and only&#xD;
      limited amount of entries. Due to the low resolution data, the standard HM3 monitoring is not&#xD;
      feasible for the evaluation of suction events or in depth analysis of the interaction between&#xD;
      LVAD and the remaining native heart function. Aim of this study is to develop noninvasive&#xD;
      diagnostics of the cardiac remaining respectively recovering function derived from HeartMate&#xD;
      3 pump data only and compare with standard clinical diagnostic procedures. These procedures&#xD;
      include cardiac ultrasound and ECG. After this pilot study, the newly developed methods would&#xD;
      allow frequent, simple and automatic monitoring of patients implanted with the HeartMate 3&#xD;
      device. Such continuous assessment of cardiac function would massively help therapy&#xD;
      optimization of cardiac protection and, if possible, cardiac recovery.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) therapy has become a well-established treatment&#xD;
           option for endstage heart-failure either as a bridge to transplant (BTT) or destination&#xD;
           therapy (DT). Currently, continuous flow LVADs are operated at a constant rotational&#xD;
           speed, which results in a fixed relation between the difference between pump inlet and&#xD;
           outlet pressure (=head pressure) and pump flowrate. This results in a cardiac support,&#xD;
           which is not very adaptable to physiologic demand or preload changes due to reduced&#xD;
           venous return and subsequent preload reduction e.g. due to hypovolemia. Nonetheless it&#xD;
           could be shown, that optimal setting of LVAD support is essential to optimize patient&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Proper measurement for cardiovascular function under LVAD support is therefore of key&#xD;
           importance, especially as unwanted pumping conditions such as &quot;overpumping&quot;, causing a&#xD;
           collapse of structures of the left ventricle (LV), also referred to as suction. This&#xD;
           could lead to suction induced arrhythmia (or tachycardia) as well as impairments to the&#xD;
           right ventricle (e.g. tricuspid valve insufficiency) due to a ventricular septum shift.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ultrasound and cardiac catheterization are the standard clinical methods for the&#xD;
           evaluation of morphological and functional properties of the heart, and also eventually&#xD;
           changing properties of the aortic valve. Further diagnostics include conventional ECG&#xD;
           analysis but also heart rate variability to obtain information of the neurohumoral&#xD;
           status. Exercise stress tests and recently developed activity diagnostics give further&#xD;
           important information about overall recovery and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All these methods however require time-consuming procedures, being unacceptably&#xD;
           cumbersome for frequent monitoring. On the other hand, a frequent and effective&#xD;
           noninvasive evaluation of the cardiac status provided by the rotary blood pump (RBP)&#xD;
           itself would have a remarkable impact on LVAD patients and their therapy, especially for&#xD;
           the evaluation of their overall and cardiac recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Previously, pump signals from another centrifugal blood flow device (HVAD Medtronic&#xD;
           Inc., Minneapolis, USA) have been used to estimate hemodynamic variables noninvasively.&#xD;
           These were used to track patient progress, or to detect unwanted pumping states, such as&#xD;
           ventricular suction. Variables such as contractility, relaxation, suction, Aortic Valve&#xD;
           Opening and cardiac rhythms, can be extracted. These may aid clinicians in their&#xD;
           decisions on the level and strategy of pump support. While this is not currently widely&#xD;
           implemented in clinical practice, this type of monitoring holds the promise of deeper&#xD;
           insights into patient physiology. As demonstrated in a recent study, continuous&#xD;
           high-resolution HVAD monitoring sheds light on suction occurrences. Interindividual and&#xD;
           intraindividual characteristics of longitudinal suction rates were observed. Longer&#xD;
           suction clusters have higher probabilities of tachycardia within the cluster and more&#xD;
           severe types of suction waveforms. This work showed the necessity of improved LVAD data&#xD;
           monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Abbott Inc. HeartMate 3 LVAD is a centrifugal continuous flow pump with a fully&#xD;
           magnetically levitated rotor enabling frictionless movement, textured blood-contacting&#xD;
           surfaces to establish a tissue interface with blood and wide blood flow gaps between the&#xD;
           rotor and its housing to lower shear stress and consequently blood trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Monitoring of the pump and with this the cardiac status with the HeartMate 3 is&#xD;
           currently very limited to infrequent log-files with one data entry every 15 minutes and&#xD;
           only limited amount of entries. Due to the low resolution data, the standard HM3&#xD;
           monitoring is not feasible for the evaluation of suction events or in depth analysis of&#xD;
           the interaction between LVAD and the remaining native heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim The aim of this study is to develop noninvasive diagnostics of the cardiac remaining&#xD;
           respectively recovering function derived from HeartMate 3 pump data only and compare&#xD;
           with standard clinical diagnostic procedures. These procedures include cardiac&#xD;
           ultrasound and ECG. After this pilot study, the newly developed methods would allow&#xD;
           frequent, simple and automatic monitoring of patients implanted with the HeartMate 3&#xD;
           device. Such continuous assessment of cardiac function would massively help therapy&#xD;
           optimization of cardiac protection and, if possible, cardiac recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study protocol The developed new methods are based on pump flow, pump motor and magnetic&#xD;
           levitation data only. These methods include also the evaluation of heart rate&#xD;
           variability and arrhythmias and its influence to HeartMate 3 suction events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this study non-invasive recordings of pump data will only be performed at rest, with&#xD;
           speed changes under guidance of echocardiography on occasion. Beat-to-beat/High&#xD;
           resolution pump data recordings for the HeartMate 3 have not been performed before, thus&#xD;
           the recorded pump data will be analyzed and compared to clinical diagnostics in this&#xD;
           pilot study. Previous feasibility and safety tests for the pump data recording have been&#xD;
           performed in the laboratory setting. The pump data recording is used for research only&#xD;
           as observational study and not for diagnostic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pickup of high resolution data is done with a coil mounted outside on the driveline&#xD;
           with only one contact (common ground) to the exposed metal housing of the driveline&#xD;
           connector. Therefore, the only metal connection will be this equipotential bonding&#xD;
           conductor connection to the outside of the metal housing of the driveline connector. The&#xD;
           pickup coil is only listening to the magnet field of the wires transferring data&#xD;
           packages between pump and peripheral controller. During the study there is no need to&#xD;
           exchange the existing peripheral LVAD HeartMate 3 controller, therefore at no point the&#xD;
           pump will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data of patients on the intensive care unit (ICU) or normal ward are stored in a&#xD;
           continuous data acquisition system (CDAS) on a notebook which is operated in battery&#xD;
           operation, and analyzed afterwards with a mat-lab (MathWorks Inc., USA) based software.&#xD;
           For outpatients a mobile data-recorder (size of approximately 8cm x 5cm x 2cm, weight&#xD;
           approx. 110g) powered with a 9V battery will allow a continuous data acquisition for a&#xD;
           period up to 2 months on a SD card.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Routinely, all pump parameters are stored in a so-called log file, in the form of&#xD;
           delimiter-separated character strings containing decimal and hexadecimal values. The log&#xD;
           file data is provided from the pump's controller and the pump itself, which are both&#xD;
           storing a periodical and an event log file. The periodical log files, as the name&#xD;
           implies, are created continuously and periodically during pump operation, while the&#xD;
           event log files provide additional information which is stored only when the HeartMate 3&#xD;
           detects a potential adverse event or abnormal pump behavior (e.g. arrhythmias, suction).&#xD;
           Therefore, the data of every patient is contained in multiple sets of four different log&#xD;
           files (periodical and event log files from the pump's controller, plus periodical and&#xD;
           event log files from the pump itself) with defined timestamps for each set of&#xD;
           parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The maximal storage capacity of logfiles is only 256 entries with a minimal periodic&#xD;
           logging interval of 10min. Therefore the ability to detect e.g. suction events and&#xD;
           abnormal pump operation due to hemodynamically changes should be evaluated with high&#xD;
           resolution continuous data acquisition system (CDAS) data and the routinely available&#xD;
           logfiles and compared to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pump data will be collected from the routinely available logfiles via the device monitor&#xD;
           and from high resolution HeartMate 3 CDAS data, which can be picked up contactless every&#xD;
           second.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data of patients on the ICU or normal ward are stored in a continuous data&#xD;
           acquisition system (CDAS) on a notebook which is operated in battery operation, and&#xD;
           analyzed afterwards with a mat-lab based software. For outpatients a mobile&#xD;
           data-recorder will allow a continuous data acquisition for a period up to 2 months on a&#xD;
           SD card.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the post-operative patient stay at the ICU and normal ward, the pump data will be&#xD;
           continuously recorded together with all routinely measured hemodynamic variables.&#xD;
           Contextually with the pump data, during the post-operative patient stay at the ICU and&#xD;
           normal ward, ECG will be continuously acquired from the clinical monitors. Holter ECG&#xD;
           data are recorded once for 24 hours during the normal ward stay and once at home after&#xD;
           the outpatient visit 12 months after enrollment. The application of the Holter ECG&#xD;
           device and the pump data measurement will be performed during the hospital stay or at&#xD;
           home thus requiring no additional patient waiting time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additionally, for patients with implanted pacemakers/ICDs or loop recorders, the heart&#xD;
           rate and variability parameters will be also retrieved from the data delivered by these&#xD;
           devices (of course, only if the setting of the pacemakers/ICD allows changes in the&#xD;
           patient individual heart rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
           ECG will be recorded using the clinical monitors during the stay on the ICU and using&#xD;
           Holter ECG devices for ambulant patients and in out of hospital patients. SPSS and&#xD;
           descriptive statistics will be applied. The standard heart rate variability parameters&#xD;
           and more sophisticated parameters for arrhythmia pattern detection which are derived&#xD;
           from the pump flow and the same parameters derived from the ECG signals or if applicable&#xD;
           and available from implanted pacemakers/ICDs and loop recorders will be described&#xD;
           explorative based on mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range) and&#xD;
           visually represented by histograms and box-plots. However, these only have a purely&#xD;
           exploratory character in this pilot study to check the feasibility and/or practicability&#xD;
           of this non-invasive methods and for a later, larger study to find possible&#xD;
           correlations, which should also be checked in a follow-up study. Following this pilot&#xD;
           study, a follow-up study should test the hypothesis that the developed methods for easy&#xD;
           assessment of cardiac function during LVAD support, can provide an additional tool for&#xD;
           optimization of cardiac protection, thereby reducing adverse events and optimizing&#xD;
           clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Summary Currently, studies of recovery of heart and body function are complex,&#xD;
           time-consuming and can only be carried out on a case-by-case basis. Aim of this study is&#xD;
           the continuous determination of cardiovascular parameters from the already non&#xD;
           invasively available pump data from fully magnetically supported cardiac support systems&#xD;
           (HeartMate 3, Abbott Inc.). In this project these analysis methods are to be applied&#xD;
           clinically and compared with established examinations (e.g. ultrasound, ECG). With the&#xD;
           newly developed biomedical method, a regular, high-resolution and cost-effective pump&#xD;
           monitoring, which further improves life expectancy and quality of life of LVAD patients&#xD;
           should be established.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients with the HeartMate 3 system implanted at the Medical University of Vienna,&#xD;
        which are able and willing to understand and sign the informed consent form, and which do&#xD;
        not meet any exclusion criteria will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: &lt;18 or &gt;75 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known intraventricular or aortic root thrombus formation or known&#xD;
             pathology of the coagulatory system. Although an intraventricular thrombus formation&#xD;
             is usually removed intraoperatively during the LVAD implantation procedure, the&#xD;
             rationale for this exclusion criterion is to avoid suction of such thrombus material&#xD;
             during possible speed changes (± 20% from the initial pump speed). Consequently, the&#xD;
             exclusion of patients with known pathology of the coagulation system, who thus have a&#xD;
             higher risk of developing any kind of thrombus formation, is another safety measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inaccessibility for transthoracic ultrasound diagnostics. Firstly, as described in the&#xD;
             visit and assessment schedule (Appendix), changes in pump speed are only performed&#xD;
             under transthoracic echo guidance. Secondly, as described above, echo parameters are&#xD;
             required to correlate with the non-invasive CDAS pump data. Therefore, the&#xD;
             inaccessibility of ultrasound diagnostics (e.g. due to poor image quality) is another&#xD;
             exclusion criterion.&#xD;
