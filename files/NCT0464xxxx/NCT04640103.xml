  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal cancer like Gastric cancer and colorectal cancer are high-incidence tumors&#xD;
      worldwide. Surgery is the only curable way. Perioperative treatment can improve the survival&#xD;
      of patients. Microsatellite instability-high（MSI-H）are a special subtype of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tumors, accounting for about 15-22%. According to current research, patients with this type&#xD;
      of gastrointestinal tumors cannot benefit from traditional perioperative chemotherapy, which&#xD;
      directly affects the long-term survival of patients. Because patients with MSI-H have a&#xD;
      unique tumor immune microenvironment, thus they are more likely to benefit from&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Current studies have confirmed that the use of immunotherapy during palliative&#xD;
      care can prolong the survival of patients with MSI-H. In the neoadjuvant treatment stage,&#xD;
      according to the previous clinical practice of our center, the use of immunotherapy can make&#xD;
      some patients achieve complete postoperative pathological remission. However, in the&#xD;
      perioperative treatment stage, the value of immunotherapy is still lack of powerful clinical&#xD;
      evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this, our group intends to start an observational study to prospectively enroll&#xD;
      patients with MSI-H gastrointestinal tumor using immunotherapy during the perioperative&#xD;
      period.The primary endpoint is safety while survival outcomes as secondary endpoints. In&#xD;
      order to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of immunotherapy during the perioperative&#xD;
      treatment stage in MSI-H gastrointestinal cancer&#xD;
