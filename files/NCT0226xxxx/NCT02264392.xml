    <textblock>
      Standard treatment for a soft tissue abscess involves incision over the area of maximum&#xD;
      fluctuance with drainage of purulence from the abscess cavity. The use of bedside ultrasound&#xD;
      to guide this drainage has the potential to improve treatment outcomes by ensuring complete&#xD;
      drainage of the cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the use of ultrasound for guidance of incision and drainage of soft&#xD;
      tissue abscesses will decrease treatment failure rate compared to standard blind incision and&#xD;
      drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis will be tested utilizing a blinded, randomized trial comparing standard&#xD;
      incision and drainage to ultrasound guided incision and drainage.&#xD;

      4) Background* The incidence of soft tissue infections is increasing, representing over 30&#xD;
      million emergency department visits per year. While there has been extensive research in&#xD;
      recent years surrounding the use of antibiotics for soft tissue abscesses, the surgical&#xD;
      management remains unchanged with standard therapy consisting of blind incision and drainage&#xD;
      of the abscess cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite incision and drainage and a spectrum of antibiotic coverage, treatment failure rates&#xD;
      for these infections range from 5-20%. It is possible that part of this treatment failure can&#xD;
      be attributed to inadequate abscess cavity evacuation. With blind drainage, it is possible&#xD;
      that residual purulence or unforeseen satellite abscess cavities contribute to the&#xD;
      persistence of the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound has been shown to aid in the identification of soft tissue abscesses and to help&#xD;
      differentiate cellulitis from an abscess. Over the last decade, clinician performed bedside&#xD;
      ultrasound has become a standard in the practice of emergency medicine with proficiency&#xD;
      requirements now in place for graduating emergency medicine residents. While many&#xD;
      practitioners have in fact adopted ultrasound in its use for the identification of abscesses,&#xD;
      few subsequently use the ultrasound for procedural guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are specifically interested in studying the use of ultrasound for identifying the ideal&#xD;
      location for initial incision as well as use of post procedural ultrasound to confirm&#xD;
      complete evacuation of abscess purulence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in this study will include patients presenting to the emergency department&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of soft tissue abscess. This includes patients of all ages and gender but&#xD;
      will exclude individuals who cannot give consent or are prisoners (as they cannot return for&#xD;
      follow up or be contacted for follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Soft tissue abscess suspected by patient history and physical exam and confirmed by&#xD;
           bedside ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Able to provide written consent/ assent&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incision and drainage to be performed by ED physician&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Peritonsillar abscess&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pilonidal cyst, genital or perirectal abscess&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-surgical wound infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Prisoners&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Previous incision and drainage for current abscess&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) Study-Wide Number of Subjects* N/A - Not a multi center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7) Study-Wide Recruitment Methods* Study subjects will be recruited from the patient&#xD;
      population of the emergency departments on the Memorial and University campuses of&#xD;
      UMASSMemorial Medical Center. Patients with signs and symptoms of soft tissue abscess&#xD;
      confirmed by bedside ultrasound will be identified and enrolled by treating physicians. This&#xD;
      will occur 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8) Study Timelines* A study subject's participation in the study will last for 1 week from&#xD;
      the time of enrollment. This will consist of the initial study visit (emergency department&#xD;
      encounter for treatment of the abscess), a follow-up visit at 2-3 days for wound evaluation&#xD;
      and wick removal, and a telephone encounter at 1 week to 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies conducted by our group with a similar patient population and study&#xD;
      protocol, we anticipate enrollment of 274 patients will take 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9) Study Endpoints*&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is failure of treatment at 7 days. This is defined as any of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Need for repeat incision and drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Need for additional antibiotic coverage&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospital Admission for intravenous antibiotics following the initial encounter 10)&#xD;
           Procedures Involved* Patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected&#xD;
           superficial abscesses that require an incision and drainage will be eligible for&#xD;
           enrollment. Patients will be randomized into one of two groups: 1) Ultrasound Guided&#xD;
           Incision and Drainage and 2) Standard Incision and Drainage. As a patient is identified&#xD;
           for enrollment, the investigator will open a study packet containing standardized data&#xD;
           collection sheet, consent documents and random designation for treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 Protocol: Ultrasound-guided Incision and Drainage Patients will be identified that&#xD;
      require Incision and Drainage. An initial ultrasound will be performed to localize the&#xD;
      abscess cavity. Anesthetic will be provided in the standard fashion by injected into the skin&#xD;
      around the abscess. Incision of the skin overlying the abscess cavity and drainage of the&#xD;
      purulent material will be followed by a repeat ultrasound to assess for complete drainage.&#xD;
      Any additional pockets identified will be targeted for drainage until repeated ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging demonstrates that the abscess cavity is completely drained. This post procedural&#xD;
      ultrasound is performed on all patients currently undergoing ultrasound guided drainage of a&#xD;
      superficial abscess. In patients where drainage cannot be completed, surgery will be&#xD;
      consulted. The procedure will then be completed with placement of an iodoform wick and bulky&#xD;
      dressing. Patients will be placed on oral antibiotics at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      attending physician and instructed to return in 2-3 days to the emergency department for&#xD;
      re-evaluation and wick removal or sooner if problems arise. If necessary, additional drainage&#xD;
      maybe performed. Additional I&amp;D will be performed with or without ultrasound at the&#xD;
      discretion of the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A telephone follow-up 7-10 days post-procedure will be performed. Questions asked in follow&#xD;
      up are located on the follow-up data sheet. See attachments or addendum. Blinding to the&#xD;
      treatment group is accomplished by having follow up to determine the outcome of the treatment&#xD;
      performed by an individual who is blinded to the initial ultrasound findings or treatment&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 Protocol: Standard Incision and Drainage Patients will be identified that require&#xD;
      Incision and Drainage*. Anesthetic will be provided in the standard fashion by injection in&#xD;
      the skin around the abscess. Incision of the skin overlying the abscess cavity and drainage&#xD;
      of the purulent material will be followed by placement of an iodoform wick and bulky&#xD;
      dressing. Patients will be placed on oral antibiotics at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      attending physician and instructed to return in 2 days to the emergency department for&#xD;
      re-evaluation and wick removal or sooner if problems arise. If necessary, additional drainage&#xD;
      maybe performed. Additional I&amp;D will be performed with or without ultrasound at the&#xD;
      discretion of the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A telephone follow-up 7 days post-procedure will be performed. This is the same follow up as&#xD;
      in group 1. The research personnel will introduce themselves as research personnel from UMASS&#xD;
      and will inform the subject that they are following up from their recent visit to the ED.&#xD;
      They will ask the questions from the telephone follow-up data sheet and will refer to it as&#xD;
      they conduct the follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding to the treatment group is accomplished by having follow up to determine the outcome&#xD;
      of the treatment performed by an individual who is blinded to the initial ultrasound findings&#xD;
      or treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *This decision may be made solely based on history and physical exam or by inital&#xD;
      identification with ultrasound. If the presence of an abscess is initially identified without&#xD;
      ultrasound, the original treating physician can continue to perform the Incision and Drainage&#xD;
      procedure. If the presence of an abscess is initially identified with an ultrasound then&#xD;
      another physician will need to perform the standard Incision and Drainage. The second&#xD;
      physician is at liberty to perform the standard history and physical to assess the presence&#xD;
      of the abscess prior to drainage. The second physician may be another resident or the&#xD;
      attending physician overseeing the patient's care, provided they are blinded to the initial&#xD;
      ultrasound identifying the presence of the abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized data sheet will record patient information, results of the procedure, time to&#xD;
      perform the procedure, need for additional drainage and post-procedure recurrence of the&#xD;
      abscess, need for change in oral antibiotic coverage and need for admission to the for&#xD;
      intravenous antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12) Data Management* Power Calcuation - Assuming an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.2 and&#xD;
      projected failure rate in the blind incision and drainage group of 20%, 119 subjects in each&#xD;
      group will be required to detect a 20% reduction in treatment failure. Accounting for a 15%&#xD;
      loss to follow-up will require a total number of subjects of 274 subjects. Patients assigned&#xD;
      to each group will undergo analysis using the intention to treat principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored on a password-protected computer in the locked offices of the department&#xD;
      of emergency medicine on the University Campus of UMASSMemorial Medical Center. Only study&#xD;
      personnel and the UMASS IRB will have access to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data will be analyzed using mean and standard deviation. Comparison between&#xD;
      groups will be performed using Chi square analysis (categorical data) and Student's T-test&#xD;
      (continuous data).&#xD;
