  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The loss of muscle mass and strength due to aging leads to serious health problems for older&#xD;
      adults. Muscle health can be improved by exercise training, but some people improve their&#xD;
      strength substantially, whereas others improve little. The reason for this variation is&#xD;
      unknown. This study will investigate whether function of the immune system influences how&#xD;
      well people respond to exercise. Older Veterans who participate will have their muscle size,&#xD;
      strength, and function measured periodically for almost a year. Participants will drink a&#xD;
      nutritional supplement or placebo daily and complete a 36 session strength training program.&#xD;
      Participants will be vaccinated for tetanus and donate small amounts of blood and muscle&#xD;
      tissue during the study so that immune function can be compared to muscle outcomes during&#xD;
      training and during a long-term follow-up. The study results should increase the&#xD;
      investigators' understanding of the negative effects of aging on muscle and will possibly&#xD;
      lead to better strategies for muscle maintenance and rehabilitation for older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: The study will examine the influence of immune function in older adults on&#xD;
      improvement of muscle mass, strength, and function by resistance training. The maintenance of&#xD;
      those benefits during long term follow-up will also be examined. This objective will be&#xD;
      accomplished by a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of a nutritional&#xD;
      supplement (Muscle Armor) which evidence suggests can improve immune function, promote muscle&#xD;
      growth, and counteract muscle loss. The study premise is that aging results in decreased&#xD;
      ability of the immune system to respond to stimuli such as exercise. The study proposes that&#xD;
      the supplement will improve muscle health by promoting a shift in immune function of older&#xD;
      adults from a pro-inflammatory state towards a state which supports muscle growth and&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: The study will randomize Veterans (age 60-80, N=50) to participate in the&#xD;
      supplement or placebo groups in a three phase study. The phases of participation correspond&#xD;
      to the three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine if 2-weeks of supplementation improves&#xD;
      immune function. Humoral immune function will be assessed as the response to vaccination.&#xD;
      Innate immune function will be measured as systemic and cellular responses to acute&#xD;
      resistance exercise that the investigators' previous studies indicate are affected by aging.&#xD;
      Aim 2 will determine if supplementation during 36 sessions of progressive high-intensity&#xD;
      resistance training boosts improvement in muscle size (CT scan), strength, and function (gait&#xD;
      and balance). Muscle adaptations at the cellular levels will also be measured. Aim 3 will&#xD;
      determine if continued supplementation for 26-weeks after completion of exercise training&#xD;
      promotes the retention of the gains in muscle size, strength, and function. Multivariable&#xD;
      testing will then be used to compare the results between Aims 1, 2, and 3 to determine&#xD;
      whether or not immune function is correlated with muscle adaptation to training or&#xD;
      detraining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants will undergo nine blood draws and five muscle biopsies of the vastus&#xD;
      lateralis over the course of the study so that the effects of the supplement on immune&#xD;
      function and cellular adaptations to training can be measured. Three of the blood draws will&#xD;
      be used to assess the antibody response to the tetanus, pertussis, and diphtheria vaccine.&#xD;
      Muscle and blood will be collected before and after a bout of exercise conducted before and&#xD;
      after the 2-weeks of supplementation prior to training. Immune function will be measured&#xD;
      using the blood based on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels, the balance between&#xD;
      specific T-cell subpopulations, and the proliferative capacity of mononuclear cells. Immune&#xD;
      function will be measured in muscle based on macrophage content of specific cytokines and&#xD;
      growth factors. The investigators' previous study showed that these muscle measures strongly&#xD;
      correlate with size and strength gain after training. Key signaling pathways including&#xD;
      nuclear factor-k B and PI3 kinase will also be measured. The fifth biopsy will be collected&#xD;
      post-training to measure adaptation at the cellular level based on changes in number of&#xD;
      satellite cells and myonuclei and fiber size. Hypotheses related to these measures will be&#xD;
      tested with 80% power to detect at least 0.8 standard deviations difference in means between&#xD;
      the supplement and placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance: Exercise is clearly able to affect immune function. However, the proposed&#xD;
      study will attempt to modulate immune function and determine the effects on exercise&#xD;
      outcomes. The study will also examine detraining, an important issue for older adults, that&#xD;
      is usually omitted from training studies. Thus, the study will potentially advance the&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms of muscle gain and loss in older adults, but more&#xD;
      importantly, the study will evaluate a nutritional intervention as a complement to exercise&#xD;
      for supporting muscle health during aging. Targeting the immune system may be the advantage&#xD;
      needed for an older Veteran to successfully maintain or restore the muscle mass, strength,&#xD;
      and function that is necessary for personal independence.&#xD;
