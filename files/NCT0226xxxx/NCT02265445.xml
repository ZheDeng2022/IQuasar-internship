      The study aims to evaluate a deescalating therapeutic strategy (switch the carbapenem to&#xD;
      another beta-lactam for which the isolated pathogen is susceptible) in patients with&#xD;
      well-defined ESBL-PE infections (usual sites of infections and non severe infections).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carbapenems are considered the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of infections due to&#xD;
      expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). Their use is readily&#xD;
      increasing because of the pandemic of ESBL-PE. However, the future of these drugs is&#xD;
      challenged by the worldwide emergency of new resistance mechanisms in the same pathogens,&#xD;
      particularly the carbapenemases. This resistance makes these drugs inactive and gives no&#xD;
      therapeutic options for patients. Resistance to carbapenems is strongly associated with the&#xD;
      use of these drugs, because of their large spectrum and strong impact on the host flora.&#xD;
      Consequently, the correct use of these drugs is an important public health objective. In&#xD;
      France, the CA-SFM (Committee on Antimicrobial of the French Society for Microbiology) has&#xD;
      suggested alternative strategies with narrow spectrum beta-lactam for the treatment of&#xD;
      ESBL-PE infections, including 3rd or 4th cephalosporins, cefoxitin and penicillins with&#xD;
      beta-lactamase inhibitors. A recent analysis including 6 prospective cohort studies of&#xD;
      bloodstream infections due to ESBL-producing Escherichia coli did not find an excess of&#xD;
      mortality or a longer length of hospital stay for patients receiving penicillin with&#xD;
      beta-lactamase inhibitors, as compared to patients treated with carbapenems, after adjusting&#xD;
      by confounding factors. As patients receiving carbapenems seem to be more severely affected,&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of the alternative strategy remain unproved. A randomized study is&#xD;
      therefore needed to evaluate a deescalating therapeutic strategy (switch the carbapenem to&#xD;
      another beta-lactam for which the isolated pathogen is susceptible) in patients with&#xD;
      well-defined ESBL-PE infections (usual sites of infections and non severe infections). The&#xD;
      objectives of the present study are to demonstrate that the alternative strategy of&#xD;
      deescalating therapy is not inferior to a strategy maintaining the carbapenem in terms of&#xD;
      clinical cure, survival, lack of relapse and microbiological cure.&#xD;
