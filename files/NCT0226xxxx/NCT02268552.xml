    <textblock>
      An open-label, multi-part, first-in-human study of oral branaplam in infants with Type 1&#xD;
      spinal muscular atrophy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy after 13 weeks; and to estimate the&#xD;
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of orally administered branaplam; and to identify the dose that&#xD;
      is safe for long term use as well as that can provide durable efficacy optimal dosing regimen&#xD;
      in patients with Type 1 SMA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-part, first-in-human, proof of concept study in infants with&#xD;
      Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy who have exactly 2 copies of SMN2, to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy of oral branaplam after 13 weeks treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parts 1 and 2 are intended to be non-confirmatory. In Part 1 of the study, patients will be&#xD;
      dosed once weekly with branaplam. The branaplam dose will be escalated in subsequent cohorts&#xD;
      until MTD is determined or when sufficient PK results confirm that the MTD cannot be reached&#xD;
      due to a potential pharmacokinetic plateau at higher doses. A decision to dose escalate the&#xD;
      next cohort will be made after safety data have been collected for 14 days following the&#xD;
      first dose (14-day DLT window). PK will be used to confirm that there is no accumulation of&#xD;
      the compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will enroll new patients into one of up to 3 dose cohorts with once&#xD;
      weekly dosing for 52 weeks. The branaplam dose will be escalated in subsequent cohorts after&#xD;
      6 patients have been enrolled and at least 3 patients from the previous cohort will have&#xD;
      completed 13 weeks of treatment. After 52 weeks, patients may continue treatment if Novartis,&#xD;
      the investigator and the independent DMC agree that this is in the best interest of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases continuation of the treatment will be done at a dose selected as optimum,&#xD;
      considering existing safety as well as efficacy data&#xD;
