  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is evaluate whether it's feasible to give radiation&#xD;
      therapy using an MRI-guided adaptive technique. MRI-guided adaptive radiation therapy&#xD;
      involves the adjustment or re-planning of treatment day by day while the participant is&#xD;
      receiving treatment. The adaptive technique has previously been used in a different fashion&#xD;
      to adjust the treatment plan after the fact, but using MRI scanning to re-plan treatment&#xD;
      while the participant is still on the table is a new way of using the adaptive technique.&#xD;
      This may allow doctors to use more radiation to treat the tumor while better protecting&#xD;
      normal tissues. A special radiation treatment machine incorporates both an MRI scanner and&#xD;
      radiation treatment devices so that the planning and treatment can be done using the same&#xD;
      machine.&#xD;

      In this trial, the feasibility of delivering online, adaptive MRI-guided stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy for oligometastatic disease using a novel, integrated Co-60-MRI machine&#xD;
      will be evaluated. To best assess this technology, we will focus on three specific&#xD;
      oligometastatic disease sites that have historically highlighted the limitations of SBRT.&#xD;
      Specifically, we will enroll patients with oligometastatic disease of the central thorax,&#xD;
      liver, and non-liver abdomen to receive adaptive, MRI-guided SBRT with MRI simulation and MRI&#xD;
      treatment gating. Patients will be treated in five fractions over one to two weeks. By&#xD;
      adhering to strict normal tissue constraints, expected toxicity will be within the current&#xD;
      standard of care, but allow adaptation based on daily anatomic changes. The prescription dose&#xD;
      will be determined based on above hard normal tissue constraints, and capped at 15 Gy per&#xD;
      fraction. Although our long-term goal will be to achieve improved local control and&#xD;
      disease-free survival with reduced toxicity, the present study will be driven by short-term&#xD;
      goals of demonstrating feasibility of an on-table adaptive approach, which has never&#xD;
      previously been reported.&#xD;
