      This is an open-label, follow-on phase 1 study to assess the long-term safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of continuous i.c.v administration of 4 μg sNN0029/day in patients with ALS who&#xD;

      This is an open-label, follow-on phase 1 study to assess the long-term safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of continuous i.c.v administration of sNN0029 infusion solution in patients with&#xD;
      ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighteen patients who previously participated in study sNN0029-003 will receive continuous&#xD;
      administration of 4 μg sNN0029/day via i.c.v. infusion with the Medtronic SynchroMed® II&#xD;
      Infusion System. The sNN0029 infusion solution is intended to be an add-on treatment to other&#xD;
      treatments for ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments performed at the last visit in study sNN0029-003 will serve as the baseline&#xD;
      values for patients included in study sNN0029-004 and be the start of sNN0029 treatment for&#xD;
      all patients (Study Day 1; Visit 1). In order to not reveal the blind in study sNN0029-003,&#xD;
      the patients will return to hospital on Day 3 and stay to Day 6 (Visit 2). During these days,&#xD;
      the sNN0029 begins to exit the i.c.v. catheter tip in the ventricle of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the hospital on Day 11 (Visit 3) for a refill of sNN0029 and&#xD;
      adjustment of the infusion pump flow rate. After this, the patient will return to the clinic&#xD;
      on Day 39 (Visit 4) for a sNN0029-refill of infusion pump and assessments. Thereafter the&#xD;
      patients will visit the hospital on a monthly basis (every 28 days ± 2) to perform refills&#xD;
      and make assessments every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in study sNN0029-004 may continue unless safety concerns warrant discontinuation of&#xD;
      therapy, until patients choose to withdraw from the study, experience treatment related&#xD;
      toxicity or intolerance, are deemed to be unsuitable to continue treatment by the&#xD;
      investigator, or die&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous participation in sNN0029-003 with completion of 12 weeks study without&#xD;
             clinically significant safety concerns&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Intact continuity of the Medtronic SynchroMed® II Infusion System as judged by X-ray&#xD;
             of head and abdominal area&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinical diagnosis of ALS classified as definite, or probable with or without&#xD;
             additional laboratory evidence, according to the revised WFN El Escorial criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has been given written and verbal information about the continuation study,&#xD;
             has had the opportunity to ask questions about the study, and understands the time and&#xD;
             procedural commitments&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has given oral and / or signed consent (written) to participate in the study.&#xD;
             In the event that a patient who gives oral informed consent is not physically able to&#xD;
             sign the informed consent form (ICF) due to disease progression, a witness may sign&#xD;
             the informed consent form on the patient's behalf&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg diastolic&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ophthalmological examination (fundus photography, visual acuity and perimetry) with&#xD;
             any clinically significant findings that imply safety concerns for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of risk for increased or uncontrolled bleeding and/or risk of bleeding that&#xD;
             cannot be not managed optimally due to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anatomical factors at or near the implant site (e.g., vascular abnormalities,&#xD;
                  neoplasms, or other abnormalities)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Underlying disorders of the coagulation cascade, platelet function, or platelet&#xD;
                  count (e.g., haemophilia, Von Willebrand's disease, liver disease, or other&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Presence of additional risk factors for thromboembolism such as obesity (Body mass&#xD;
             index [BMI] &gt; 35) or use of oestrogens including combined contraceptive pills&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinically significant abnormalities in haematology or clinical chemistry parameters&#xD;

             degenerative arthritis, compromised nutritional state, peripheral neuropathy) that&#xD;
             would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy of investigational product&#xD;
             or device performance, or would compromise the ability of the patient to undergo study&#xD;
             procedures (e.g., MRI), or to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For women only: pregnant, breast feeding and/or for fecund women unwillingness to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception during the trial such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception&#xD;
                  that do NOT contain oestrogens&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of an intrauterine device&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
