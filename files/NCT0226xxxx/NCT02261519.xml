  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed Phase IIb/III study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NaBen® in&#xD;
      improving the symptoms of schizophrenia in adults. NaBen® is granted Breakthrough Therapy&#xD;
      Designation by US FDA as add-on treatment for schizophrenia. The trial is designed as a&#xD;
      multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, in which adult subjects with&#xD;
      schizophrenia will be enrolled. The study will include four parts: a 2 week Screening part, a&#xD;
      4 week run-in part, an 8 week double-blind treatment part, and a 52 week Open-Label Extension&#xD;
      part.&#xD;

      This is an adaptive, phase IIb/III, multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study, in which adult subjects with schizophrenia will be enrolled. The study will include&#xD;
      four parts: a 2 week Screening part, a 4 week run-in part, and 8 week double-blind treatment&#xD;
      part, and a 52 week Open-Label Extension part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening part of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be evaluated for eligibility during the Screening part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrichment run-in part of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are determined to be eligible will enter the Run-in part of the study. A total&#xD;
      of 348 Subjects will be randomized. The randomized subjects will receive 4 weeks of NaBen® or&#xD;
      Placebo accordingly. The subjects who have completed 4 weeks of randomized treatment in both&#xD;
      groups (NaBen® or Placebo) will be assessed and categorized intoresponders and&#xD;
      non-responders, based on 20% or more reduction from baseline in their PANSS total scores as&#xD;
      per the evaluations at Visit 2 and Visit 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-Blind treatment part of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who have successfully completed the Enrichment Run-in part will enter the&#xD;
           Double- Blind treatment part of the study per below: NaBen® treated subjects: Subjects&#xD;
           will continue receiving NaBen® for another 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo treated subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Placebo Responders: Subjects will continue receiving Placebo for another 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Placebo Non-responders: Subjects will be re-randomized to receive NaBen® or Placebo&#xD;
                in a 1:1 ratio for another 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-Label Extension part of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who have completed the Double-Blind part of the study will continue with the&#xD;
      Open-Label Extension part of the study to receive NaBen® for an additional 52 weeks, plus a 2&#xD;
      week follow-up.&#xD;
