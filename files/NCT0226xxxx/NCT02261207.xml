    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated, open label, prospective, non-randomized, phase II trial&#xD;
      aimed at evaluating the activity of Axitinib in progressive VEGFR2 and/or PDGFRB positive&#xD;
      advanced Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT) patients. Patients with a documented and centrally&#xD;
      reviewed pathologic and radiologic diagnosis of progressive VEGFR2 and/or PDGFRB positive&#xD;
      advanced SFT may enter in the study. Axitinib will be administered at the dose of 5mg twice a&#xD;
      day, continuously. Treatment will be continued till evidence of progression, or toxicities or&#xD;
      patient withdrawal.&#xD;

      This is an investigator initiated, open label, prospective, non-randomized, phase II trial&#xD;
      aimed at evaluating the activity of Axitinib in progressive VEGFR2 and/or PDGFRB positive&#xD;
      advanced Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT) patients. Patients with a documented and centrally&#xD;
      reviewed pathologic and radiologic diagnosis of progressive VEGFR2 and/or PDGFRB positive&#xD;
      advanced SFT may enter in the study. Axitinib will be administered at the dose of 5mg twice a&#xD;
      day, continuously. Treatment will be continued till evidence of progression, or toxicities or&#xD;
      patient withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activity of Axitinib will be evaluated in terms of overall response rate according to&#xD;
      Choi Criteria as defined for GIST patients treated with Imatinib, extended even to MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study will be: response rate by RECIST, progression free&#xD;
      survival, overall survival, clinical benefit (RECIST Complete Response + Partial Response +&#xD;
      Stable Disease &gt;6 months). Whenever possible a post-treatment biopsy will be performed to&#xD;
      assess Axitinib targets status after treatment and to correlate their status to the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessment with CT scan and/or MRI will be performed within 4 weeks prior to first dose&#xD;
      of Axitinib and after 4 weeks from starting treatment, then every 2 months until progression&#xD;
      or toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per protocol the experimental treatment can be administered in front or further line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be considered positive if 30% of response rate by Choi criteria is observed.&#xD;
      To this end a maximum of 16 evaluable patients will be enrolled in two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of positive study the trial will be re-open to confirm the result in a larger number&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
