      This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EEG/ECG-guided magnetic resonant therapy&#xD;
      (MRT) in combat veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. A total of 2004 subjects will be&#xD;
      treated in two phases: double-blind and open label.&#xD;

The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) is a 17-item metric to rate subjects on severity of depressive symptoms. Total scores range from 0-52, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms; a score of 0-7 is generally accepted to be within normal range (or in remission), while a score of 20 or greater indicates moderate to severe depression.</description>

            <description>Sham treatment devices simulate the behavior of the active devices by mimicking the same noise and sensation of active treatment without applying the magnetic field. Sham treatments are administered for 6 seconds/minute for 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week for two weeks. Active devices were used for the additional two weeks of open-label treatment.</description>

          <title>Mean (SD) Change in World Health Organization's Quality of Life Index (WHO-QOL) Domain Score From Baseline to End of Open-Label Treatment</title>
          <description>Mean change in each WHO-QOL domain score from baseline to end of open-label treatment, compared between active and sham groups.&#xD;
The World Health Organization's Quality of Life Index - BREF Version (WHO-QOL) is a metric used to establish the subject's quality of life in four domains: physical health (D1), psychological health (D2), social relationships (D3), and environmental health (D4). Higher scores indicate a more positive quality of life; D1 has a score range of 7-35, D2 has a range of 6-30, D3 has a range of 3-15, D4 has a range of 8-40.</description>
          <population>96 participants were randomized into the trial, 86 completed treatment protocol. Of those, 6 were excluded from final analyses for failing to meet protocol requirements. Analyses were performed on the remaining 80 subjects.</population>
