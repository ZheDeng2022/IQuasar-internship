      The goal of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of Breathing Focused Yoga&#xD;
      (BFY) in improving symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD). Patients with SAD will be&#xD;
      randomized to 8 weeks of yoga or 8 weeks of wait-list. Symptom severity and quality of life&#xD;
      will be compared between the two groups before and after the 8 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory 8-week study with a randomized controlled, parallel group design, and&#xD;
      will be carried out in two phases: 1) 8-week treatment phase and 2) a 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV Text Revision, (DSM-IV-TR),&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder will be recruited. Patients who have provided&#xD;
      written consent, have met study criteria, and are stabilized on pharmacotherapy will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment phase, patients will be randomized, to one of two groups 1) Breathing&#xD;
      Focused Yoga (BFY); or 2) wait-list group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub-set of 15 drug- naïve patients and matched healthy controls will undergo functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans before and after yoga treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample for genetic analysis will be taken from all SAD patients, to investigate to&#xD;
      presence of genes linked to SAD and t treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of Breathing&#xD;
      Focused Yoga (BFY) in improving symptoms of SAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To enhance the limited research data on the effect of treatment on neural circuitry in&#xD;
           SAD, the investigators will also conduct fMRI scans on SAD patients and matched healthy&#xD;
           controls pre- and post-BFY intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As well, to add to the literature on the genetics of SAD, the investigators will&#xD;
           validate the links between specific gene polymorphisms and SAD that are already&#xD;
           identified in the literature, and evaluate if they predict treatment response following&#xD;
           BFY intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects with Social Anxiety Disorder will show significant improvement in symptoms&#xD;
           after BFY, compared to the wait-list group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improvement in quality of life scores will be significantly greater in the BFY group&#xD;
           compared to the wait-list group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At baseline, the fMRI indications of neural circuitry of SAD subjects will differ from&#xD;
           that of healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After yoga treatment, the fMRI indications of neural circuitry of treatment responders&#xD;
           in the SAD group will be similar to that of healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The presence of specific gene polymorphisms in SAD patients will predict treatment&#xD;
           response.&#xD;

    <description>The breathing focused yoga intervention is a manualized yoga protocol developed at CAMH by the Mood and Anxiety Disorders group, with yoga teacher, Ms. Tiffany Garfinkel, as the lead. BFY incorporates postures and meditation, but there is a special focus on controlled breathing at different rates, including Ujjaji or slow inhalation, exhalation and holding of breath; Bhastrika or Kapalabhati, two types of vigorous breathing with forced exhalation; and cyclical breathing or a repeated pattern of slow, moderate and fast breathing.</description>
