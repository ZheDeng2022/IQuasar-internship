      This project randomizes two different screening strategies for diabetes in pregnancy, among a&#xD;
      study population of over 17,500 pregnant women and their babies (over 35,000 total) in a&#xD;
      large diverse health maintenance organization (HMO), to determine how diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      based on these two strategies in routine clinical care affects complications for the baby and&#xD;
      the mother.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Two recent randomized placebo-controlled trials show that gestational diabetes (GDM)&#xD;
      treatment (vs. none) improves maternal and perinatal outcomes, based on diagnosis with a 2-&#xD;
      step screening strategy. Also, a large multi-center prospective cohort study showed a linear&#xD;
      relationship with glucose and maternal and perinatal outcomes, based on screening with a&#xD;
      single 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Based on this large cohort's findings, the&#xD;
      American Diabetes Association recommended that clinical practice adopt the 1-step 75g&#xD;
      screening approach for diagnosing GDM. The American College of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology took&#xD;
      the opposite stance, recommending the traditional 2-step screening: because it alone has RCT&#xD;
      outcome evidence. What is urgently needed to best inform clinical practice and health policy&#xD;
      is not an additional GDM treatment vs. control trial, but a pragmatic randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) testing the 2 recommended clinical strategies. To pragmatically address this&#xD;
      critical research gap, we propose to randomize an estimated 17,626 diverse women to GDM&#xD;
      screening (2-step vs. 75g OGTT) as part of their clinical care in the Kaiser Permanente&#xD;
      Northwest (KPNW) and Hawaii (KPH) regional health plans. The investigators will use the&#xD;
      plans' electronic medical record (EMR) system at the time of GDM screening to randomize the&#xD;
      women. Both KPNW and KPH regions universally screen for GDM at 24-28 weeks gestation, as part&#xD;
      of clinical care. By randomizing GDM screening in the context of clinical care, the&#xD;
      investigators will: Compare GDM prevalences (Aim 1) and differences in maternal and perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes between screening strategies (Aim 2). Determine the concordance of the 75g OGTT with&#xD;
      GDM diagnosed by 2-step, among a recruited sub-sample of 1,000 pregnant women at KPNW and KPH&#xD;
      (Aim 3). The results of this pragmatic RCT are expected to help resolve the current public&#xD;
      policy debate on the potential benefits and risks of each strategy in clinical obstetric&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

    <description>This pragmatic GDM screening RCT evaluates rates of multiple maternal and child GDM-associated outcomes with two standard-of-care screening strategies in a large population of pregnant women at two diverse HMO sites with routine universal screening for GDM. This first primary outcome encompasses the overarching goals of our pragmatic RCT, and other specific primary outcomes will be listed as subsequent primary outcome measures. This outcome was initially registered as an overall primary outcome and was intended (as stated in the study protocol) to include the number of pregnancies diagnosed with GDM based on laboratory values of the two screening approaches; the primary GDM diagnosis has been updated separately as a primary outcome as per protocol.</description>
