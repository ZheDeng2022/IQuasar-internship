      The purpose of this research is to design and test a new model for delivery of well-child&#xD;
      care (WCC) for children ages 0-3 years in a sample of low-income parents. The investigators&#xD;
      used an innovative expert panel and community advisory board process to develop this new&#xD;
      model for the delivery of WCC to low-income families in partnership with our partner&#xD;
      community pediatric practices. The new model of care utilizes a trained health educator, or&#xD;
      &quot;Parent Coach&quot; at every well-visit from 0-3 years of age. The Parent Coach provides a range&#xD;
      of services, including health education and guidance, developmental screening, and&#xD;
      psychosocial screening and services. The Parent Coach works with the Primary Care Physician&#xD;
      to ensure that the family's needs are met for that well-visit. As a part of this new model&#xD;
      for well-child care, the parent also uses a web-based tool to help prioritize needs for the&#xD;
      visit and complete any necessary pre-visit screening. Parents receive additional education&#xD;
      and guidance from a text message service and have access to the Parent Coach outside of the&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized controlled trial (RCT) of this new model of care will include 250 families who&#xD;
      will be enrolled at participating clinics if the child is under 1 year of age. Parents will&#xD;
      receive the intervention for 12 months and will complete surveys to collect data on their&#xD;
      experiences of care. Our hypothesis is that this new model of care will be more&#xD;
      patient-centered and more effective in providing recommended preventive care services than&#xD;
      usual care, and that it will be a sustainable and feasible model for the partner practices.&#xD;

      During Phase 1, we used an innovative expert panel and community advisory board process to&#xD;
      develop a new structural model for delivery of well-child care (WCC) to low-income families.&#xD;
      The new model of care was developed using a WCC Framework that considered alternative&#xD;
      structure for care: non-physician providers (nurses, lay health educators, social workers),&#xD;
      non-traditional formats (group visits, internet, phone), and non-clinical locations (daycare&#xD;
      centers, home visits, grocery stores) for each of six major WCC visits (physical exam,&#xD;
      immunizations/laboratory screening, behavioral/developmental services, anticipatory guidance,&#xD;
      psychosocial screenings, and sick visits/after-hours care), as well as a feasible mechanism&#xD;
      for provider reimbursement. The model that was developed was a Team-Based Care, Parent Coach&#xD;
      Model for WCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of study participants carried on for approximately six months. We posted flyers&#xD;
      in two Los Angeles pediatric clinics. The flyers instructed parents to contact the study&#xD;
      investigators by phone or email, or alternatively speak with the office receptionist, if&#xD;
      interested in participating. A bilingual (English and Spanish) research associate (RA) was&#xD;
      available 2-3 days per week in each clinic site to answer questions that interested parents&#xD;
      may have had; that person was also available by phone and email 5 days a week to respond to&#xD;
      requests for information. A parent who saw a flyer in the clinic on the day of their visit&#xD;
      could have approached the clinic receptionist, expressed an interest in the study, and then&#xD;
      directed to either speak with the RA in a private room at the clinic. Additionally, when&#xD;
      parents arrived for a visit for a child in the age range specified for the study, they were&#xD;
      handed a 1-page flyer regarding the study during check-in at the receptionist's desk. The&#xD;
      flyers instructed parents to call, email, or speak in person privately with the study RA if&#xD;
      they were interested in participating or needed more information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible parents were informed of their intervention assignment and were asked for contact&#xD;
      information and to complete a 10 minute survey. All parents were informed that they would be&#xD;
      contacted 6-months and 12-months post-enrollment to complete two additional surveys. Parents&#xD;
      in the intervention group were informed that they may be randomly selected to participate in&#xD;
      an additional component to provide study staff with additional information regarding the&#xD;
      health services that the parent received during the 12 months that he/she was enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During enrollment the parents in the intervention group were informed of the additional&#xD;
      services available to them. Parents were able to enroll in a text messaging program which&#xD;
      provides parents with age-tailored health information through texts. The texts are available&#xD;
      in English and Spanish. They contain information such as: car seat safety, dental care for&#xD;
      baby and reminders to schedule child's physicals. The second service available to parents is&#xD;
      a web-based parent tool called the Well Visit Planner (WVP) tool. The tool gives parents the&#xD;
      opportunity to customize their child's upcoming routine physical. The WVP also gives the&#xD;
      parents an opportunity to learn about developmental milestones that their child should be&#xD;
      meeting. Lastly, parents are given the opportunity to choose priorities to discuss with the&#xD;
      physician and the Parent Coach. The data from the pre-visit tool is automatically uploaded to&#xD;
      the electronic health record, where red flags indicate areas of further need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Parent Coach is also available to intervention patients at the two participating clinics.&#xD;
      The Parent Coach is a trained child bilingual health education specialist that will be&#xD;
      available at each clinic at least two days a week and over the phone at least one day a week.&#xD;
      She is available to help parents schedule appointments and review flagged items on the Well&#xD;
      Visit Planner tool. The Parent Coach addresses psychosocial, developmental and behavioral&#xD;
      concerns that parents may have. She is also gives parents tips on how parents can help their&#xD;
      baby grow and develop. In addition, she is trained to check if the baby is developing&#xD;
      normally and if there is reason for concern she will bring it to the attention of the&#xD;
      pediatrician at clinic and help parents with referrals for further testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment into the RCT began in June 2013 and ran through December 2013. We enrolled 251&#xD;
      patients over two clinical sites. Half of the participants at each clinic were placed in the&#xD;
      control group (n= 125) and the other half in the intervention group (n=126). Research&#xD;
      associates are available over the phone and in person at to complete parents follow- up&#xD;
      surveys. The 12 month post enrollment surveys are schedule to be completed in December 2014.&#xD;
