      Study primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the bioequivalent rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC0-t) of absorption of&#xD;
      N-acetyl-cysteine 600 mg uncoated tablets vs. N-acetyl-cysteine 600 mg film-coated tablets&#xD;
      (NAC) in healthy male and female volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of NAC in plasma after single dose&#xD;
           administration of NAC 600 mg uncoated tablets vs. NAC 600 mg film-coated tablets;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to collect safety and tolerability data after single dose administration of NAC 600 mg&#xD;
           uncoated tablets vs. NAC 600 mg film-coated tablets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is single centre, single dose, open, randomised, cross-over, two-stage bioequivalence&#xD;
      study to compare two different oral formulations of NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been conducted in healthy volunteers of both genders, in one single dose of&#xD;
      both formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial 48 subjects were sufficient to satisfy the study objectives on the basis of the&#xD;
      ad interim preliminary bioequivalence test. The study was then considered as concluded and&#xD;
      the second stage did not take place.&#xD;

      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were assigned to a sequence of treatments (TR or RT) according to the randomisation list. Randomisation number was given to the subjects on study day -1, Period 1, and was used to assign the treatment sequence according to the randomisation list.&#xD;
The randomisation list was computer-generated by the Contract Research Organisation (CRO) Biometry Unit, using the PLAN procedure of SAS® version 9.3 (TS1M1) (24). The randomisation list was supplied to the Phase I Unit before study start.</pre_assignment_details>
