  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare a 2nd generation Buprenorphine Transdermal System (BTDS) patch with a marketed 1st&#xD;
      generation BTDS patch to confirm that the two are bioequivalent (deliver the same amount of&#xD;
      drug) and that they equally both stick to the skin over 7 days of continuous wear.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to compare a 2nd generation BTDS patch 20 µg/h to the 1st generation patch&#xD;
      to confirm bioequivalence. Determination will be via measurement of drug concentrations in&#xD;
      the blood at serial collection time points pre-dose until 288 hours post-patch application.&#xD;
      Approximately 100 healthy male and female volunteers will receive both BTDS patches across&#xD;
      two study periods with a 14-day wash-out between applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patch will be worn for 7 consecutive days and the study will also review the adhesion of&#xD;
      each patch to the skin of the subjects. The overall safety and tolerability of both patches&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Healthy male or female subjects aged 18 to 55 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female subjects of child bearing potential must be willing to use two highly effective&#xD;
             methods of contraception throughout the study, one of which must include a barrier&#xD;
             method. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in&#xD;
             a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly&#xD;
             such as sterilisation, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs&#xD;
             (Intrauterine Device), true sexual abstinence when this is in line with the preferred&#xD;
             and usual lifestyle of the subject (periodic abstinence e.g. calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods, declaration of abstinence for the duration of&#xD;
             the trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception) or vasectomised&#xD;
             partner. Acceptable barrier methods are either their partner's use of a condom or the&#xD;
             subject's use of an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal&#xD;
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female subjects who are postmenopausal (defined as spontaneous amenorrhoea for at&#xD;
             least 1 year) or permanently sterilised (e.g. tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             salpingectomy). These subjects are not required to use any contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male subjects who are willing to use contraception with their partners throughout the&#xD;
             study and for 30 days after completion of the study and agree to inform the&#xD;
             Investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Body weight ranging from 55 to 100 kg and a BMI ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 29.9.&#xD;

             physical examination, vital signs, laboratory tests and ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willing to eat all the food supplied throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject's primary care physician has confirmed within the last 12 months of the&#xD;
             initial dosing date, that there is nothing in the subject's medical history that would&#xD;
             preclude their enrolment into a clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Will refrain from strenuous exercise during the entire study. They will not begin a&#xD;
             new exercise program nor participate in any unusually strenuous physical exertion.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any history of drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any history of conditions that might interfere with drug absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism or excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of opioid or opioid antagonist-containing medication in the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any history of frequent nausea or vomiting regardless of aetiology.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (e.g. heart failure,&#xD;
             hypokalaemia, personal or family history of long QT syndrome, syncope, or family&#xD;
             history of sudden death).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Abnormal cardiac conditions including any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;

             excipients or any contraindications as detailed in the Butrans Summary of Product&#xD;
             Characteristics or Nemexin Summary of Product Characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Clinically significant history of allergic reaction to wound dressings or elastoplast.&#xD;
