    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single center clinical trial to assess corneal sensitivity and&#xD;
      nerve fiber morphology in patients with sleep apnea compared to normal controls. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers with no history of ocular or uncontrollable systemic disease will be encouraged to&#xD;
      participate in the study. After execution and review of the consenting procedures, a detailed&#xD;
      history will be taken and a slit lamp examination performed, verifying ocular health. This&#xD;
      consists of an examination of both eyes including assessments of ocular lids, lashes, cornea&#xD;
      and conjunctival evaluation. Corneal touch thresholds will be tested with a Cochet-Bonnet&#xD;
      aesthesiometer, a standard non-invasive measure of corneal sensitivity. Corneal nerves will&#xD;
      be imaged using a modified HRT in vivo confocal microscope. The in vivo confocal microscope&#xD;
      allows for high resolution imaging of the nerve plexus under the corneal epithelium. This&#xD;
      corneal nerve plexus is responsible for corneal sensitively and changes or loss have been&#xD;
      established as an early, sensitive indicator of corneal neuropathy. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that this study will require approximately 30 patients for each group and will&#xD;
      last approximately 12 months for recruitment and completion of subject visit phases. There is&#xD;
      only one clinical visit designed for this project, unscheduled visits may be scheduled in&#xD;
      case of an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment will be complete at the one-year time point. At the 14 month time point,&#xD;
      all data points will have been collected and assessment of the outcome measure (corneal&#xD;
      sensitivity in sleep apnea patients versus control patients) will be complete.&#xD;

      Screening Assessment: Following the execution of informed consent, subjects will be carefully&#xD;
      screened for ocular signs and symptoms, consistent with the protocol inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. This includes review of ocular and medical history including use of concomitant &amp;&#xD;
      ocular medications and surgeries performed in the past. Researchers will also collect age,&#xD;
      ethnicity, demographics, ophthalmic notes and eye exam history. Upon completion of the&#xD;
      screening exam, subjects will be deemed eligible based on study criteria the testing&#xD;
      procedures will be performed by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing procedures: The visit will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slit Lamp Microscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ocular examination of the external (lids, lashes) along with internal (cornea, lens,&#xD;
      retina) structures of the eye can be performed with the aid of a slit lamp. This instruments&#xD;
      uses lenses and an external light source that can be refracted at different angles and&#xD;
      intensities to assess ocular structures for diagnostic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corneal sensitivity measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Corneal touch sensitivity will be determined using a Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer&#xD;
           mounted on a standard slit lamp biomicroscope. The Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer is&#xD;
           routinely used for clinical research purposes to investigate corneal touch thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For sensitivity measurements, a 0.12 mm diameter nylon thread will be slowly brought&#xD;
           forward to briefly touch the cornea perpendicularly and then quickly withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. On each occasion, the patient will be asked to respond whenever a stimulus is felt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Thread length is used to quantitatively assess sensitivity. The longest thread length is&#xD;
           used first (6 cm), as this provides the lowest stimulus intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If the subject is unable to detect the touch stimulus, the thread will be systematically&#xD;
           shortened in length by 0.5 cm steps until the stimulus is felt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The criterion for the sensitivity threshold will be the filament length which gives a&#xD;
           50% positive response from four stimulus applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Vivo Confocal Microscope&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Corneal nerves will be imaged using a modified in vivo confocal microscope which is&#xD;
           routinely used in our clinics (HRT Rostock corneal module, Heidelberg Engineering).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The HRT In Vivo Confocal microscope was modified by adding a motor to automate the&#xD;
           focus. This does not alter the integrity, the application, the intent or the light&#xD;
           source of the instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Corneas will be anesthetized with a topical anesthetic, proparacaine, prior to scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The confocal microscope will briefly touch the patient's eye and the images saved for&#xD;
           further analysis.&#xD;
