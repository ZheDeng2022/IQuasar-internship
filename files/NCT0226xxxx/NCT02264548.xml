      -  evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of renal radio-ablation in the setting of&#xD;
           metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

      A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as any grade 3, 4 or 5 toxicity event that is&#xD;
      considered to be definitely, probably or possibility related to the protocol radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Patients that cannot complete protocol therapy due to acute radiation side-effects&#xD;
      will also be considered to be a DLT. The general (non-exhausive) list of organ based toxicity&#xD;
      that could be related to this type of radiation therapy include toxicity to the liver,&#xD;
      kidney, bowel, spinal cord, and pancreas. Side-effects that are exclusively due to TKI&#xD;
      targeted therapy are not considered to be DLT in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three patients will be recruited for the first cohort of the trial. These patients will have&#xD;
      the PTV prescribed a dose of 25 Gray to be given in 5 daily fractions over a period of one&#xD;
      week (first treatment to start on a Wednesday or Thursday, with planned treatment on&#xD;
      successive business days). All therapy should be delivered within 10 business days including&#xD;
      any treatment breaks for acute toxicity. After 3 patients have been seen at the 4 week follow&#xD;
      up visit, CTCAE version three will be noted. If precisely 1 patient has a DLT, then an&#xD;
      additional 3 patients will be recruited to the same cohort and given the same treatment. If&#xD;
      no patient has DLT, then a new cohort of 3 patients will be treated to an increased dose of&#xD;
      30 Gray in 5 fractions. Similar criteria will dictate whether the trial ends, or continues&#xD;
      with the next cohort being treated to a dose of 35 Gray in 5 daily fractions. There will be a&#xD;
      maximum of 4 cohorts (25Gy, 30Gy, 35Gy, and 40Gy) in this study assuming no early DLT issues,&#xD;
      each containing 3 or 6 patients. Allowance for a -1 cohort arm of 20 Gy in 5 fractions is&#xD;
      made in this protocol for early DLT issues. The diagram below displays the schema in more&#xD;
      detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient that does not complete protocol therapy due to toxicity issues or is unavailable&#xD;
      for the 4-week toxicity assessment is considered to be non-evaluable. These patients will&#xD;
      need to be replaced in terms of study accrual. Patients are not to be given TKI therapy&#xD;
      during the 4 week window post-RT in order to allow for proper evaluation of the RT&#xD;
      intervention; however, the treating oncologist ultimately can override this if it is in the&#xD;
      best medical interest of the patient (e.g. progressive and symptomatic systemic disease)&#xD;
