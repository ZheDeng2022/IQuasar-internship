  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The universe of tobacco products is expanding, with new noncombustible products gaining&#xD;
      popularity even as the reduction in prevalence of cigarette smoking slows or stalls.&#xD;
      E-cigarettes, or Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), are the most prevalent of these&#xD;
      emerging noncombustible products. With sales increasing rapidly and more efficient pulmonary&#xD;
      delivery devices under development, ENDS are likely to play an increasing role in the future&#xD;
      tobacco market. Little is known about the cognitions and behaviors leading to or sustaining&#xD;
      ENDS use. Smokers may use ENDS to subvert smoking restrictions, to reduce perceived smoking&#xD;
      harms, or for smoking cessation. Evidence about ENDS use is emerging from national&#xD;
      surveillance and laboratory research, but the majority of information on ENDS is limited to&#xD;
      retrospective surveys and convenience samples of White male ENDS users. The investigators&#xD;
      research suggests Black smokers are less likely than White smokers to try and be current ENDS&#xD;
      users, perhaps due to a greater degree of perceived harm associated with ENDS, a preference&#xD;
      for menthol, or cultural norms. Thus, it is timely and critical to study how all smokers,&#xD;
      including Blacks and menthol smokers, experience and initiate ENDS use employing valid,&#xD;
      innovative research methods.&#xD;

        In total, our goal is to enroll 150 individuals, with 120 participants completing the&#xD;
        protocol. For the main arm of the study, we will recruit a racially and ethnically diverse&#xD;
        sample of 140 daily smokers (or 100 study completers), with the goal of recruiting at least&#xD;
        50% non-Hispanic black participants. For the second study arm, we will enroll an additional&#xD;
        30 participants, with the goal of 20 individuals completing the protocol. There are no&#xD;
        race/ethnicity recruitment goals associated with the second arm. In total, the main study&#xD;
        arm will consist of 100 daily smokers who do not intend to quit smoking in the next 30&#xD;
        days, while the second arm will include 20 daily smokers who do intend to quit smoking in&#xD;
        the next 30 days.&#xD;
