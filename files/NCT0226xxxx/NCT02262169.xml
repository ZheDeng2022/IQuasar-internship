  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-arm, prospective, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized-controlled study using&#xD;
      DLBS2411 at a dose of 250 mg twice daily (before morning and evening meals), or omeprazole at&#xD;
      a dose of 40 mg once daily (before morning meal), for an 8-week course of therapy, for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with any non-bleeding peptic ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLBS2411 is a bioactive fraction of an Indonesian native herbal, Cinnamomum burmanii, locally&#xD;
      known as kayu manis have been proven at cellular and genetic levels to have an antiulcer&#xD;
      effect through both suppressing the gastric acidity and enhancing gastric mucosal protection.&#xD;
      The anti-secretory effect of DLBS2411 is exerted through the inhibition of H+/K+ ATPase&#xD;
      'pump' as well as down-regulation of the H+/K+ ATPase gene expression, thus suppressing&#xD;
      gastric acid secretion; while its gastro-protective defense mechanism works through the&#xD;
      promotion of COX-2 derived prostaglandin (PgE2) synthesis, stimulating gastric-epithelial&#xD;
      mucous and bicarbonate secretion; anti-oxidative activity; and endothelial-nitric oxide (NO)&#xD;
      formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent study of DLBS2411 in healthy volunteers demonstrated the effective role and safety of&#xD;
      DLBS2411 in suppressing intragastric acidity. Having such mechanisms of action, DLBS2411 is&#xD;
      hypothesized to benefit in peptic ulcers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 140 subjects will be allocated into 2 groups of treatment; each group will consist&#xD;
      of 70 subjects with the treatment regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment I : 2 capsules of Omeprazole 20 mg, once daily and 1 placebo caplet of DLBS2411,&#xD;
      twice daily Treatment II : 1 caplet of DLBS2411 250 mg, twice daily and 2 placebo capsules of&#xD;
      omeprazole, once daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLBS2411 will be administered twice daily at least 30 minutes before morning and evening&#xD;
      meals, while omeprazole, once daily before morning meals, for 8 weeks of study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible subjects will receive either study medication (Treatment 1 or Treatment 2), for&#xD;
      8 weeks of treatment; and will be instructed to come to the clinic every 4-week interval&#xD;
      throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for treatment efficacy at baseline and at interval of 4 weeks over&#xD;
      the 8-week course of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety profile of study medication other than vital signs and adverse event will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline and end of study. Vital signs and adverse event will be measured at&#xD;
      baseline and every follow-up visit including end of study.&#xD;
