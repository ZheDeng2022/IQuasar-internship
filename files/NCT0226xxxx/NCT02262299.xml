&#xD;
        -  Change in EQ5D scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment failure during the study is defined as one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Redo transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death due to respiratory causes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initiation of rescue therapy for worsening of BOS (worsening of BOS defined as a decline&#xD;
           of at least 600mL in 3 consecutive months) o Photophoresis, Montelukast or other&#xD;
           treatment considered as rescue therapy by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Imputation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ITT primary endpoint analysis, missing data due to treatment failure and death will be&#xD;
      imputed as 50% of baseline FEV1. For patients lost to follow-up or who withdrew from the&#xD;
      study for reasons not related to BOS, the last measured FEV1 (ml) will be imputed as the 6&#xD;
      month value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SD: To determine the SD of the FEV1 decline in the population, the 5 members of the&#xD;
           Steering committee collected the data from patients meeting the inclusion criteria. Mean&#xD;
           decline in FEV1 (in a 6 month period) in this sample was 561 ml and the SD of the&#xD;
           decline was 300 ml .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment effect: A meaningful treatment effect of 50% should be expected based on the&#xD;
           mechanism of disease and preliminary data in BOS (In the publication) and personal&#xD;
           experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One standard deviation (SD) of FEV1 in groups will be assumed to be 300 mL based on data from&#xD;
      expert centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly decline in FEV1 at onset of BOS is assumed to be approximately 75 ml, in 6 months 450&#xD;
      ml decline in FEV1 is expected for the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A treatment effect of 50% reduction in decline is expected with Pirfenidone, which will lead&#xD;
      to an expected mean decline of 225 ml in 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a beta error of 12% (power 88%) the study will be able to detect a difference of 225 ml&#xD;
      between the two treatment groups with a sample size of 36 patients in each group using a&#xD;
      two-sided t-test with significance level of 0.05. An estimated 80 patients will be recruited&#xD;
      to the trial allowing for a drop-out rate of 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant treatment - Stopping Azithromycin will be allowed if not tolerated. Standard&#xD;
      treatment is continuation of Azithromycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initiation on new bronchodilator therapy is not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photopheresis and Montelukast are not allowed while on Pirfenidone Study Committees&#xD;
           Steering Committee: M. Perch, P. Corris, G. Verleden, J. Gotlieb and E Verschuuren&#xD;
           Patient Review Committee Inclusion Criteria, exclusion criteria and BOS staging for all&#xD;
           patients enrolled will be reviewed by a committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Events Committee Group of physicians who will review the serious adverse events that&#xD;
      occur during the study to adjudicate their relationship to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSMB Independent group to review the safety and efficacy data during the study.&#xD;
