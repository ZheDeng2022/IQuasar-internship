      Childhood obesity is a major area of concern for health care and public health. Overweight&#xD;
      children are more likely overweight and obese adults. Chronic health problems associated with&#xD;
      adult obesity are now occurring more frequently in children. Because of the associated health&#xD;
      problems and potential for long term struggles with obesity, intervention early in life is&#xD;
      essential for addressing the obesity epidemic. Some intervention work in this area has&#xD;
      focused on the pediatric primary care setting in order to utilize the influence and&#xD;
      credibility of medical providers. Unfortunately, primary care visits are often too short to&#xD;
      spend a significant amount of time on issues of diet, weight and nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been very little work exploring the potential of alternative care settings, such as&#xD;
      the pediatric Emergency Department (ED) in addressing childhood obesity. While provider time&#xD;
      is also limited in the ED, there is often a considerable amount of downtime during emergency&#xD;
      department visits that could be valuable time for patient and parent education. There may&#xD;
      also be an opportunity to reach parents and children in the ED who do not regularly utilize&#xD;
      primary care. In order to explore the possibility of pediatric obesity interventions in&#xD;
      Children's Pediatric Emergency Department, we will need to measure the prevalence of obesity&#xD;
      in the population that utilizes the Children's ED. The height of patients seen in the ED is&#xD;
      not routinely measured, which makes calculating BMI to determine obesity impossible. This&#xD;
      study, establishing the prevalence of obesity in Children's Emergency Department will lay the&#xD;
      groundwork for future work addressing obesity in the ED.&#xD;

      Background/Significance Childhood obesity is a well-documented public health crisis. Data&#xD;
      from the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination survey (NHANES) indicate that&#xD;
      the prevalence of obesity is 8.4% in 2 to 5-year-olds, 17.7% in 6 to 11-year-olds, and 20.5%&#xD;
      in 12 to 19-year-olds (1). Large racial/ethnic disparities in risk for obesity are already&#xD;
      present by the preschool years (2). In 2 to 5-year-olds, 3.5% of non-Hispanic white children&#xD;
      are obese, compared to 11.3% of non-Hispanic black and 16.7% of Hispanic children (1). Many&#xD;
      health problems that were previously associated only with adult obesity are now being seen in&#xD;
      youth, including the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular abnormalities&#xD;
      (3). Obesity tracks into adulthood, highlighting the need for early intervention (4).&#xD;
      Overweight children have more chronic conditions, a greater risk of emergency department&#xD;
      visits, and significantly higher costs for common pediatric hospitalizations (5-7).&#xD;
      Successfully addressing the childhood obesity epidemic will require coordinated and&#xD;
      collective efforts across many settings including multiple healthcare settings (8). Obesity&#xD;
      interventions are increasingly being developed that utilize the influential role and&#xD;
      credibility of pediatric primary care providers by integrating interventions into healthcare&#xD;
      settings (9). Unfortunately, primary care visits are often short (average primary visit is&#xD;
      16.4 minutes) and leave little time for addressing obesity in detail, highlighting the need&#xD;
      to also incorporate assessment and treatment in alternative care settings (i.e., emergency&#xD;
      care) (10, 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little research on what role alternative healthcare setting could play in addressing&#xD;
      childhood obesity. The pediatric ED is currently untapped as a setting for obesity screening,&#xD;
      treatment and prevention (12). Yet, childhood obesity has important implications for&#xD;
      emergency medicine and trauma care, and the pediatric ED may be shouldering a&#xD;
      disproportionate burden of this disease compared to other healthcare settings (13, 14). Not&#xD;
      addressing a patient's obesity in the ED setting is a missed opportunity, especially when&#xD;
      many visits are obesity- related (e.g., asthma, type 2 diabetes, fractures), and weight&#xD;
      reduction in specific subgroups could lead to a decrease in future ED utilization. The&#xD;
      pediatric ED may not seem like an ideal location for addressing childhood obesity but many&#xD;
      visits are for non-emergent/urgent conditions and these types of visits provide a window for&#xD;
      screening and intervention (12,15). Families spend a substantial amount of time in the ED&#xD;
      waiting for laboratory/radiology results and disposition. In 2013, the average length of stay&#xD;
      in the Children's EDs was 155 minutes in Minneapolis and 143 minutes in St. Paul, valuable&#xD;
      time that could be used for obesity screening, education, and connection to external&#xD;
      resources. The pediatric ED has the potential to be an important additional healthcare&#xD;
      setting for obesity screening, education, and linkage to external resources, but much more&#xD;
      research is needed (12,13,16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three previous studies have examined obesity rates in the pediatric ED, each finding a higher&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity compared to the general population (12,13,16). Prendergast et al.&#xD;
      conducted a retrospective chart review and found a prevalence of obesity of 29% in a Chicago&#xD;
      pediatric ED, nearly double the national average of 17% (12). The other two studies collected&#xD;
      cross-sectional data from small samples in urban pediatric EDs and found a prevalence of&#xD;
      obesity of 24% (13) and 21.6% (16). Only one study has tested obesity screening in the&#xD;
      pediatric ED (16). Vaughn et al. found that all parents were receptive to obesity screening&#xD;
      and prevention in the ED, regardless of race (16). They also found that only 7.6% of parents&#xD;
      reported that their child's regular physician had counseled them regarding their child's&#xD;
      weight, highlighting the need for obesity screening in additional healthcare settings (16).&#xD;
      These studies indicate that pediatric EDs are seeing a population of patients at high risk&#xD;
      for obesity, many of whom may not be receiving screening or counseling from their regular&#xD;
      physician. Other topics in emergency medicine have received far greater coverage in the&#xD;
      literature, including smoking cessation, injury prevention and substance abuse (13). With the&#xD;
      dramatic increase in pediatric obesity, research on obesity in the pediatric ED is especially&#xD;
      warranted as innovative strategies and collaboration across healthcare settings will be&#xD;
      needed to successfully address this epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the prevalence of obesity in patients who utilize the pediatric ED at Children's&#xD;
      Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota is unknown. Because of time constraints, the height of&#xD;
      patients seen in the pediatric ED are not routinely measured or recorded in the Electronic&#xD;
      Medical Record (EMR). Establishing prevalence of obesity in this population is not possible&#xD;
      without measuring the height of PED patients to determine BMI. Establishing the prevalence in&#xD;
      the population of patients who utilize the pediatric ED will lay the groundwork for future&#xD;
      grant proposals and research in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the prevalence of obesity in the Children's ED patient population?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the association between weight status and ED utilization for injury, asthma and&#xD;
           mental health?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design We will conduct a cross-sectional cohort study of patients aged 2-10 in&#xD;
      Children's ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods ED research assistants will screen the ED log for patients in the 2-10 age range&#xD;
      triaged level 3-5. Research assistants will randomly determine 1 out of 5 patients to&#xD;
      approach for study enrollment. After the consent process is completed, the research assistant&#xD;
      will measure and record the child's height, and ask the parent to complete a short&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

        Patients (aged 2-10) visiting the Children's EDs, who are triaged level 3-5, when a study&#xD;
        RA is on duty will be eligible for the study. We have selected the 2-10 year old patient&#xD;
        population for this study as the early grade school years are a critical time to intervene&#xD;
        before unhealthy lifestyle habits are established, and this age group provides a unique&#xD;
        window of opportunity in which to utilize parent and child interaction.&#xD;
