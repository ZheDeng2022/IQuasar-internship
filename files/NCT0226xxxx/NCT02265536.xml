    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to learn more about how the investigational drug,&#xD;
      LY3022855, affects the immune system in participants with advanced breast or prostate cancer&#xD;
      that has not responded to other treatments. Treatment may last up to 6 cycles (cycle = 6&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  If receiving an antiandrogen as part of first-line hormonal therapy, must have&#xD;
                  shown progression of disease off the antiandrogen prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must be willing to continue androgen deprivation therapy while on study, if no&#xD;
