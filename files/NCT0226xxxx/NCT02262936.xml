  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nocturia, or voiding at night, is an extremely troublesome symptom which is highly prevalent&#xD;
      in the elderly. Desmopressin is a treatment for nocturia but it can result in hyponatremia&#xD;
      (low blood sodium), particularly in those aged 65 and older. Fesoterodine is used for the&#xD;
      treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). Recent trials showed Fesoterodine was effective in&#xD;
      reducing nocturia. This study aims to answer the following: In women 65 and older with severe&#xD;
      nocturia, is Fesoterodine more effective than Desmopressin in reducing the number of night&#xD;
      time voids? Does Fesoterodine have a better side effect profile compared to Desmopressin?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a 12 week randomized double-blinded trial of Fesoterodine and&#xD;
      Desmopressin in the treatment of severe nocturia in women aged 65 and older. This will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Urogynecology Unit at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) and Baycrest. A 3 day&#xD;
      voiding diary and Nocturia, Nocturnal Enuresis and Sleep-interruption Questionnaire (NNES-Q)&#xD;
      will be completed at baseline and at week 12. The primary outcome will be the number of night&#xD;
      time voids in the Fesoterodine group compared to the Desmopressin group, 12 weeks after&#xD;
      starting treatment. Secondary outcomes include changes in the NNES-Q scores and the safety of&#xD;
      each medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to show that, in women 65 and older with severe nocturia, Fesoterodine&#xD;
      will be more effective in reducing the number of night time voids, reducing the volume of&#xD;
      voided urine, increasing the duration of sleep prior to first nocturnal void and improving&#xD;
      quality of life relative to Desmopressin. Fesoterodine will also be better tolerated, with&#xD;
      fewer significant adverse events, relative to Desmopressin.&#xD;

      This study will include female patients 65 years and older from the Urogynecology Units at&#xD;
      Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) and Baycrest. It will be a 12 week prospective, randomized&#xD;
      double-blind trial comparing treatment of nocturia using Fesoterodine and Desmopressin.&#xD;
      Patients who agree to participate in the study will receive a starting dose of either&#xD;
      Fesoterodine 4mg tablet at bedtime or Desmopressin 0.1mg tablet at bedtime. After 4 weeks, if&#xD;
      patients have had minimal improvement in their symptoms and are not significantly affected by&#xD;
      side effects, patients will have the option of increasing the dose of their medication to 8mg&#xD;
      of Fesoterodine or 0.2mg of Desmopressin. This decision will be made by the patient and&#xD;
      physician together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo block randomization by pharmacy. All patients and investigators will be&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment group. Patients will be followed for 12 weeks, with visits at 4 and&#xD;
      12 weeks. Patients will also have urine cultures and uroflowmetry with measurement of&#xD;
      post-void residuals at these visits, as per clinic standard of care. Venipuncture to monitor&#xD;
      electrolyte levels will be done at baseline, 1 week after randomization and then monthly&#xD;
      until the end of the study. If patients choose to increase their dose at the 4 week visit,&#xD;
      electrolyte levels will be repeated one week after the dose adjustment and then monthly until&#xD;
      the end of the study. The last follow up is at 12 weeks, when a 3 day voiding diary and the&#xD;
      NNES-Q will be collected.&#xD;
