  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to collect pilot data to explore whether bilateral deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      (DBS) of the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert (NBM) has beneficial effects on memory and thinking&#xD;
      impairments among individuals with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will perform a pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of human NBM DBS at improving&#xD;
      cognitive deficits in DLB patients. Six patients with DLB with moderate cognitive impairments&#xD;
      (including but not restricted to deficits in attention and working memory) will have&#xD;
      bilateral DBS electrodes implanted to ensure that superficial contacts lie in the motor&#xD;
      Globus Pallidum interna (GPi) target, while the deepest electrical contacts lie in the NBM.&#xD;
      We will place electrodes using our conventional image-guided, stereotactic frame-based&#xD;
      procedure. Once the surgical wounds have healed, patients will be randomised into 2 groups in&#xD;
      a crossover trial design to have 6 week periods of NBM stimulation switched on or switched&#xD;
      off separated by a 2 week washout period, following which the patient will cross over to have&#xD;
      the opposite condition for a further 6 weeks. Outcome measures collected at the 6 weeks and&#xD;
      14 weeks timepoints will be compared according to whether each patient was ON or OFF&#xD;
      stimulation at that timepoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the crossover period, all patients will be invited for continued follow up with&#xD;
      stimulation switched on and will have neuropsychological evaluations at 6 monthly intervals.&#xD;
      Patients will be given the option of receiving additional conventional stimulation to the&#xD;
      motor GPi, through the higher contacts of each electrode, at the end of the crossover period&#xD;
      if required for any coexisting Parkinsonian motor complications of DLB.&#xD;
