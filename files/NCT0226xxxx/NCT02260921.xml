    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score at Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC is a tri-dimensional, disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measure. It consists of 24 questions [each question is presented in a numerical rating scale format with possible values between 0= No (best) to 10= Extreme (worst)] with 5 questions regarding pain [possible subscale score 0 to 50], 2 questions regarding stiffness [possible subscale score 0 to 20] and 17 questions regarding function difficulty [possible subscale score 0 to 170]. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model was used for analyses.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>VAS pain assessment is a measure of pain intensity. The scale is made up of a 10 centimeter (cm) [100 millimeter (mm)] horizontal line. The far left of the horizontal line is labeled &quot;no pain&quot; while the far right of the horizontal line is labeled &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. An ANCOVA model was used for analyses.</description>

It consists of 24 questions [each question is presented in a numerical rating scale format with possible values between 0= No (best) to 10= Extreme (worst)] with 5 questions regarding pain [possible subscale score 0 to 50], 2 questions regarding stiffness [possible subscale score 0 to 20] and 17 questions regarding function difficulty [possible subscale score 0 to 170]. The WOMAC total score was calculated by summing the 3 subscales for a total possible score of 0 to 240. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. An ANCOVA model was used for analyses.</description>

    <measure>WOMAC Pain Score Responder Rate at Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC Pain Score Responder Rate is defined as the percentage of participants with at least a 30% reduction in the WOMAC pain score at Day 30 compared to Baseline. WOMAC is a tri-dimensional, disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measure. It consists of 24 questions [each question is presented in a numerical rating scale format with possible values between 0= No to 10= Extreme] with the first 5 questions regarding pain [possible subscale score 0 (best) to 50 (worst)].</description>

        <description>The WOMAC is a tri-dimensional, disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measure. It consists of 24 questions [each question is presented in a numerical rating scale format with possible values between 0= No (best) to 10= Extreme (worst)] with 5 questions regarding pain [possible subscale score 0 to 50], 2 questions regarding stiffness [possible subscale score 0 to 20] and 17 questions regarding function difficulty [possible subscale score 0 to 170]. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model was used for analyses.</description>

        <description>VAS pain assessment is a measure of pain intensity. The scale is made up of a 10 centimeter (cm) [100 millimeter (mm)] horizontal line. The far left of the horizontal line is labeled &quot;no pain&quot; while the far right of the horizontal line is labeled &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. An ANCOVA model was used for analyses.</description>

        <description>The WOMAC is a tri-dimensional, disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measure. It consists of 24 questions [each question is presented in a numerical rating scale format with possible values between 0= No (best) to 10= Extreme (worst)] with 5 questions regarding pain [possible subscale score 0 to 50], 2 questions regarding stiffness [possible subscale score 0 to 20] and 17 questions regarding function difficulty [possible subscale score 0 to 170]. The WOMAC total score was calculated by summing the 3 subscales for a total possible score of 0 to 240. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. An ANCOVA model was used for analyses.</description>

          <title>VAS Responder Rate at Day 60</title>
          <description>VAS Responder Rate is defined as the percentage of participants with at least a 30% reduction in VAS at Day 60 compared to Baseline. VAS pain assessment is a measure of pain intensity. The scale is made up of a 10 cm (100 mm) horizontal line. The far left of the horizontal line is labeled &quot;no pain&quot; while the far right of the horizontal line is labeled &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;.</description>

        <title>WOMAC Pain Score Responder Rate at Day 60</title>
        <description>WOMAC Pain Score Responder Rate is defined as the percentage of participants with at least a 30% reduction in the WOMAC pain score at Day 60 compared to Baseline. WOMAC is a tri-dimensional, disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measure. It consists of 24 questions [each question is presented in a numerical rating scale format with possible values between 0= No (best) to 10= Extreme (worst)] with the first 5 questions regarding pain [possible subscale score 0 to 50].</description>
