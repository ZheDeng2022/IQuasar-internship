  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving a hypofractionated boost to the primary tumor&#xD;
      before standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II&#xD;
      or III non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Advances in radiation&#xD;
      oncology have allowed better radiation targeting which may be able to send x-rays directly to&#xD;
      the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      cisplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving more precise and&#xD;
      targeted radiation before standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells and prevent the cancer from coming back in the location in which it started.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the primary tumor control rate at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To further establish safety and tolerability of this regimen. II. To estimate the rates of&#xD;
      regional, distant control as well as progression-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) to this regimen. IV. To evaluate the&#xD;
      response of tumors to stereotactic (high-dose) radiation using magnetic resonance tumor&#xD;
      perfusion imaging modalities (magnetic resonance [MR]-dynamic contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      [DCE]/perfusion weighted imaging [PWI], MR-diffusion, blood oxygenation level dependent&#xD;
      [BOLD] sequences).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a hypofractionated boost to the primary tumor over 2 fractions (at&#xD;
      least 40 hours apart) during week 1. Beginning week 2, patients receive cisplatin&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) on days 8, 15, 36, and 43; and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 8-12&#xD;
      and 36-40. If carboplatin and paclitaxel is administered concurrently with radiotherapy, 2&#xD;
      cycles of carboplatin (AUC=6 mg/min/mL IV on day 1, 22) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2 IV on day&#xD;
      1, 22) consolidation chemotherapy are required, to be administered starting 4-6 weeks after&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiation has ended. Each cycle is 21 days long. If cisplatin and etoposide&#xD;
      is administered concurrently with radiotherapy, consolidation chemotherapy is not allowed.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo standard conformal radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week for&#xD;
      a total of 30 fractions. Treatment continues for 6 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

                  to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the&#xD;
                  treatments involved may be significantly immunosuppressive&#xD;
