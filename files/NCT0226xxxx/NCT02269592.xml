  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood cancers occur when the molecules that control normal cell growth are damaged. Many of&#xD;
      these changes can be detected by directly examining parts of the cancer or cells in blood.&#xD;
      Several alterations that occur repeatedly in certain types of blood cancers have already been&#xD;
      identified, and these discoveries have led to the development of new drugs that target those&#xD;
      alterations. More remain to be discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of these abnormalities include alterations in genes. Genes are the part of cells that&#xD;
      contain the instructions which tell the investigators bodies how to grow and work, and&#xD;
      determine physical characteristics such as hair and eye color. Genes are composed of DNA&#xD;
      letters that spell out these instructions. Studies of the DNA molecules that make up the&#xD;
      genes are called &quot;molecular&quot; analyses. Molecular analyses are ways of reading the DNA letters&#xD;
      to identify errors in genes that may contribute to an increased risk of cancer or to the&#xD;
      behavior of the cancer cells. Some changes in genes occur only in cancer cells. Others occur&#xD;
      in the genes that are passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both&#xD;
      kinds of genes. The best way to find these genes is to study large numbers of people. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that as many 1000 individuals will enroll in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is trying to help doctors and scientists understand why cancer occurs and&#xD;
      to develop ways to better treat and prevent it. To participate in this study the participant&#xD;
      must have cancer now, had it in the past, or are at risk of developing cancer. The&#xD;
      participant will not undergo tests or procedures that are not required as part of their&#xD;
      routine clinical care. The investigators will ask the participant to provide an additional&#xD;
      sample from tissue that is obtained for their clinical care including blood, bone marrow, or&#xD;
      tissue sample. The investigators will also ask for a gentle scrape of the inside of their&#xD;
      cheek, mouthwash or a skin sample to obtain their germline DNA&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to perform these molecular analyses on tissues&#xD;
      (obtained from biopsies), blood, or other body fluids such as saliva. Importantly, this study&#xD;
      will use tissue specimens that have already been collected as part of a participant's&#xD;
      clinical care. The participant's tissue sample may be used to create a living tissue sample&#xD;
      (called a &quot;cell line&quot;) that can be grown in the laboratory. This allows researchers to have&#xD;
      an unlimited supply of cells in the future without asking for more samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, analyses will be performed on material only after all necessary clinical tests&#xD;
      have been performed. In general, no additional procedures will be required. However, the&#xD;
      investigators are asking the participant's permission to obtain one additional sample of&#xD;
      blood (a few teaspoons), a gentle swab from the inside of their mouth or a sample of skin to&#xD;
      obtain some cells. These are sources of normal, non-cancer cells which are needed for some&#xD;
      types of analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fully understand the effects that molecular alterations have on blood cancers, they must&#xD;
      be analyzed in the context of clinical behavior. Therefore, this study also asks the&#xD;
      participant's permission to link the molecular alterations in their cancer or leukemia with&#xD;
      clinical information that has been generated during the course of their clinical care. No&#xD;
      additional clinical tests will be required. The investigator will ask to see the participant&#xD;
      for follow up at regular interval to follow their risk of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of participant's specimens as well as some of the material generated during the analysis&#xD;
      of their tissues or blood may be useful for future study. The Investigator's are asking for&#xD;
      the participant's permission to store these specimens and materials in a secure storage&#xD;
      facility for possible later use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, rapid progress in understanding and treating cancer will occur when some of the&#xD;
      molecular information derived from tissue and blood can be shared with other researchers. In&#xD;
      particular, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other organizations have developed&#xD;
      special data (information) repositories that analyze data and collect the results of certain&#xD;
      types of genetic studies. These central banks will store genetic information and samples and&#xD;
      give them to other researchers to do more studies. Therefore, the Investigators are also&#xD;
      asking your permission to share your results with these special banks. The participant's&#xD;
      information will be sent with only a code number attached. The participant's name or other&#xD;
      directly identifiable information will not be given to central banks. There are many&#xD;
      safeguards in place to protect the participant's information and samples while stored in&#xD;
      repositories and used for research. The investigators do not think that there will be further&#xD;
      risks to the participant's privacy and confidentiality by sharing this information with these&#xD;
      banks. However, the investigator's cannot predict how genetic information will be used in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
