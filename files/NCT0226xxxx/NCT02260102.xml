    <textblock>
      Temocillin (6-methoxy-ticarcillin) is a beta-lactam antibiotic with exceptional resistance to&#xD;
      most beta-lactamases. In this context, it is now increasingly used as carbapenem-sparing&#xD;
      antibiotic in patients with suspected infection by Enterobactreriaceae suspected to produce&#xD;
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Little is known about dosing and elimination of temocillin&#xD;
      in children. While available literature of temocillin use in paediatrics refers mainly to its&#xD;
      clinical efficacy in the treatment of urinary tract infections, the drug is also used for the&#xD;
      treatment of suspicion of cholangitis in cirrhotic paediatric patients, and as antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis following an hepatic transplant in children (both off-label indications). There&#xD;
      is, therefore, a pressing need to explore the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      temocillin in the paediatric population, in order to provide clear guidance on an appropriate&#xD;
      dosing regimen. The study objectives are: (1) characterisation of the pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      of temocillin in 3 paediatric populations, (2) proposal and development of a dosing schedule&#xD;
      that can ensure therapeutic concentrations (40% ƒT &gt; MIC) and optimize treatment chances of&#xD;
      success, and (3) characterization of MICs of microbiological strains (when available) to&#xD;
      temocillin.&#xD;

      1. Introduction Temocillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic active against Gram-negative bacteria.&#xD;
      Its spectrum covers family members of the Enterobacteriaceae (including many of those&#xD;
      producing beta-lactamases), Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria spp 1,2, but not&#xD;
      Pseudomonas. It is currently licensed for use in septicemia, urinary tract infection (UTIs),&#xD;
      and lower respiratory tract infection.3 There is also evidence of its clinical efficacy in&#xD;
      the treatment of biliary tract infections in adults.4,5 Temocillin biliary levels can be&#xD;
      several times-fold superior to serum concentrations in patients with cholelithiasis, although&#xD;
      they can also be characterised by high interindividual variation.6,7 In addition, its&#xD;
      prolonged half-life (4.5-5 hours) and its Gram-negative spectrum make temocillin particularly&#xD;
      suited for the treatment of hepatobiliary infections.5 One study documents the efficacy of&#xD;
      temocillin in this indication (16 patients with biliary tract infections; daily dose of 2g of&#xD;
      temocillin).7&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of this molecule has been greatly enhanced in the recent years due to the&#xD;
      increased incidence of infections caused by organisms producing extended-spectrum&#xD;
      beta-lactamases (ESBL), making it to become a sparing-drug for carbapenems.8-10 Temocillin&#xD;
      presents MICs ranging from 2 to 32 mg/L against Enterobacteriaceae, including most ESBL&#xD;
      producers.1,2 Like all beta-lactam antibiotics, the time above MIC for free drug&#xD;
      concentrations (ƒT&gt;MIC) is the important PK-PD parameter correlating with its efficacy.11&#xD;
      When the beta-lactam antibiotic concentrations do not exceed the MIC for 40% to 50% of the&#xD;
      dosing interval, the efficacy of a beta-lactam antibiotic can be compromised. When a cut-off&#xD;
      of a ƒT&gt;MIC of 40% is used, a Monte-Carlo simulation of the available data defines a clinical&#xD;
      PK/PD breakpoint of 8 to 16 mg/L for temocillin.11-13 The available temocillin&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics data (distribution, metabolism, and elimination) comes from studies&#xD;
      performed in adults. It is mainly excreted unchanged (80%) in the urine by glomerular&#xD;
      filtration and tubular secretion.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about dosing and elimination of temocillin in children. The summary of&#xD;
      product characteristics of temocillin proposes a daily dose of 25 - 50 mg/kg for paediatric&#xD;
      use,14 but there are no studies that back-up this recommendation. This dose probably arises&#xD;
      from scaling-down the typical adult daily dose of 2-4 g assuming an adult weight of 70kg. In&#xD;
      the literature, the use of temocillin in paediatrics refers mainly to its clinical efficacy&#xD;
      in the treatment of urinary tract infections.15,16 In the present hospital, temocillin is&#xD;
      also used for the treatment of suspicion of cholangitis in cirrhotic paediatric patients, and&#xD;
      as antibiotic prophylaxis following an hepatic transplant in children (both off-label&#xD;
      indications). There is, therefore, a pressing need to explore the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of temocillin in the paediatric population, in order to provide clear&#xD;
      guidance on an appropriate dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterisation of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of temocillin (total and free&#xD;
           concentrations) in 3 paediatric populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. children requiring antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infections&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. cirrhotic children requiring antibiotic treatment due to suspicion of cholangitis&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. children requiring antibiotic prophylaxis following an hepatic transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proposal and development of a dosing schedule that can ensure therapeutic concentrations&#xD;
           (40% ƒT &gt; MIC) and optimize treatment chances of success.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characterization of MICs of microbiological strains (when available) to temocillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Criteria for patients' selection 3.1 Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Male or female patient requiring temocillin&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. for the treatment of urinary tract infections, or&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. as antibiotic prophylaxis following an hepatic transplant. 2. Requirement of&#xD;
           hospitalization (not for social or other non-medical reasons) for at least up to 5 days&#xD;
           3. Patients aged 6 months - 3 years at the beginning of the treatment with temocillin 4.&#xD;
           Parents or legal representatives able to give written informed consent in accordance&#xD;
           with GCP and local regulatory requirements, prior to any study procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Ig-E mediated allergy to penicillins&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Previous treatment with temocillin for the current cholangitis episode&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Diagnosis of Alagille syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Estimated life-expectance of &lt; 5 days due to major co-morbid conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Other serious illnesses, e.g. HIV, serious infections requiring other antibiotics,&#xD;
                malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Patients with acute or chronic renal failure (eGFR &lt; 30ml/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Patients having participated in another study &lt; 30 days before inclusion in the&#xD;
                present study&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Investigational Plan 4.1 Study design and plan This is a prospective, open,&#xD;
           non-interventional and monocentric study that will take place at the &quot;Service de&#xD;
           Gastro-entérologie pédiatrique&quot; of the &quot;Cliniques Universitaires St-Luc&quot; in Brussels,&#xD;
           Belgium. All patients eligible for treatment with temocillin will be evaluated and&#xD;
           considered for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For each of the 3 paediatric populations, a total of 10-15 patients eligible for&#xD;
           participation will be included in the study. According to the manufacturer's&#xD;
           information14 a dose of 25mg/kg (in cases of prophylaxis) or 50mg/kg (in cases of&#xD;
           treatment) every 12 hours will be used and administered by IV route. Blood samples will&#xD;
           be drawn on day 1 and day 4 of treatment at 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 12 hours after dose&#xD;
           administration. The patient's physician will decide on the duration of temocillin use.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The expected total duration of the trial is 1 year (or more if patient enrollment is&#xD;
           slow; number of patients to be included: 10-15 for each of the 3 paediatric&#xD;
           populations).&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Study procedures All blood samples (3mL each) will be taken from an arterial or&#xD;
           venous catheter and collected in additive-free blood tubes. After blood clotting, they&#xD;
           will be centrifuged and the serum will be frozen (-80°C) until analysis. Total&#xD;
           concentration and free concentration will be determined by a validated High Pressure&#xD;
           Liquid chromatography-Ultra Violet detection (HPLC-UV) method.12,17&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, the following parameters will be recorded during study period: time of&#xD;
           temocillin administration, patient's weight, renal and liver function markers (including&#xD;
           total serum protein), infection markers, concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
           The temocillin concentrations versus time data in serum will be analysed using a&#xD;
           non-linear mixed effects modeling approach using a Nonlinear Mixed-Effects Modelling&#xD;
           software (NONMEM version 7.3; ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD). The&#xD;
           population pharmacokinetic model will then be defined, and used to simulated different&#xD;
           dosing regimens with Monte Carlo simulations, that will be used for calculating the&#xD;
           probability of target attainment (40% ƒT&gt;MIC) for free concentration by MIC. Statistical&#xD;
           significance is defined as P value of &lt; 0.05. JMP version 11 software (SAS Institute,&#xD;
           Cary, NC, USA) will be used for statistical analysis. If the clinical isolates for each&#xD;
           patient are not available, the MIC distributions of the hospital will be considered for&#xD;
           data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. Administrative Matters The trial will be carried out in compliance with the protocol,&#xD;
           the principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the&#xD;
           International Committee on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good&#xD;
           Clinical Practice (GCP) and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1 Institutional Review Board / Independent Ethics Committee The trial will not be&#xD;
           initiated before the protocol and informed consent and subject information form have&#xD;
           been reviewed and received approval / favourable opinion from the local Institutional&#xD;
           Review Board (IRB) or an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2 Informed Consent and Subject Information Prior to subject participation in the&#xD;
           trial, written informed consent will be obtained from each subject's legally accepted&#xD;
           representative according to the regulatory and legal requirements. Each signature must&#xD;
           be dated by each signatory and the informed consent and any additional subject&#xD;
           information form retained by the investigator as part of the study records. A signed&#xD;
           copy of the informed consent and any additional subject information must be given to the&#xD;
           subject's legally authorised representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. Timeframe: Outcome measure will be assessed within a maximum of 18 months.&#xD;
