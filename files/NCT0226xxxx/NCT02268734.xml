      Vandetanib has been approved for patients with unresectable and/or metastatic medullary&#xD;
      thyroid cancer (MTC) by the Food and Drug Administration, by the European Medicines Agency&#xD;
      and, very recently, it has been licensed also by the Italian Regulatory Agency (AIFA) for the&#xD;
      use in Italy. Vandetanib is an orally tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and RET signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating microRNAs levels could be influenced by the treatment procedures and we&#xD;
      hypothesize that a TKI therapy could influence the levels of circulating miRNAs as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this project is to seek non-invasive molecular markers potentially useful as&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is considered worldwide a rare cancer. It derives from the&#xD;
      parafolicular C-cells representing about 5-10% of all thyroid cancer. MTC is diagnosed as&#xD;
      sporadic form (sMTC) in most of the patients, although in 20-30% of cases it could be&#xD;
      hereditary and transmitted as an autosomal-dominant trait due to the germline mutations of&#xD;
      the RET proto-oncogene. RET tyrosine kinase receptor is involved in the regulation of&#xD;
      differentiation, proliferation, survival and cell motility processes through several&#xD;
      intracellular signalling pathways, including MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vandetanib has been approved for patients with unresectable and/or metastatic MTC by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration, by the European Medicines Agency and, very recently, it has been&#xD;
      licensed also by the Italian Regulatory Agency (AIFA) for the use in Italy. Vandetanib is an&#xD;
      orally tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and RET signaling. In a randomized phase&#xD;
      III trial, response rate to vandetanib ranged from 31% to 55% with a predicted median&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) of 30.5 months while data on overall survival were still not&#xD;
      available at the time of publication. These results suggest that approximately half of the&#xD;
      patients could benefit from this compound whose activity is in every case limited in the&#xD;
      time. Activity of vandetanib seems to be influenced by several factors, including RET&#xD;
      mutational status and tumor genetic heterogeneity (clonal versus non-clonal RET mutation&#xD;
      distribution). Recent analyses of circulating miRNAs in tumor patients have suggested that&#xD;
      miRNA signatures may be useful as diagnostic/prognostic/predictive as well as pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      markers for several tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No clinical neither biological data are currently available to identify which patients could&#xD;
      really get a benefit from a TKI. In other words, some metastatic patients could suffer from&#xD;
      an indolent disease, not requiring a TKI upfront and up to date, we are still not able to&#xD;
      identify this selected group of patients Circulating miRNAs levels could be influenced by the&#xD;
      treatment procedures, as it has been described in lung cancer where miR-21 and miR-24&#xD;
      resulted significantly lower in the post-operative period respect to the pre-operative one in&#xD;
      paired samples. We hypothesize that a TKI therapy could influence the levels of circulating&#xD;
      miRNAs as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this project is to seek non-invasive molecular markers potentially useful as&#xD;
      prognostic tools for metastatic MTC patients.&#xD;
