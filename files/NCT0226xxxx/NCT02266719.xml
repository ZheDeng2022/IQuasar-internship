  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical outcomes and radiation of the use of&#xD;
      off-the-shelf and custom-made devices (CMDs) for the endovascular repair of juxtarenal,&#xD;
      suprarenal, thoracoabdominal and arch aortic aneurysms in patients having appropriate&#xD;
      anatomy. The study consists of three cohorts. The first 2 cohorts are the continuation of the&#xD;
      current IDE study. The first cohort is aimed to assess the use of custom-made devices (CMDs)&#xD;
      for the endovascular repair of juxtarenal, suprarenal and type IV thoracoabdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysms in standard and high-risk patients having appropriate anatomy (Fenestrated-CMD&#xD;
      cohort). The second cohort (Type I-III thoracoabdominal cohort) includes standard and&#xD;
      high-risk patients with type I- III thoracoabdominal aneurysms that require the use of&#xD;
      branched/fenestrated CMDs, or, in selected cases, the Zenith Thoracoabdominal Branch (Zenith®&#xD;
      t-Branch™) device. Finally, the third cohort (the Arch cohort) will include 10 high-risk&#xD;
      patients with aortic arch aneurysms treated by patient-specific stent-grafts with one to&#xD;
      three inner branches or a scallop.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single center, non-randomized, triple-cohort study. For the&#xD;
      Fenestrated-CMD cohort a total of 250 patients will be enrolled. For the type I-III&#xD;
      thoracoabdominal cohort, a total of 200 patients will be enrolled. For the Arch cohort, 10&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled. CMDs will be used primarily. Off-the-shelf devices will be used in&#xD;
      urgent cases and when the waiting period for design and manufacturing of a CMD may not be&#xD;
      considered acceptable. Staged endovascular repair will be used for type I, II and III TAAAs&#xD;
      and for concurrent arch and TAAAs, unless the condition of the patient requires a single&#xD;
      stage endovascular repair. A separate subgroup analysis of patients undergoing procedures&#xD;
      with off-the-shelf devices will be performed.&#xD;

        true:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &lt;18 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Life expectancy &lt;2 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning on becoming pregnant within 60 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Inability or refusal to give informed consent by the patient or a legally authorized&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Prior surgical or interventional procedure within 30 days of the anticipated date of&#xD;
             the fenestrated procedure, with the exception of planned staged procedures to provide&#xD;
             access for repair (e.g. staged iliac conduit, thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm&#xD;
             repair for proximal aneurysms, elephant trunk repair), to facilitate the procedure by&#xD;
             allowing open reparation of a target artery not amenable to revascularization with the&#xD;
             investigational device, such us an internal iliac artery, subclavian artery or&#xD;
             visceral artery with early bifurcation, tortuosity or occlusive disease preventing&#xD;
             successful placement and alignment side stents, or to treat proximal aortic aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participation in another clinical or device trial, with the exception of observational&#xD;
             studies, participation in another investigational endovascular endograft protocol,&#xD;
             percutaneous aortic valve protocol, or concomitant clinical trials designed to&#xD;
             evaluate medical therapy strategies to reduce perioperative risk during&#xD;
             fenestrated-branched endovascular repair, including risks of renal dysfunction,&#xD;
             contrast-induced nephropathy, neurologic, spinal cord or cardiac complications, and/or&#xD;
             use of advanced imaging to reduce radiation exposure during implantation of these&#xD;
             devices. Participation in investigational device trials not encompassed by the IDE&#xD;

             peri-operative outcomes or to reduce radiation exposure of fenestrated/branched&#xD;
             endografts may be concurrent with the IDE study. Examples include therapy directed to&#xD;
             reduce rates of spinal cord injury, stroke and contrast-induced nephropathy associated&#xD;
             with implantation of fenestrated-branched stent-grafts or advanced imaging trials&#xD;
             designed to reduce radiation exposure during repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with ruptured aortic aneurysm requiring urgent or emergent repair, with the&#xD;

             according to proposed instructions for use of these devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be excluded from the study if any of the following conditions are true:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known sensitivities or allergies to stainless steel, nitinol, polyester, solder (tin,&#xD;
             silver), polypropylene, urethane or gold&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of anaphylactic reaction to contrast material that cannot be adequately&#xD;
             pre-medicated&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Mycotic aneurysm or patients with evidence of active systemic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of connective tissue disorder (e.g. vascular Ehlers Danlos, Marfan syndrome),&#xD;
             with the exception of those patients who had prior open surgical aortic replacement or&#xD;
             endovascular repair, where a surgical graft or an endograft would serve as landing&#xD;
             zone for the investigational endograft, those who are deemed prohibitive risk for open&#xD;
             repair or connective tissue disorders with no vascular effects (e.g. non-vascular&#xD;
             types of Ehlers Danlos).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Body habitus that would inhibit x-ray visualization of the aorta and its branches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Anatomical Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must be excluded from the study if any of the following is true:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Inadequate femoral or iliac access compatible with the requirements of the required&#xD;
             delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to perform a temporary or permanent open surgical or endovascular iliac&#xD;
             conduit for patients with inadequate femoral/iliac access.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Absence of a landing aortic segment in the distal thoracic aorta above the&#xD;
             diaphragmatic hiatus with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A diameter measured outer to the outer wall greater than 42 mm or less than 19&#xD;
                  mm;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Parallel aortic wall with &gt;20% diameter change and with significant calcification&#xD;
                  and/or thrombus in the selected area of the seal zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Visceral anatomy not compatible with the investigational device due to excessive&#xD;
             occlusive disease or small size not amenable to stent graft placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Unsuitable distal iliac arterial fixation site and anatomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Common iliac artery fixation site diameter measured outer wall to outer wall on a&#xD;
                  section image (CT)&lt; 8.0 mm with inability to perform surgical conduit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Iliac artery diameter measured outer wall to outer wall on a sectional image (CT)&#xD;
                  &gt; 21 mm at distal fixation site, with inability to perform open internal iliac&#xD;
                  artery revascularization or iliac branch stent graft or custom iliac extension&#xD;
                  with fenestration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Iliac artery distal fixation site &lt;10 mm in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Inability to preserve at least one hypogastric artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For patients in the type I-III TAAA cohort, the intended use criteria are the same for both&#xD;
        the fenestrated/branched CMD vs the off-the-shelf device. The CMD will preferably be used,&#xD;
        unless an urgent repair is indicated or the waiting period for design or manufacturing of&#xD;
        the CMD is considered unacceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional anatomical inclusion criteria for aortic arch devices&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Proximal aortic fixation zone:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Native aorta or surgical graft&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Diameter: 20-42mm&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Proximal neck length ≥ 20mm&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Ascending aortic length ≥50mm&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Must occur distal to coronary arteries and any coronary artery bypass grafts that&#xD;
                  are considered patent and necessary for proper cardiac perfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Distal aortic fixation zone:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Native aorta or surgical graft&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Diameter: 20-42mm&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Distal neck length ≥20mm&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Distal fixation will be obtained with stent-grafts in a staged repair&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Supra-aortic trunk (brachiocephalic) vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The arch branch device will typically have two or three branches with additional&#xD;
                  modifications to the design that allows for a single branch or combination of&#xD;
                  branch and scallop if a customized version is required. An extra-anatomic bypass&#xD;
                  graft may be done in conjunction (or in a staged fashion) with the procedure, as&#xD;
                  required. For the two-branch design, the vessels most commonly incorporated will&#xD;
                  be the innominate artery and left common carotid artery. However, the innominate&#xD;
                  artery may be coupled with the left subclavian artery in the setting of a bovine&#xD;
                  arch whereby the flow to the left carotid would come from a left subclavian to&#xD;
                  carotid bypass. Similarly, the left carotid and subclavian artery may be&#xD;
                  branched, or simply one vessel branched should specific anatomic limitations&#xD;
                  exist. In such a situation, multiple extra-anatomic bypasses may be necessary. A&#xD;
                  design with a single subclavian retrograde branch and scallop to the left carotid&#xD;
                  artery may be used to extent the landing zone to Zone 1. Finally, a design with&#xD;
                  two antegrade inner branches for the innominate and left common carotid, and one&#xD;
                  retrograde inner branch for the left subclavian artery may be used in select&#xD;
                  cases. Thus, the inclusion criteria are defined for each artery, yet any&#xD;
                  combination of arteries may be used for a repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Innominate artery&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Native vessel or surgical graft 2. Diameter: 8-22mm 3. Length of sealing zone ≥10mm 4.&#xD;
        Acceptable tortuosity ii. Left (or right) common carotid artery&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Native vessel or surgical graft&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diameter 6-16mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Length of sealing zone ≥10mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Acceptable tortuosity iii. Left (or right) subclavian artery&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Native vessel or surgical graft 2. Diameter: 5-20mm 3. Length of sealing zone ≥10mm 4.&#xD;
        Acceptable tortuosity 4. In the setting of an aortic dissection the following criteria must&#xD;
        exist:&#xD;
&#xD;
        a. Access into the true lumen from the groin and at least one supra-aortic trunk vessel b.&#xD;
        A sealing zone in the target aorta (or surgical graft) that is proximal to the primary&#xD;
        dissection, such that a stent-graft would be anticipated to seal off the dissection lumen&#xD;
        c. A sealing zone in the target supra-aortic trunk vessels that is distal to the&#xD;
        dissection, anticipated to seal off the dissection lumen, or surgically created d. A true&#xD;
        lumen size large enough to deploy the device and still gain access into the target branches&#xD;
        5. In the setting of more distal disease, the repair may be coupled with a thoracoabdominal&#xD;
        branched device, infrarenal device, and/or internal iliac branch device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Iliac anatomy must allow for the delivery of the arch branch device which is loaded&#xD;
        within a 20F-24F sheath. Conduits to the iliac vessels or aorta may be used if deemed&#xD;
        necessary.&#xD;
