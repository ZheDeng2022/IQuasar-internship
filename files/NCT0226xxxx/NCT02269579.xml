                  hematologic disorder (myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS], myeloproliferative disease&#xD;
                  [MPD]or history of cytotoxic treatment for non-hematologic malignancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with relapsed/refractory AML regardless of cytogenetic risk&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with relapsed/refractory ALL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with MDS (IPSS score ≥ 1.5)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values fulfilling the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Serum alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &lt; 3 times the ULN.&#xD;
                  Note:If elevated liver enzymes are related to disease; contact medical monitor to&#xD;
                  discuss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac ejection fraction ≥50% by ECHO or MUGA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with second malignancies in remission may be eligible if there is clinical&#xD;
             evidence of disease stability for a period of greater than 6 months off cytotoxic&#xD;
             chemotherapy, documented by imaging, tumor marker studies, etc., at screening.&#xD;
             Patients maintained on long-term nonchemotherapy treatment, e.g., hormonal therapy,&#xD;
             are eligible.&#xD;

             cardiomyopathy,ischemic heart disease, significant valvular dysfunction, hypertensive&#xD;
             heart disease, and congestive heart failure) resulting in heart failure by New York&#xD;
             Heart Association Criteria (Class III or IV staging)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed patients with Acute promyelocytic leukemia [t(15;17)] or favorable&#xD;
             cytogenetics, including t(8;21) or inv16&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of active CNS leukemic involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy or other investigational anticancer therapeutic drugs within 1 week prior&#xD;
             to study entry. AEs from prior therapy must have resolved or stabilized so that there&#xD;
             is no interference with the assessment of efficacy or safety; in the event of rapidly&#xD;
             proliferative disease, however, the use of hydroxyurea is permitted up to 12 hours&#xD;
             before study entry. Patients with prior bone marrow or stem cell transplant,&#xD;
             considered for inclusion, should be discussed with the medical monitor first.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious medical condition or psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient&#xD;
             from providing informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior cumulative anthracycline exposure of greater than 368 mg/m2&#xD;
             daunorubicin (or equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or uncontrolled infection. Patients with any infection receiving treatment&#xD;
             (antibiotic,antifungal or antiviral treatment) may be entered into the study but must&#xD;
             be afebrile and hemodynamically stable for ≥72 hrs. Patients with fevers believed to&#xD;
             be due to leukemia or MDS are eligible provided a thorough infection work-up is&#xD;
             negative and the patient is clinically and hemodynamically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to cytarabine, daunorubicin or liposomal products&#xD;
