  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK. Surgical resection is the&#xD;
      mainstay of curative therapy. With the screening program enabling early detection, surgery&#xD;
      plays an important role in treatment strategies. Surgery imparts a significant physiological&#xD;
      and psychological stress on cancer patients.Recent research has demonstrated that a&#xD;
      fast-track approach utilising regional anaesthesia, early mobilisation and good oral intake&#xD;
      can improve outcomes by reducing the physiological stress response to surgery. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine whether a defined exercise programme can improve&#xD;
      recovery and reduce complications after surgery.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective and randomised pilot clinical trial. For purposes of pragmatism,&#xD;
      subjects and investigators will not be blinded to treatment allocation. The study is not&#xD;
      blinded because it is impossible to blind investigators or patients to the exercise&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing major resectional surgery for colorectal cancer will be recruited from&#xD;
      the Academic Surgical unit (ASU), Castle Hill Hospital. In total, 60 participants will be&#xD;
      recruited for this pilot study and randomly allocated into 2 groups as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will necessitate all participants being involved in a baseline assessment which&#xD;
      will take on average 60 minutes with patients attending Castle Hill Hospital. Travel costs&#xD;
      will be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked for a 15 ml blood samples on entry into the study and at 24-48&#xD;
      hrs prior to surgery. Regardless of recruitment, blood samples are necessary for clinical&#xD;
      purposes at these stages in all patients as part of routine preoperative assessment prior to&#xD;
      colorectal surgery. The aim of this is to permit an analysis of possible changes in&#xD;
      antioxidant status prior to surgery but after preconditioning. This would be in addition to&#xD;
      routine blood samples required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups in this study are described in more detail below. Both groups shall receive&#xD;
      the same standard care as is normal for patients undergoing colorectal resection surgery. The&#xD;
      only difference between groups shall be the addition of exercise preconditioning sessions to&#xD;
      group 1. We anticipate that these will be three times a week and lasting of 60-90 minutes&#xD;
      duration each. Travel costs will be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 60 patients in this study will be randomised to one of two groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 - Standard care + Exercise intervention. Patients in this group will participate&#xD;
           in a 2-4 week low volume, moderate intensity, supervised, one to one, individualised&#xD;
           exercise programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - Standard care (Control) group. These patients will not be entered into a&#xD;
           supervised exercise programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0 - A two to four week period of low to moderate intensity exercise prior to surgery using&#xD;
      an individualised exercise intervention will not reduce post-surgical length of hospital stay&#xD;
      in colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1- A two to four week period of low to moderate intensity exercise prior to surgery using an&#xD;
      individualised exercise intervention will reduce post-surgical length of hospital stay in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0 - A two to four week period of low to moderate intensity exercise prior to surgery using&#xD;
      an individualised exercise intervention will not modify the body's defence systems against a&#xD;
      future oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1- A two to four week period of low to moderate intensity exercise prior to surgery using an&#xD;
      individualised exercise intervention will modify the body's defence systems against a future&#xD;
      oxidative stress.&#xD;
