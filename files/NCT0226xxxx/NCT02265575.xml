  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the leading health issues among patients, particularly children, presenting for care&#xD;
      in low- and middle-income countries is dehydration. When oral rehydration is not sufficient&#xD;
      or is clinically inappropriate, rehydration often occurs intravenously. An alternative to&#xD;
      intravenous rehydration is subcutaneous infusion and - with or without hyaluronidase enzyme&#xD;
      (or Hylenex) - has been shown in several robust trials in high-income countries to be as&#xD;
      effective and even safer than intravenous infusion. In this study in western Kenya, the&#xD;
      investigators propose a first-ever randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether&#xD;
      hyaluronidase-facilitated subcutaneous infusion can be as effective and safe as IV therapy&#xD;
      among moderate-to-severely dehydrated patients in low- and middle-income countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous (SC) infusion has been established in high-income countries as a safe and&#xD;
      effective alternative to expedite and simplify IV access. , A study from 2003 demonstrated&#xD;
      the efficacy of SC hydration in elderly patients, for example. Fluid absorption via the SC&#xD;
      method was almost identical to that via the IV method. A recent retrospective study compared&#xD;
      SC fluid infusion with IV fluid infusion in children and showed that the SC method makes&#xD;
      possible a more timely delivery of parenteral fluid with fewer needlesticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, SC hydration has been shown to be even more effective with the addition of&#xD;
      recombinant human hyaluronidase, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid that makes up the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix. , (Note: Hyaluronidase, or Hylenex, is not an investigational drug; it&#xD;
      is FDA-approved, regularly used in the U.S., and will be procured for this study through the&#xD;
      pharmacy of the Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA).) When hyaluronidase is injected&#xD;
      subcutaneously, an area forms where fluids do not have a dense matrix to cross. Flow rates&#xD;
      with hyaluronidase-assisted SC (hSC) infusion are nearly five times faster than SC fluid&#xD;
      administration alone.8 U.S.-based studies comparing hSC rehydration with standard IV&#xD;
      rehydration in children with mild-to-moderate dehydration have demonstrated several benefits&#xD;
      of hSC, including time and success of line placement, ease of use, satisfaction, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness.9, These studies concluded that hSC hydration is a reasonable alternative&#xD;
      to IV hydration in resource-rich settings, especially for children with difficult IV access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While hSC infusion has been shown to be safe, successful, and cost-effective in high-income&#xD;
      countries like the United States, there have been no randomized control trials in&#xD;
      low-resource settings. The benefits of hSC that have been demonstrated in high-income&#xD;
      countries, namely the ease of use and cost-effectiveness, may be particularly advantageous in&#xD;
      low- and middle-income countries. It may even be found to be safer in these settings than&#xD;
      current standards of care in light of recent findings of higher mortality with IV bolus&#xD;
      rehydration among febrile children with infection in Africa. We, therefore, propose a&#xD;
      feasibility study to evaluate whether hSC infusion can be effective and safe among&#xD;
      moderate-to-severely dehydrated patients in rural community hospitals in western Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      hSC infusion can improve clinical management of patients presenting with moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      dehydration. It can serve as a definitive alternative rehydration method or as a bridge to IV&#xD;
      access when IV access is unobtainable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyaluronidase-assisted subcutaneous fluid resuscitation is equally effective as standard IV&#xD;
      therapy for initial volume resuscitation in moderate to severely dehydrated patients in rural&#xD;
      Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyaluronidase-assisted subcutaneous fluid resuscitation can decrease costs, shorten time to&#xD;
      IV placement (reduce needlesticks), less discomfort, and decrease complications compared to&#xD;
      standard IV therapy in moderate to severely dehydrated patients in rural Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to help answer the following research questions: Can hSC be effectively&#xD;
      introduced among mid-level providers in rural community hospitals in western Kenya? Can hSC&#xD;
      serve as an effective and safe treatment or bridge to IV access among patients presenting&#xD;
      with moderate-to-severe dehydration? What are the perceptions and attitudes of providers and&#xD;
      patients upon the use of hSC? What is the cost effectiveness of hSC in this setting?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of hyaluronidase-assisted subcutaneous resuscitation (hSC) in&#xD;
      moderate to severely dehydrated patients in Kenya.&#xD;
