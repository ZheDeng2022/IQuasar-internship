    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential benefit of enhancing total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA) surgery using some of your own cells taken from fat tissue that may be&#xD;
      able to help recovery and repair of knee tissues.&#xD;

      Your participation in this study will require that you allow the surgical team to use a fat&#xD;
      pad in your knee that is usually discarded during surgery to harvest regenerative cells. The&#xD;
      fat pad will be processed using the Transpose RTTM system (InGeneron, Inc., Houston, TX, USA)&#xD;
      to produce adipose-derived regenerative cells. These cells will be re-injected in your knee&#xD;
      during the surgery. These cells may encourage healing at the surgical site, although whether&#xD;
      or how much they encourage healing is unknown. Determining whether such improved healing&#xD;
      occurs is the purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have the infrapatellar fat pad removed as part of the normal total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty surgery. Some patients will have the fat pad processed and cells inserted back&#xD;
      in their knee. Other patients will have saline inserted into the knee in the same manner as&#xD;
      the fat pad cells. To which group of patients/participants you would be assigned is&#xD;
      determined by a random process, similar to flipping a coin. The surgery is the same in all&#xD;
      other ways for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation will require that you attend your regularly scheduled postoperative&#xD;
      visits. You will not have to make any extra clinic visits for this study. After you leave the&#xD;
      hospital, you will be asked to rate your pain daily until you return for your first&#xD;
      postoperative visit at 7-10 days. At your postoperative visits at 7-10 days, 1 month and 3&#xD;
      months, you will be asked to fill out a short questionnaire and your knee swelling, range of&#xD;
      motion and function will be evaluated by Dr. Burke. Your participation in this study would&#xD;
      also allow the investigator (Dr. Burke) to use certain information from your medical records,&#xD;
      although your name or identity will not be revealed publicly in any resulting report or&#xD;
      summary of the study.&#xD;
