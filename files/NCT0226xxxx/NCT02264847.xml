  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In women being treated with medicines to help eggs to grow (called ovulation induction), The&#xD;
      investigators wish to know whether adding medicines (called ovulation triggers) that help to&#xD;
      release the egg (ovulation) would lead to more women having babies without causing harm&#xD;
      compared with not giving them ovulation triggers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women will be treated with clomiphene citrate to help eggs to develop to additionally receive&#xD;
      a medicine (urinary hCG) to trigger their release or to receive no additional treatment. the&#xD;
      investigators tried to determine the benefits and harms of administering an ovulation trigger&#xD;
      to anovulatory women receiving treatment with ovulation-inducing agents in comparison with&#xD;
      spontaneous ovulation following ovulation induction. so we will have comparison between 2&#xD;
      groups, group 1 will receive clomiphene citrate and trigger ovulation by human chorionic&#xD;
      gonadotrophin and group 2 will receive clomiphene citrate with no drug to trigger ovulation.&#xD;

    <description>Women will receive clomiphene citrate from day 2 to day 6 of the cycle with a starting dose of 100 mg daily. If no response could be observed, the daily dose of clomiphene citrate in subsequent cycles will be increased by 50 mg until a response will be obtained or a maximum daily dose 200 mg of clomiphene citrate will be used. Once a follicle will reach more than 18 mm in size . Women will receive 5,000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin trigger in the morning between 9 and 10 a.m. and the couple will be advised to have intercourse the following night, about 36 hours later.</description>
