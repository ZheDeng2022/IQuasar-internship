  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the initial exploration of pegcetacoplan in patients with PNH. The&#xD;
      assessments of the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD following administration of single and&#xD;
      multiples doses of pegcetacoplan will guide decisions to further develop the drug.&#xD;

    <description>TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed or worsened after first dose of study drug (Day 1), and up to 30 days after last dose of study drug. The Investigator assessed AEs for severity and relatedness to study drug. AEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v4.03) based on: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life-threatening; Grade 5: Death related to AE.</description>

    <description>Assessment of Ctrough,max of pegcetacoplan over the multiple dosing phase, estimated using a non-compartmental approach. Pegcetacoplan PK parameters were summarized for Cohort 4 only. Ctrough,max was calculated for both 270 mg/day and 360 mg/day where subjects received both doses. Note: 1 subject in Cohort 4 who was receiving 360 mg/day was granted Sponsor and institutional review board approval to increase the dose further to the equivalent of 440 mg/day and Ctrough,max is also reported for this dose.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) subjects who were still anemic during treatment with eculizumab (Soliris®) were enrolled in this Phase 1, open-label, single- and multiple-ascending dose study to receive treatment with pegcetacoplan (APL-2) as an add-on to standard of care treatment. The study was conducted at 7 sites in the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects could participate in more than 1 cohort. Overall, 9 unique subjects were evaluated in 4 cohorts, with some subjects participating in &gt;1 cohort. Single-dose phase: 4 unique subjects evaluated (2 each in Cohorts 1 and 2). Multiple-dose phase: 8 unique subjects evaluated, comprising 3 subjects who also participated in single-dose phase (1 in Cohort 1; 2 in Cohort 2) plus a further 5 unique subjects. Each cohort included a 30-day screening phase prior to treatment with pegcetacoplan.</pre_assignment_details>

Cohort 4 multiple-dose phase: Subjects received 270 mg/day SC doses of pegcetacoplan for up to 729 days (from Day 1 up to Day 729). The treatment period consisted of the following:&#xD;

Part 2A: On Day 29, subjects who demonstrated clinical benefit from the treatment were automatically entered into Part 2A and continued to receive daily doses of pegcetacoplan until Day 84.&#xD;
Part 2B: If there was ongoing evidence of clinical benefit, subjects who completed Part 2A could enter Part 2B and continue to receive daily doses of pegcetacoplan until Day 364.&#xD;
Part 2C: If there was ongoing evidence of clinical benefit, subjects who completed Part 2B could enter Part 2C and continue to receive daily doses of pegcetacoplan until Day 729.&#xD;
After Day 28 (Part 1), individual subject dose escalation up to a dose of 360 mg/day could occur in subjects who had a sub-optimal hematological response but acceptable tolerability.</description>

        <description>Assessment of AUC0-t of pegcetacoplan over the multiple dosing phase, estimated using a non-compartmental approach and calculated by the linear-log trapezoidal method. Pegcetacoplan pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were summarized for Cohort 4 only.</description>
