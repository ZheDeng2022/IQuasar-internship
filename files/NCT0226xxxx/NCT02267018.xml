  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm babies have immature lungs and frequent pauses in their breathing which often&#xD;
      necessitates breathing support. Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP) is one of&#xD;
      the most commonly used tools, but does not always provide enough support. A new option is&#xD;
      non-invasive high frequency ventilation (NIHFV), which gently shakes the lungs to help with&#xD;
      gas exchange and may decrease a baby's work of breathing. The investigators plan to study&#xD;
      very low birth weight preterm babies who are generally well but require some support with&#xD;
      their breathing. By inserting a special feeding tube with sensors into the stomach, the&#xD;
      investigators can measure the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), which is an&#xD;
      important muscle for breathing. By analyzing EAdi in babies receiving either nCPAP or NIHFV,&#xD;
      the investigators will be able to measure and compare how each method of support affects a&#xD;
      baby's breathing. This important study will help us determine the most appropriate breathing&#xD;
      support for preterm babies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure is one of the most researched and accepted methods of&#xD;
      delivering NIV to term and preterm infants. Non-invasive high frequency ventilation is a&#xD;
      relatively new method of delivering NIV respiratory support in preterm infants. Preliminary&#xD;
      studies suggest superiority over CPAP, and NIHFV is being increasingly utilized in clinical&#xD;
      practice in an attempt to prevent intubation and minimize ventilation-induced lung injury in&#xD;
      preterm infants. However, little is known about its mechanism of action and its effect on&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics in the newborn. The objective of this study is to compare the effects&#xD;
      of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) delivered by nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure&#xD;
      (nCPAP) versus Non-Invasive High Frequency Ventilation (NIHFV) on respiratory pattern as&#xD;
      assessed by the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) in very low birth weight (VLBW)&#xD;
      preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that in VLBW preterm infants with relative pulmonary insufficiency, NIHFV will&#xD;
      reduce respiratory drive and improve ventilation, subsequently resulting in decreased patient&#xD;
      diaphragm energy expenditure. This would be demonstrated by decreased neural respiratory&#xD;
      rates and/or decreased peak electrical activity of the diaphragm while breathing on NIHFV&#xD;
      compared to nCPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians are seeking alternative methods for providing non-invasive respiratory support to&#xD;
      preterm infants. NIHFV is a relatively new modality that is being increasingly utilized in&#xD;
      clinical practice but has not been well studied. This study will help us determine how&#xD;
      non-invasive high frequency ventilation (NIHFV) affects breathing in preterm infants, as&#xD;
      compared to the more traditional modality of nasal CPAP. Therefore, clinicians will not only&#xD;
      be able to better understand how NIHFV works, but also utilize this information to decide on&#xD;
      the most appropriate respiratory support modality for preterm patients&#xD;
