      Microcirculatory alterations occur in critically ill patients and those undergoing major&#xD;
      surgeries. The severity of perioperative microvascular alterations appear to be related to&#xD;
      the severity of organ dysfunction after surgery. Non-cardiac thoracic surgeries comprise a&#xD;
      subgroup of high risk surgical procedures which have the potential to significantly affect&#xD;
      and impair microcirculatory function but this patient population has not been well studied.&#xD;
      Esophagectomy surgery in particular produces a profound systemic inflammatory response which&#xD;
      correlates with a number of adverse outcomes. It is likely, though unproven, that&#xD;
      microcirculatory derangements may underly these phenomena. Though the study of&#xD;
      microcirculatory dysfunction in thoracic surgery is in its infancy, the body of available&#xD;
      evidence at this point supports the following hypotheses; that microcirculatory derangements&#xD;
      and dysfunction 1) occur during major surgeries including transthoracic esophagectomy 2) may&#xD;
      be related to SIRS, 3) may predict adverse outcomes, and 4) may be amenable to modification&#xD;
      via specific therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a prospective observational study to determine the effects of transthoracic&#xD;
      esophagectomy on microcirculatory function. Two hundred patients meeting inclusion criteria&#xD;
      undergoing planned transthoracic esophagectomy via thoracotomy incision will be prospectively&#xD;
      enrolled at The University of Virginia. Patients will be followed for 28 days or until&#xD;
      discharge from the ICU. Evaluation of the sublingual, gastric serosal and mucosal tissues&#xD;
      will be performed using sidestream dark field (SDF) imaging using the CytoCam® by Braedius&#xD;
      Medical BV (Huizen, The Netherlands). Scoring of the microcirculation will include an index&#xD;
      of vascular density (perfused vessel density), an assessment of capillary perfusion&#xD;
      (proportion of perfused vessels and microcirculatory flow index) and a heterogeneity index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: the CytoCam® will only take a series of images as consistent with a microscope of&#xD;
      exposed tissue. Also, the FDA Office of Device Evaluations (ODE) General Surgery Devices&#xD;
      Branch One - Light Based/laser (GSDB1) has deemed this device to be exempt from 510(K)&#xD;
      approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm?ID=5021&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from patient's medical charts before and after surgery (30 days post) will be used for&#xD;
      elucidation of specific complications. We will use the cardiovascular and respiratory&#xD;
      components of the SOFA score as independent measures of organ dysfunction. Acute kidney&#xD;
      injury will be defined by the AKIN criteria as an increase of at least 50% above baseline&#xD;
      serum creatinine and will be graded from stage 1 to 3.&#xD;

      1. Provide the scientific background, rationale and relevance of this project. The&#xD;
      microcirculation plays a fundamental role in gas and nutrient exchange; it must constantly&#xD;
      adapt by controlling vascular tone and regional blood flow. In disease states, increased&#xD;
      permeability may be necessary to produce the inflammatory response. The assessment and&#xD;
      quantification of the macrovascular hemodynamics and the assumption that it is reflective of&#xD;
      microvascular change is fundamentally flawed. Even when global hemodynamic variables are&#xD;
      corrected, many patients with circulatory failure will develop multi organ failure and&#xD;
      ultimately die. The recent advent of in vivo microcirculation monitoring has begun to improve&#xD;
      our understanding of the relationships between surgery, anesthetic management, and regulation&#xD;
      of the microcirculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcirculatory alteration also occurs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Bauer et al&#xD;
      first reported that microcirculatory perfusion was transiently altered in humans after&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass. Similar findings were reported more recently by other groups. , More&#xD;
      importantly, these alterations can also be observed in patients who undergo surgery without&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass.3 Furthermore the sublingual microcirculation was still slightly&#xD;
      abnormal up to 24 h after surgery in these patients. As in non-cardiac surgery, the severity&#xD;
      of perioperative microvascular alterations correlated with peak lactate levels and severity&#xD;
      of organ dysfunction after surgery.iii High-risk surgery is a new area in which in vivo&#xD;
      microcirculatory alterations have been observed. In patients undergoing high-risk non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery, Jhanji et al observed that the density and proportion of perfused capillaries was&#xD;
      lower in the 14 patients who subsequently developed postoperative complications than in the&#xD;
      11 patients with an uneventful postoperative course. Subcutaneous tissue PO2 and laser&#xD;
      Doppler cutaneous blood flow did not differ between the groups, further highlighting the lack&#xD;
      of sensitivity of these methods to detect heterogeneous perfusion. Interestingly, there was&#xD;
      no significant difference in global O2 delivery between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-cardiac thoracic surgeries comprise a subgroup of high risk surgical procedures which&#xD;
      have the potential to significantly affect and impair microcirculatory function. A study of&#xD;
      patients undergoing esophagectomy demonstrated significant impairment of sublingual&#xD;
      microcirculation relative to pancreaticoduodenectomy patients. Esophagectomy surgery produces&#xD;
      a profound systemic inflammatory response which correlates to a number of adverse outcomes.&#xD;
      Interestingly, the time course of microcirculatory impairment and recovery appears to&#xD;
      parallel the SIRS typically seen in surgeries of this type. Transthoracic esophagectomy is&#xD;
      typically facilitated by one lung ventilation (OLV) in an effort to optimize surgical&#xD;
      exposure to the operative hemithorax. The institution of OLV has the potential to&#xD;
      dramatically impair tissue oxygen supply demand relationships via adverse effects on systemic&#xD;
      oxygen desaturation, as a result of an increased venous admixture from right to left&#xD;
      intrapulmonary shunting, as well as decrements in cardiac output. Cerebral oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation accompanying OLV is also well described, though the pathophysiology is not well&#xD;
      understood. It is likely, though unproven, that microcirculatory derangements may underly&#xD;
      these phenomena. Though the study of microcirculatory dysfunction in thoracic surgery is in&#xD;
      its infancy, the body of available evidence at this point supports the following hypotheses;&#xD;
      that microcirculatory derangements and dysfunction 1) occur during major surgeries including&#xD;
      transthoracic esophagectomy 2) may be related to SIRS, OLV or both, 3) may predict adverse&#xD;
      outcomes, and 4) may be amenable to modification via specific therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study to see if the changes in microcirculatory parameters as observed&#xD;
      by the SDF device can accurately diagnose anastomotic and other complications for the purpose&#xD;
      of leading to a wider study of microcirculatory derangements as an indicator of risk of&#xD;
      surgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be Tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Microcirculatory derangements, as indicated by changes in microcirculation of sublingual&#xD;
      tissue, serosa tunica near the surgical division, or the mucosal lining of the stomach near&#xD;
      the surgical division, occur during transthoracic esophagectomy and in the perioperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Changes in microcirculation predicts post-operative anastomotic complications iii.&#xD;
      Changes in microcirculation predicts post-operative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether microcirculatory derangements, as indicated by changes in&#xD;
           microcirculation of sublingual tissue, serosa tunica near the surgical division, or the&#xD;
           mucosal lining of the stomach near the surgical division, occur during transthoracic&#xD;
           esophagectomy involving one lung ventilation (OLV), using a side stream dark field (SDF)&#xD;
           imaging system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. This aim will include measurements of microcirculatory parameters at multiple time&#xD;
           points within the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the temporal relationship of microcirculatory dysfunction and recovery, if&#xD;
           any, at the initiation of OLV, reestablishment of two lung ventilation, and cessation of&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. This aim will include measurements of microcirculatory parameters at multiple time&#xD;
           points within the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine whether observed changes in microcirculation is predictive of postoperative&#xD;
           organ dysfunction, and perioperative complications.&#xD;
