    <textblock>
      Severe Alcoholic hepatitis (SAH), defined by modified Maddrey's Discriminant Function (DF)&#xD;
      ≥32, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Of the various treatment&#xD;
      modalities evaluated for treatment of SAH, corticosteroids have been the most extensively&#xD;
      studied. Five out of 13 RCTs, and four out of 5 meta-analysis have shown a survival benefit&#xD;
      with corticosteroids, especially in patients with DF ≥32 and/ or encephalopathy.However, the&#xD;
      role of corticosteroids in SAH still remains somewhat controversial. Corticosteroid therapy&#xD;
      is not considered the ideal option by all authors because their beneficial effect seems to be&#xD;
      confined to a highly selected minority group in which the inhibitory effect of&#xD;
      corticosteroids on liver inflammation is not outweighed by side effects such as weakened&#xD;
      defence against infections, anti-anabolic effects, and possible ulcer promoting effects. Also&#xD;
      corticosteroids are contraindicated in patients with renal failure, gastro-intestinal (GI)&#xD;
      bleed, pancreatitis and active sepsis. Therefore, there have been constant efforts to&#xD;
      evaluate new therapies for SAH. In a recent trial, combination of glucocorticoids plus&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine was found to improve one month survival in patients with SAH, compared with&#xD;
      glucocorticoids alone. However the 6 month survival was not different in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Colostrum (HC) and Bovine Colostrum (BC) are rich in protein, immunoglobulin,&#xD;
      lactoferrin and growth factors. Recent studies suggest that colostrum components,&#xD;
      Lactroferrin, immunoglobulin and growth factor benefits physically active person and in&#xD;
      treatment of autoimmune disorders. It is used for the treatment of a wide variety of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal conditions, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gut&#xD;
      injury, H pylori infection, immune deficiency related diarrhea as well as infective diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guidelines by American College of Gastroenterology and other authors have suggested that&#xD;
      a combination of CS and other drugs, which have different mechanisms of action, may be more&#xD;
      beneficial for reducing mortality in SAH. Hence, we plan to conduct this pilot study to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of a novel combination of corticosteroids, and Bovine colostrum in&#xD;
      the treatment of SAH.&#xD;

      Severe alcoholic hepatitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis: The diagnosis of (AH) is made by the following criteria11&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.Chronic active alcohol abuse - &gt; 80 grams in males and &gt; 20 grams in females. II. Duration&#xD;
      of jaundice &lt; 3 months III. Serum Bilirubin &gt;5 mg/dl IV. AST/ALT &gt; 2:1 V. AST &lt;500 IU/L, ALT&#xD;
      &lt;300 IU/L VI. Neutrophilic leucocytosis VII. Alcohol - non - alcohol index (ANI) determines&#xD;
      the aetiology in an obese patient who drinks excessively. The ANI uses body mass index, mean&#xD;
      corpuscular volume (MCV), AST/ALT ratio and gender to determine whether the aetiology is&#xD;
      alcoholic steatohepatitis or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). A high MCV, AST/ALT ratio&#xD;
      &gt; 1, low BMI and male gender favours alcohol as the aetiology, and this is reflected as a&#xD;
      positive ANI score. A negative score implicates NASH as the cause of liver disease. The ANI&#xD;
      calculator is available online (http://www.mayoclinic.org/girst/mayomodel10.html) VIII. Ethyl&#xD;
      Glucuronide in urine12 detects alcohol intake within the last 3 days IX. Ethyl Glucuronide in&#xD;
      hair13 detects intake of alcohol within the last few months X. Serum Enzyme linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent Ethyl Glucuronide has a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 91% respectively&#xD;
      XI. Liver biopsy is useful when the diagnosis is uncertain and when corticosteroids are to be&#xD;
      given for the treatment of SAH. A Transjugular liver biopsy is performed in most patients due&#xD;
      to the coagulopathy in SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Severity Maddrey's Discriminant Function14 Discriminant Function Index (DFI)&#xD;
      was originally described by Maddrey and colleagues in a placebo controlled study to assess&#xD;
      the benefit of corticosteroids in patients with AH. The original formula was 4.6 x&#xD;
      prothrombin time (PT) (seconds) + serum Bilirubin (mg/dl). It was observed that patients with&#xD;
      a DFI &gt;93 and treated with placebo had a 28 day survival of 25%, whereas those with a DFI &lt;&#xD;
      93 had a 100% survival. Subsequently this score was modified in 19896 and called Modified&#xD;
      Discriminant Function (MDF). MDF = 4.6 x (Patient's PT - Control PT) + serum bilirubin&#xD;
      (mg/dl). Untreated patients with MDF &gt;32 had a survival of 68%. The American College of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology9 recommends that patients with MDF &gt; 32 and / or Encephalopathy (SAH) be&#xD;
      treated with Corticosteroids. The prothrombin time varies greatly depending on the&#xD;
      sensitivity of the thromboplastin reagent used for the test. This is the drawback of the MDF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MELD score15 The model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score predicts survival in patients&#xD;
      with cirrhosis and is used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MELD score = (0.957 x log serum creatinine + 0.378 x log serum bilirubin + 1.120 x log INR +&#xD;
      0.643) x 10. The advantage of MELD score is the use of INR in place of PT. The INR is&#xD;
      comparable and uniform across laboratories worldwide. The American Association for Study of&#xD;
      Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends that a MELD score &gt;20 predicts SAH and should be the&#xD;
      criterion for initiating treatment. Serial monitoring of MELD score with a change of 2 or&#xD;
      more points over the first week on treatment has independently predicted mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GAHS score16 Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score (GAHS) includes age, peripheral Total&#xD;
      Leucocyte Count, serum Bilirubin (at days 1 and 6-9), blood urea nitrogen and PT. It is a&#xD;
      better predictor of mortality at 28 days than MDF. GAHS score &gt; 9 has an extremely poor&#xD;
      prognosis unless treated with Corticosteroids. The drawback is lack of international&#xD;
      validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child - Turcotte - Pugh score17 It is not traditionally used for predicting mortality of SAH.&#xD;
      However, it helps to predict mortality at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Abstinence from alcohol This is the most important factor in predicting the outcome&#xD;
      after surviving the acute alcoholic hepatitis (AH) episode. The incidence of recidivism after&#xD;
      recovery from the first episode of AH varies from 10 - 70 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition Enteral nutrition is the preferred mode for supplemental nutrition. It is cheap,&#xD;
      maintains gut mucosal integrity. This in turn decreases the risk of bacterial and endotoxin&#xD;
      translocation resulting in less infections and endotoxemia. Pooled data from 5 RCT's of AH&#xD;
      have demonstrated improved nutritional status compared to standard dietary intake, but&#xD;
      without improving survival rates.18 Pharmacotherapy Corticosteroids Corticosteroids (CS) are&#xD;
      the most extensively used treatment for SAH. 6/13 RCT's and 4/6 meta-analysis have supported&#xD;
      the use of CS in SAH. The last meta-analysis of individual patient data from 5 high quality&#xD;
      RCT's using CS for SAH concluded that CS confers a 50% relative survival benefit at 1 month&#xD;
      (85% versus 65% survival amongst those treated with CS versus untreated patients. The number&#xD;
      of patients needed to treated (NNT) is 5 to reduce one death. Oral Prednisolone 40mg daily or&#xD;
      parenteral methylprednisolone (for patients unable to take orally) 32 mg intravenously daily&#xD;
      for 4 weeks is the standard therapy. The CS is tapered off over the next 4 weeks. A Lille&#xD;
      score of &gt;0.45 after 7 days of treatment with CS is an indication of non-response, increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to infections and diminished survival19. The CS should be stopped if the lilli&#xD;
      score is &gt;0.45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pentoxifylline Pentoxifylline is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. It is given orally in the&#xD;
      dose of 400mg thrice a day for 28 days. In a pivotal study of 101 patients of SAH21, it was&#xD;
      associated with survival benefit of 50%. In another study, it was found to be superior to&#xD;
      CS20. In a recent study involving 50 patients at our center21, we found that 20% vs 40%&#xD;
      mortality in patients treated with Pentoxifylline versus controls, after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. Acute kidney injury was the cause of death in 20% compared to 70% patients in PTX&#xD;
      group versus controls. PTX induces recovery of renal &amp; hepatic functions with a trend towards&#xD;
      increased survival. However, a metanalysis of 5 RCT failed to show any benefit with PTX22.&#xD;
      The major adverse effects include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and skin rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-Acetylcyteine N-acetylcysteine could have value as an antioxidant in the treatment of acute&#xD;
      alcoholic hepatitis, because the thiol group in N-acetylcysteine is able to reduce levels of&#xD;
      free radicals. Administration of N-acetylcysteine might reconstitute the glutathione stocks&#xD;
      of the hepatocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, N-acetylcysteine is used in the treatment of acetaminophen induced hepatitis.&#xD;
      Intravenous (I.V.) acetylcysteine is most often used as an antidote for acetaminophen&#xD;
      overdose due to its ability to increase levels of glutathione; however, it is also used to&#xD;
      treat non-acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure (NAI-ALF) and severe alcoholic hepatitis&#xD;
      and to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Although the i.v. and oral formulations of&#xD;
      acetylcysteine have been evaluated for these indications, most studies have examined the i.v.&#xD;
      form. I.V. acetylcysteine is used in the treatment of NAI-ALF to improve oxygenation to the&#xD;
      liver. A trial to evaluate the efficacy of glucocorticoids plus N-acetylcysteine, as compared&#xD;
      with glucocorticoids alone, in patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis.23 reported&#xD;
      improved one month survival in the combined treatment group. However the 6 month survival was&#xD;
      not different in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bovine colostrum Human colostrum (HC) is the first milk produced after birth and is&#xD;
      particularly rich in immunoglobulin (Ig), antimicrobial peptides (lactoferrin and lacto&#xD;
      peroxidase) and other bioactive molecule, including growth factors which are important for&#xD;
      nutrition, growth and development of newborn infants and also for passive immunity. Bovine&#xD;
      colostrum (BC) is produced by the cows during the first 2 days post parturition. This &quot;early&quot;&#xD;
      milk has nutrient profile and immunological composition substantially different from 'mature'&#xD;
      milk. It contains macronutrient like proteins, carbohydrate, oligosaccharides, fats and&#xD;
      micronutrients like vitamins and minerals, also growth factors, anti-microbial compounds and&#xD;
      immune regulating constituents either not present in mature milk or present substantially in&#xD;
      lower concentration.24,25 Historically colostrum has been used for various illnesses in India&#xD;
      as well as abroad for thousands of years. Ayurvedic physicians of India have used bovine&#xD;
      colostrum for both medicinal and spiritual purposes since cows were first domesticated. By&#xD;
      the late 18th century, Western medicine started to take an interest in colostrum and study it&#xD;
      for its potential health benefits. As a consequence, it was prescribed for many conditions,&#xD;
      including immune system enhancement. Interestingly, until the development of penicillin and&#xD;
      other artificial antibiotics in the 20th century, colostrum was commonly used for fighting&#xD;
      bacterial infections. In the early 20th century it was noted that antibody levels in the&#xD;
      first milk produced after birth were much higher than levels found in the milk that was&#xD;
      produced 72 hours later. There are now over 2000 published scientific articles that document&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of using colostrum. This seemingly perfect food has been shown to be&#xD;
      non-species specific26. In 2005, it was reported that is safe and effective in repair of&#xD;
      tissues as well as for enhancing immunity.27 The use of bovine colostrum as dietary&#xD;
      supplement has increased substantially over the past decades. Bovine colostrum is harvested&#xD;
      within first few hours of calving from dairy animals. The herds of cows are kept under close&#xD;
      supervision in good state of hygiene without exposure to antibodies, pesticides and&#xD;
      anithelmintic. They are monitored according to FDA criteria. The colostrum collected within&#xD;
      24 hours contains maximum substances but less in amounts, colostrum collected later will be&#xD;
      more but contain less immunoglobins.27 Colostrum contains the growth factors that help build&#xD;
      lean muscle, including insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I &amp; IGF-II) and growth hormone (GH).&#xD;
      IGF-I, which is found naturally in colostrum, is the only natural hormone capable of&#xD;
      promoting muscle growth by itself. The IGFs in humans and cows are identical, but bovine&#xD;
      colostrum actually contains a greater concentration of IGF-I than human colostrum. This fact&#xD;
      makes bovine colostrum attractive to bodybuilders, athletes and others seeking to gain muscle&#xD;
      mass. According to a study conducted in Finland, IGF-1 induces protein synthesis, which leads&#xD;
      to an increase in lean muscle mass without a corresponding rise in adipose (fat) tissue. The&#xD;
      growth factors in colostrum &quot;shift fuel utilization from carbohydrate to fat. It mean that&#xD;
      body will burn more fat, including fat made from the carbohydrate and protein that are&#xD;
      consumed, producing fuel more efficiently.28 Bovine has hormone factor like gastrin which&#xD;
      plays a role as a trophic factor for mucosal growth with in stomach. GLP-2 has shown a&#xD;
      general trophic response with in the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peptide growth factors in colostrum can influence the maintenance of mucosal mass and&#xD;
      integrity. EGF stimulates cell proinfection and also influences crypt fission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human colostrum has higher concentration of growth factors as compared to bovine colostrum.&#xD;
      The tables and figure below indicate how HC and BC differ in their nutrient content,&#xD;
      immunological factors and growth factors (Table 1, 2,3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      While BC are considered a rich source of Ig, growth factors, and lactoferrin, currently no&#xD;
      specific standards exist that define BC dietary supplements with respect to actual&#xD;
      constituents or amounts of constituents. The following constituents are generally present in&#xD;
      bovine colostrums: macronutrients; vitamins; minerals; Ig (IgG, IgM, and IgA - including the&#xD;
      secretory form); cytokines including interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), interleukin- 6 (IL-6), tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (INF-γ); growth factors including&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I and II, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor; lactoperoxidase; and lactoferrin. Depending on the health of the&#xD;
      cows, feeding practices followed, collection period, and the processing/concentration&#xD;
      practices utilized by specific manufacturers, the actual range and quantities of specific&#xD;
      macro- and micronutrients, Ig, cytokines, growth factors, and other compounds might vary&#xD;
      considerably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BC contain relatively high amounts of Ig. Typically, Ig in general, and IgG specifically,&#xD;
      constitutes the largest contribution to protein content in BC, with lactalbumin and casein&#xD;
      contributing lesser amounts. Mean percentages of fat, protein, and lactose in colostrum were&#xD;
      6.7, 14.9, and 2.5, respectively. Other reports have estimated Ig concentrations from bovine&#xD;
      mammary secretions with ranges for IgG1 (52-87 g/L), IgG2 (1.6-2.1 g/L), IgM (3.7-6.1 g/L),&#xD;
      and IgA (3.2-6.2 g/L).35 As a rule, the Ig contribution will decline substantially in any BC&#xD;
      collected more than 24 hours post-parturition and the amount of lactalbumin and casein will&#xD;
      increase proportionately.&#xD;
