  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Prevention of diabetes is an&#xD;
      important goal. The progression from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes is thought to be&#xD;
      promoted by the toxic effects of hyperglycemia on pancreatic beta cells. One of the main&#xD;
      defects causing postprandial hyperglycemia in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance is&#xD;
      reduced first phase (immediate) insulin release. The investigators hypothesis is that&#xD;
      consuming a nutritional preload--a low-calorie, nutritionally balanced snack--30 minutes&#xD;
      before ingesting a carbohydrate load, will moderate the hyperglycemic response to subsequent&#xD;
      carbohydrate challenge and reduce glucotoxicity by stimulating insulin release and synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test this hypothesis by comparing the standard 75-gram, two-hour&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) response of 30 fasting adults who have impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance to their OGTT response when the test is preceded by Â½ ounce (14 grams) of&#xD;
      dry-roasted, unsalted almonds. A pre-load interval of 30 minutes was chosen so that the peak&#xD;
      of phase 2 (delayed) insulin response to the pre-load (45-60 minutes) would coincide with the&#xD;
      timeframe of the steepest OGTT rise in glucose (15 to 30 minutes post challenge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the one-hour OGTT glucose level will be approximately 40&#xD;
      mg/dl lower when participants consume the pre-OGTT almond snack, compared to their one-hour&#xD;
      glucose level on the standard two-hour OGTT. The two-hour OGTT glucose level is unlikely to&#xD;
      show a statistically significant difference between the almond pre-test snack and control&#xD;
      standard OGTT conditions.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted at Physicians at Sugar Creek (PSC)-the model family practice&#xD;
      center for the Memorial Family Medicine Residency Program. The ethnicity of PSC patients is&#xD;
      approximately 30% non-Hispanic white, 30% Hispanic, 30% African-American, and 10% Asian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified by searching PSC electronic medical records&#xD;
      (Centricity) to find adults aged 18-75 with impaired glucose tolerance, without diabetes&#xD;
      (one-hour oral glucose tolerance test result &gt;160 md/dl and two-hour OGTT result &lt;200 mg/dl),&#xD;
      without hypoglycemic medications and corticosteroids on their active medications list, and&#xD;
      without almond allergy on their allergy list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment flyers will be posted in the clinic to encourage interested individuals to&#xD;
      contact the investigators about their potential study eligibility. The investigators will&#xD;
      also approach previously identified potentially eligible patients during routine clinical&#xD;
      visits in the clinic, to elicit their interest in participating in the study. Those&#xD;
      expressing interest will be scheduled for an intake visit with an investigator, to further&#xD;
      ascertain their eligibility and invite eligible individuals to take part in the study.&#xD;
      Interested eligible individuals who render verbal and written informed consent will then be&#xD;
      instructed in the study protocol and scheduled for their first data gathering visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be scheduled to undergo two 2-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT),&#xD;
      starting between 7:00 and 9:30 a.m., one to four weeks apart. Test A will be a standard&#xD;
      75-gram OGTT. Test B will be an OGTT that will begin 30 minutes after ingestion of a&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate pre-load &quot;snack&quot; consisting of 1/2 oz (14 grams) of unsalted, dry-roasted&#xD;
      almonds (12 average size almonds). Each participant will be given an 8-ounce glass of water&#xD;
      to drink with the almonds. Participants will be randomized to one of two test sequences (A-B&#xD;
      or B-A), to control for sequence effects on results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize variability of OGTT results, participants will be asked to eat as they usually do&#xD;
      throughout the study. Participants will be asked to refrain from vigorous physical activity&#xD;
      for 8 hours prior to each OGTT and to minimize their physical activity during each OGTT.&#xD;
      Participants will complete a Perceived Stress Scale and a 24-hour food, alcohol, and activity&#xD;
      recall for the day before each OGTT to analyze potential confounding effects of stress, diet,&#xD;
      alcohol, and physical activity on the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling will be done for serial measurements of plasma glucose at time-zero, and at&#xD;
      60-minute intervals for two hours after each 75-gram glucose load. An investigator will&#xD;
      monitor the timing of each blood draw closely to ensure timeliness. Blood will be drawn by&#xD;
      one of two phlebotomists in the on-site laboratory and sent to the Memorial Hermann Southwest&#xD;
      Hospital or Quest Lab (the latter only for the control OGTT, for patients whose insurance&#xD;
      requires this) for analysis. The glucose results will be reported electronically to the&#xD;
      patient's medical record in the routine manner for blood test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will abstract the glucose results from the patients' electronic medical records&#xD;
      for data analysis purposes. The primary dependent variable is the mean difference in plasma&#xD;
      glucose (fasting to 1-hr post 75-g glucose challenge, with vs. without snack. The secondary&#xD;
      dependent variable is the mean difference in plasma glucose (fasting to 2-hr post 75-g&#xD;
      glucose challenge, with vs. without snack). Student's t test will be used to analyze the&#xD;
      differences between the standard 75-g OGTT results and the OGTT results following the almond&#xD;
      pre-test snack. Analysis of variance will be used to analyze the data for confounding effects&#xD;
      of ethnicity, gender, body mass index (BMI), and pre-test food and alcohol intake, physical&#xD;
      activity, and perceived stress level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive their individual results and an investigator-generated evaluative&#xD;
      commentary in a routine &quot;lab letter&quot;. The results letter will be forwarded to each patient's&#xD;
      primary care provider for review and appropriate clinical follow-up. Patients' results will&#xD;
      be communicated scientifically in an aggregate manner, with no individual identifying&#xD;
      information, to maintain patient confidentiality.&#xD;
