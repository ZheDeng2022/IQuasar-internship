    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare local corticosteroid hand and elbow&#xD;
      injections to placebo or ketorolac to determine if there is an equal or better reduction of&#xD;
      symptoms for common orthopaedic upper extremity disorders including: De Quervain's&#xD;
      tenosynovitis, trigger fingers, and tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis). The investigators&#xD;
      will enroll 780 subjects, divided equally into three arms for each disease process, and&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of Ketorolac injections to Dexamethasone injections by measuring&#xD;
      patient's functional status scores and pain scores at 0 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks,&#xD;
      and 6 month followup periods, prospectively over time.&#xD;

      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to compare local corticosteroid hand and&#xD;
      elbow injections to placebo or ketorolac to determine if there is an equal or better&#xD;
      reduction of symptoms for common orthopaedic upper extremity disorders including: De&#xD;
      Quervain's tenosynovitis, trigger fingers, and tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects: 780 total subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • 260 subjects in each of the 3 treatment groups (De Quervain's tenosynovitis, trigger&#xD;
      fingers and lateral epicondylitis) Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria Subjects 18 years or&#xD;
      older, with any of the following diagnoses: De Quervain's tenosynovitis, trigger fingers, or&#xD;
      lateral epicondylitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product, Dose, Route, Regimen: Peritendinous soft tissue injection for De Quervain's&#xD;
      tenosynovitis, trigger fingers and lateral epicondylitis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • 1 mL of ketorolac (30mg/mL) and 0.5 mL (5mg) of 1% lidocaine Duration of administration&#xD;
      Single administration, with a second injection permitted only once as subject desires due to&#xD;
      no major clinical response at the 4 or 8-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference therapy: Standard of care peritendinous soft tissue injection for De Quervain's&#xD;
      tenosynovitis, trigger fingers, and lateral epicondylitis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • 1 mL of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (4mg/mL) and 0.5 mL (5mg) of 1% lidocaine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology: The sample size as stated above was derived by a power analysis. A&#xD;
      power analysis indicated that a total sample size of 200 patients randomized equally (1:1&#xD;
      randomization) to each treatment arm (i.e trigger finger, De Quervain's disease, and tennis&#xD;
      elbow) without any blocking or stratification would provide 80% statistical power (alpha=.05,&#xD;
      beta=0.20) to detect a 10% difference in mean Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and&#xD;
      Hand (quickDASH) scores between cohorts assuming a common standard deviation of 25% (effect&#xD;
      size = 10/25 = 0.4). To account for an estimated 30% loss to follow-up, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to enroll a total of 260 patients per treatment arm (i.e. trigger finger, De Quervain's&#xD;
      disease, and tennis elbow). In total, there will be approximately 780 patients enrolled among&#xD;
      all treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Background Many orthopaedic hand disorders are comprised of different forms of&#xD;
      tendonitis, tenosynovitis, and arthritis. The inflammatory processes of these disorders cause&#xD;
      discomfort and functional impairment for patients. Decreasing the inflammatory response by&#xD;
      use of splinting, physiotherapy, systemic anti-inflammatory agents, and local&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory injections helps to alleviate some or all of the discomfort (2-4). Steroid&#xD;
      injections are not entirely benign, and complications include tendon ruptures, subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat atrophy, skin pigmentation changes, cartilage damage, and hyperglycemic responses in&#xD;
      diabetics (9-11, 22-23). Studies have shown that ketorolac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      agent has a potent anti-inflammatory effect comparable to corticosteroids and a strong&#xD;
      analgesic effect allowing for reduced opioid consumption postoperatively (7, 8). One could&#xD;
      argue that the potent anti-inflammatory properties of ketorolac could be used to substitute&#xD;
      for local corticosteroid injections in treating certain hand disorders. Given the side-effect&#xD;
      profile for corticosteroids it may be beneficial to treat inflammatory disorders with local&#xD;
      ketorolac injections. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents also have their known systemic&#xD;
      adverse effects including gastric ulceration and intestinal bleeding as well as impairment of&#xD;
      renal function. Most of these side effects are theoretically avoided with local tissue&#xD;
      injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Study Drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketorolac:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed use of ketorolac in this study is outside of the FDA-approved indication and is&#xD;
      the investigational agent in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The approved indication for&#xD;
      Ketorolac is for the short-term (≤5 days) management of moderately severe, acute pain that&#xD;
      requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. It is highly&#xD;
      protein bound (99%) and is largely metabolized by the liver. In it's approved indication it&#xD;
      is contraindicated for those with renal impairment, active peptic ulcer disease, pregnant or&#xD;
      nursing females, individuals with NSAID hypersensitivity, or individuals at high risk for&#xD;
      bleeding/clotting disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid and possesses glucocorticoid activity, and will&#xD;
      be used within its labeled indication for this study: intra-articular or soft tissue&#xD;
      injection for: synovitis of osteoarthritis, epicondylitis, acute nonspecific tenosynovitis.&#xD;
      It is the active comparator in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In its approved indication there use limitations for immunocompromised individuals, pregnant&#xD;
      females, persons with allergy to steroids, individuals with systemic fungal infections, and&#xD;
      individuals with cerebral malaria. It is contra-indicated in systemic fungal infections, and&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to any component of this product, including sulfites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine is a local anesthetic of the amide type, and will be used within its labeled&#xD;
      indication for this study: production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration&#xD;
      techniques such as percutaneous injection. It is to be given as concomitant therapy with both&#xD;
      the investigational agent, ketorolac injection, and the standard of care therapy,&#xD;
      dexamethasone injection.&#xD;

        <description>The QuickDASH (Quick - Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) is an 11-question standardized survey used to assess a patient's overall functional status and is widely used in the practice of orthopaedic surgery as an analog measurement of a patient's functional ability. Scores range from 0-100, with 100 being the most poor functionality and 0 being the best. This will be assessed at every visit by having the patient fill out the survey and our team calculating the score at the end of the visit.</description>

        <title>De Quervain's Treatment Group: QuickDASH Scores</title>
        <description>The QuickDASH (Quick - Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) is an 11-question standardized survey used to assess a patient's overall functional status and is widely used in the practice of orthopaedic surgery as an analog measurement of a patient's functional ability. Scores range from 0-100, with 100 being the most poor functionality and 0 being the best. This will be assessed at every visit by having the patient fill out the survey and our team calculating the score at the end of the visit.</description>

          <title>Lateral Epicondylitis Treatment Group: QuickDASH Functional Scores</title>
          <description>The QuickDASH (Quick - Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) is an 11-question standardized survey used to assess a patient's overall functional status and is widely used in the practice of orthopaedic surgery as an analog measurement of a patient's functional ability. Scores range from 0-100, with 100 being the most poor functionality and 0 being the best. This will be assessed at every visit by having the patient fill out the survey and our team calculating the score at the end of the visit.</description>
