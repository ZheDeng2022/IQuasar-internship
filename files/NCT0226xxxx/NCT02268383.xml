      Study A536-05 is an open-label extension study for patients previously enrolled in study&#xD;
      A536-03 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01749514), to evaluate the long-term safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ACE-536 in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS.&#xD;

      Study A536-05 is an open-label extension study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effects of up to 24 months of ACE-536 treatment in patients with low or&#xD;
      intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes previously treated with ACE-536 for up to 3&#xD;
      months in study A536-03 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01749514). The starting dose level&#xD;
      in study A536-05 will be 1.0 mg/kg by subcutaneous (SC) injection every 3 weeks. Dose&#xD;
      titration/modification rules will be followed for individual patients and will be based upon&#xD;
      safety and efficacy data collected during the course of treatment.&#xD;
