  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, multi-dose phase II proof of principle trial to study&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of AbGn-168H in patients with moderate to severe active psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis. A minimum of 15 patients and a maximum of 20 will be recruited in 1 dosing group.&#xD;
      For safety evaluation, the parameters to be assessed include physical examination, vital&#xD;
      signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature), 12-lead ECG,&#xD;
      safety laboratory tests, adverse events and tolerability. For efficacy evaluation, patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated for proportion of subject reaching American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR&#xD;
      20) in week 12 and proportion of subjects reaching ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 at different&#xD;
      time points; Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) at different time points, as well as Target&#xD;
      Lesion Psoriasis Severity Score (TLPSS) and static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) for&#xD;
      subjects with active skin lesions at different time point.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Patients must have moderate to severe active PsA at screening and baseline, defined as&#xD;
             having greater than or equal to 3 tender (out of 68) and 3 swollen (out of 66) joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have at least one evaluable skin plaque, 2 cm in diameter, that can be&#xD;
             followed with a target lesions score (scalp and groin lesions cannot be used), or&#xD;
             documented psoriasis history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have history of inadequate response or intolerance to NSAID or DMARD&#xD;
             defined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If the patient is taking background corticosteroids, dose must be ≤ 10 mg/day&#xD;
             prednisone (or equivalent) and must have been at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of psoriasis&#xD;
             arthritis is permitted if the dose has been stable for at least 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. If the patient is taking methotrexate (MTX), the patient must have received&#xD;
             methotrexate 7.5-25 mg/wk (p.o. or parenteral) for at least 12 weeks and at a stable&#xD;
             dose for 4 weeks prior to screening. If the patient is not taking MTX, they must have&#xD;
             been off the drug for at least 8 weeks prior to receiving the first dose (baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Folic acid or folinic acid is required at least 1 mg per day or 5 mg per week for all&#xD;
             patients taking MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Whether or not the patient is taking methotrexate, all DMARDs (other than MTX) should&#xD;
             be withdrawn at least 4 weeks prior to baseline (Visit 2) of first drug administration&#xD;
             (4 weeks for etanercept, 8 weeks for infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab&#xD;
             pegol and leflunomide, and 12 weeks for ustekinumab, c.f. Section 4.2.2). Subjects&#xD;
             taking appremilast should discontinue the medication 2 weeks prior to receiving the&#xD;
             first dose (baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to&#xD;
             enrolment. Male and female of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly&#xD;
             effective method of birth control during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A female is considered of childbearing potential following menarche and until becoming&#xD;
        post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include&#xD;
        hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral oophorectomy.&#xD;
        A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical&#xD;
        cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be&#xD;
        used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or&#xD;
        hormonal replacement therapy. However in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single&#xD;
        FSH measurement is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral&#xD;
        orchidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in a low failure&#xD;
        rate (less than 1% per year).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of malignancy in the past 5 years or suspicion of active malignant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Evidence of current or previous clinically significant disease, medical condition&#xD;
             other than psoriatic arthritis, or finding of the medical examination (including vital&#xD;
             signs and ECG), that in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety&#xD;
             of the patient or the quality of the data. This criterion provides an opportunity for&#xD;
             the investigator to exclude patients based on clinical judgment, even if other&#xD;
             eligibility criteria are satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of another rheumatic or skin disease that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, could confound the ability to discern response.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. HIV infection or a known HIV-related Malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Chronic or acute hepatitis B and C, or carrier status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of recurrent significant infection; known active bacterial, viral, fungal,&#xD;
             mycobacterial infection, or any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization&#xD;
             or treatment with iv antibiotics within 4 weeks of screening or oral antibiotics&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Tuberculosis or a positive Quantiferon test for tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of allergy/hypersensitivity to a systemically administered biologic agent or&#xD;
             its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Intake of restricted medications (c.f. Section 4.2.2) or other drugs considered likely&#xD;
             to interfere with the safe conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Previous treatment with any cell-depleting therapies, including investigational agents&#xD;
             (e.g., CAMPATH, anti-CD4, anti-CD5, anti-CD3). Patients with Orencia or Toclizumab&#xD;
             treatment within 8 weeks, IVIG, Natalizumab or Prosorba Column treatment within 6&#xD;
             months, and anti-CD19 or anti-CD20 treatment within 1 year should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Immunization with a vaccine within 4 weeks prior to baseline (Visit 2) of the first&#xD;
             drug administration (e.g.; MMR, Varivax).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Current alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Current drug abuse or positive drug screen at screening visit. Subjects with&#xD;
             legitimate medically supervised uses of the drugs which are not excluded for other&#xD;
             reasons (Section 4.2.2 of the protocol) can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with any of the following laboratory values at screening and are considered&#xD;
             clinically significant by the investigators:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Haemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL, hematocrit, white blood cell count, absolute lymphocyte or&#xD;
                  platelet count &lt; LLN (below the lower limit of the reference normal range), or&#xD;
                  absolute neutrophil &lt; 1500/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT, AST and/or total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities other than those listed on&#xD;
