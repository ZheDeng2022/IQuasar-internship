      Influenza ('flu) can cause severe infections, especially in people with weakened immune&#xD;
      systems such as those with HIV. For this reason, yearly vaccination is recommended with the&#xD;
      standard 'inactivated' influenza vaccine to try and prevent infections in these populations.&#xD;
      It is also recommended in all health care workers, to help prevent the spread of influenza&#xD;
      within healthcare settings. However, having HIV infection may mean vaccines work less well in&#xD;
      some people and the investigators do not completely understand why. An alternative to the&#xD;
      standard 'inactivated' annual influenza vaccine is the 'live attenuated influenza vaccine'&#xD;
      (LAIV), which means it consists of weakened versions of the influenza virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike the standard vaccine, which is given by injection, LAIV is a spray that is given into&#xD;
      each nostril. It is now given to children in the UK in preference to the standard vaccine as&#xD;
      it results in greater protection from influenza. In some other countries, like the USA,&#xD;
      adults are also given LAIV, where it seems to work just as well as the standard vaccine. A&#xD;
      few studies in the past have shown that LAIV is safe and effective in HIVinfected children&#xD;
      and adults. The investigators want to give LAIV to HIVinfected and HIV negative individuals,&#xD;
      to try to find out new information about how HIV infection may change the way in which people&#xD;
      respond to vaccines. The investigators will do this by comparing both the early genetic&#xD;
      response to the vaccines and later responses from cells specifically targeted to fight&#xD;
      influenza ('Tcells'), in these groups. In the long term, the investigators hope that this&#xD;
      will lead to designing new ways of improving the response to vaccines in HIVinfected people.&#xD;
      As LAIV is given into each nostril, rather than an injection, the investigators also want to&#xD;
      see if LAIV results in Tcells in the lung that are specifically targeted to fight influenza&#xD;

      The emerging field of systems vaccinology offers an unbiased, global approach to studying&#xD;
      immune responses to vaccines, unlike the traditional reductionist approaches that focus on&#xD;
      specific arms of the immune system (1,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent work has studied responses to the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and&#xD;
      intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in immunocompetent adults, showing&#xD;
      contrasting early transcriptional signatures elicited by the two vaccines (3). LAIV induces&#xD;
      type I interferon related genes, antigen presenting cells (3) and mucosal IgA (4), suggesting&#xD;
      that protection may be conferred via mucosal immunity and Tcells primed by early innate&#xD;
      responses (5,6), rather than the TIV induced systemic antibody response. This approach has&#xD;
      revealed novel insights into how early molecular signatures (e.g. expression of&#xD;
      Calcium/calmodulin dependent kinase IV) correlates with later humoral immune responses, but&#xD;
      similar relationships between innate and Tcell responses in response to LAIV remain&#xD;
      unexplored3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza is a common respiratory viral infection in HIV infected individuals worldwide, who&#xD;
      are at a greater risk of severe infection even in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era (7,8).&#xD;
      Although immunization with TIV reduces these risks, as with other vaccines in HIVinfected&#xD;
      individuals (9,10), TIV is poorly immunogenic in the immunosuppressed and new strategies are&#xD;
      required to optimise protective immunity (1114). A systems vaccinology approach comparing the&#xD;
      effects of LAIV in HIV infected and uninfected adults could reveal novel mechanisms of&#xD;
      vaccine failure in those with suboptimal vaccine responses and in turn lead to potential ways&#xD;
      of subverting this immune defect (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LAIV is licensed for use in healthy children and adults aged 2 - 49 years in the United&#xD;
      States of America. It has also been introduced for vaccination of children in the UK in 2013&#xD;
      onwards, with a license for use in children and adolescents aged 24 months to 18 years of age&#xD;
      (including those with asymptomatic HIV infection). Although initial concerns existed about&#xD;
      the safety of LAIV in HIV infected individuals, several studies in both children and adults&#xD;
      have not demonstrated any significant adverse effects (1518). A large study that administered&#xD;
      either LAIV (n = 122) or TIV (n = 121) to HIV infected children (mean age 12) found the&#xD;
      safety profile of the two vaccines to be similar (including incidence of pulmonary symptoms),&#xD;
      other than an increased incidence of injection site reactions in the TIV arm (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No effect on CD4 count or viral load was observed. Approximately 23% of children were found&#xD;
      to shed vaccine strains of influenza within the first week following vaccination, which is&#xD;
      similar to rates in HIV negative children. A study of HIV infected (n = 57) and uninfected (n&#xD;
      = 54) adults also reported a similar safety profile, with rates of reactogenicity following&#xD;
      LAIV equivalent between the two groups, but also no different to placebo arms, other than an&#xD;
      increase in mild self limiting rhinorrhea and nasal congestion in the LAIV arms (16).&#xD;
      Interestingly, in contrast to studies in children, only one adult was found to shed vaccine&#xD;
      influenza strains, which is likely due to the attenuated nature of LAIV and preexisting&#xD;
      antiinfluenza immunity in adults. While traditionally HIV infection is a relative&#xD;
      contraindication to live vaccine administration, there is also now good experience with&#xD;
      safely using live vaccines such as the Yellow Fever vaccine in subjects with CD4 counts&#xD;
      &gt;200/mm3 (19) and is included in travel vaccination guidance for HIV infected individuals who&#xD;
      meet these criteria (20). Recent guidance on immunisation of immunocompromised adults also&#xD;
      recommends the use of live varicella vaccine in HIV infected adults who are not severely&#xD;
      immunocompromised and are nonimmune to varicella (20). As live vaccines typically induce a&#xD;
      more potent immune response than inactivated or subunit vaccines, this approach warrants&#xD;
      further investigation in HIV infected subjects. While LAIV is more immunogenic than TIV in&#xD;
      children (21,22), data suggests that LAIV and TIV have similar effectiveness in preventing&#xD;
      influenza in healthy adults, despite lower antibody seroconversionin LAIV (23,24). LAIV is&#xD;
      more likely to confer protection via innate immune priming of mucosal cellular responses&#xD;
      (3,23,24). In addition, LAIV may provide protection against mismatched strains of influenza&#xD;
      (21,22) and unlike TIV, result in protective immunity that extends beyond the year of&#xD;
      administration (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of Tcell responses in reducing the severity of influenza is increasingly&#xD;
      recognised (26) and may be a better correlate of protection than antibodies in the elderly&#xD;
      (2729). Murine data have demonstrated the role of LAIV elicited pulmonary influenza specific&#xD;
      CD8+ Tcells, in providing longlived protection against subsequent viral challenge (3032),&#xD;
      although this is yet to be confirmed in human studies. This protection appears to extend to&#xD;
      heterologous viruses, as the Tcell response is directed primarily at internal proteins, which&#xD;
      are conserved across many strains. This is important, given the ongoing threat of new&#xD;
      emerging influenza viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infected subjects have impaired naturally acquired influenza specific Tcell responses in&#xD;
      both blood and lung (33,34). No human studies exist on the degree of pulmonary Tcell immunity&#xD;
      induced by LAIV in HIV infected or immunocompetent adults. No studies have also used a&#xD;
      systems biology approach to study the immune response to live vaccine challenge in&#xD;
      HIVinfection. While HIVinfected subjects may display an aberrant systemic immune response to&#xD;
      LAIV, it could also provide a useful strategy to induce potent heterotypic mucosal immunity&#xD;
      in a population who display suboptimal responses to TIV. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable NHS R&amp;D Form&#xD;
      IRAS Version 3.5 8 155866/618731/14/528 many strains. This is important, given the ongoing&#xD;
      threat of new emerging influenza viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infected subjects have impaired naturally acquired influenza specific Tcell responses in&#xD;
      both blood and lung (33,34). No human studies exist on the degree of pulmonary Tcell immunity&#xD;
      induced by LAIV in HIV infected or immunocompetent adults. No studies have also used a&#xD;

      infection. While HIV infected subjects may display an aberrant systemic immune response to&#xD;
