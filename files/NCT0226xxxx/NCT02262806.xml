      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Partial lipodystrophy can cause high blood fat levels and resistance to insulin. This can&#xD;
      lead to health problems including diabetes. Researchers have found that the drug metreleptin&#xD;
      improves health in people with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of metreleptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People age 6 months and older with partial lipodystrophy who&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have received metreleptin through NIH studies and shown improvement AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cannot get metreleptin other ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will come to NIH approximately every 6 months during year one, then every 1&#xD;
           2 years. Financial assistance may be available for travel within the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visits, participants will get a supply of metreleptin to take home for daily&#xD;
           injections, or it can be shipped to them inside the U.S. They will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  plastic catheter placed in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood tests, urine collection, and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oral glucose tolerance test, drinking a sweet liquid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ultrasound of the heart, liver, uterus, and ovaries. A gel and a probe are placed on the&#xD;
           skin and pictures are taken of the organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  echocardiogram, which takes pictures of the heart with sound waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting Metabolic Rate taken. A plastic hood is worn over the head while the oxygen they&#xD;
           breathe is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have up to 3 DEXA scan x-rays per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  annual bone x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  liver biopsies every few years. A needle will be inserted into the liver to obtain a&#xD;
           small piece. Participants will sign a separate consent for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be seen regularly by their local doctors and have blood tests at least&#xD;
           every 3-6 months at home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that can be thought of as a signal from adipose tissue&#xD;
      to the rest of the body conveying information about long-term nutritional status. Patients&#xD;
      with lipodystrophy have leptin deficiency secondary to lack of adipose tissue. The&#xD;
      combination of leptin deficiency and ectopic lipid deposition in patients with lipodystrophy&#xD;
      leads to metabolic complications including severe insulin resistance and diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Between&#xD;
      2000 and 2014, the NIDDK IRP conducted an open-label clinical trial of the recombinant human&#xD;
      leptin analog, metreleptin, in patients with generalized and partial forms of lipodystrophy.&#xD;
      This study showed that metreleptin ameliorates metabolic and endocrine abnormalities in&#xD;
      lipodystrophy, including reducing food intake, improving insulin resistance and diabetes,&#xD;
      reducing ectopic lipid, and normalizing reproduction. Based on these data, metreleptin was&#xD;
      approved by the FDA in February, 2014, for patients with generalized, but not partial,&#xD;
      lipodystrophy. Our data have shown, however, that a subgroup of patients with partial&#xD;
      lipodystrophy do gain medical benefit from metreleptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is twofold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide access to metreleptin to patients with partial lipodystrophy who have&#xD;
           previously received and derived benefit from metreleptin through NIH studies (protocols&#xD;
           02-DK-0022 and 13-DK-0057).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To continue to collect data on the long-term efficacy of metreleptin in ameliorating the&#xD;
           metabolic complications of partial lipodystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metreleptin will be given at doses of less than or equal to 0.24 mg/kg/day, adjusted based on&#xD;
      body weight and metabolic control. Patients will be seen approximately once per year at NIH&#xD;
      for evaluation, and potentially less frequently for those who are medically stable and have&#xD;
      difficulty traveling to NIH. Laboratory evaluation will be obtained more frequently by the&#xD;
      patient s home providers as clinically indicated. The primary outcomes of the study are&#xD;
      improvements in serum triglycerides and hemoglobin A1c levels. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      measures of steatohepatitis and ectopic lipid, body composition, bone mineral density and&#xD;
      bone mineral metabolism, and pituitary and reproductive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metreleptin is supplied by Amryt Pharma, Incorporated. Neither the NIH nor Amryt Pharma can&#xD;
      guarantee that leptin will be available indefinitely and/or after the study ends.&#xD;
