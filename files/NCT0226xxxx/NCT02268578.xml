      Memory difficulty ranks among the most common complaints for patients with temporal lobe&#xD;
      epilepsy. While these cognitive problems may affect quality of life more than seizure&#xD;
      frequency, no effective therapy exists. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a&#xD;
      method of safe, noninvasive, and painless brain stimulation delivering low intensity direct&#xD;
      current through scalp electrodes to modulate brain activity. Several recently published&#xD;
      studies demonstrate the enhancement of working memory and mood with stimulation of the&#xD;
      frontal region of the brain. Furthermore, tDCS has never been reported to have induced a&#xD;
      seizure. The aim of our study is to determine whether real tDCS can improve memory function&#xD;
      and mood. The investigators are enrolling patients with well-controlled temporal lobe&#xD;
      epilepsy who have not undergone brain surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a powerful technique to modulate brain&#xD;
      activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDCS is based on the application of a weak direct current to the scalp that flows between two&#xD;
      relatively large electrodes-anode and cathode. During tDCS, low amplitude (1-2 mA), constant&#xD;
      currents are applied via the scalp electrodes and penetrate the skull to enter the brain.&#xD;
      Although there is substantial shunting of current in the scalp, sufficient current penetrates&#xD;
      the brain to modify the trans-membrane neuronal potential as shown by two recent modeling&#xD;
      studies (Miranda et al. 2006; Wagner et al. 2007a), and thus influence the level of&#xD;
      excitability and modulate the firing rate of individual neurons. When tDCS is applied for a&#xD;
      sufficient duration, cortical function can be altered beyond the stimulation period (Nitsche&#xD;
      and Paulus 2001) and the direction of the cortical excitability changes depends on current&#xD;
      orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several well-conducted animal studies on the effects of tDCS dating back to the 1950s and 60s&#xD;
      showed that tDCS is a powerful technique to modulate brain function. These studies&#xD;
      demonstrated that polarizing currents applied to the surface of the brain result in a&#xD;
      modulation of the cortical activity. Surface anodal polarization of the cortex increases&#xD;
      spontaneous unit discharges (Burns 1954; Creutzfeld et al. 1962) and initiates paroxysmal&#xD;
      activity (Goldring and O'Leary 1951), whereas cathodal polarization generally depresses these&#xD;
      events. Furthermore, low-level surface polarization facilitates acquisition of learned motor&#xD;
      responses and induces prolonged changes in patterns of evoked cortical unit discharges&#xD;
      (Bindman et al. 1964). Finally, Purpura et al. (1964), studying pyramidal tract cells from&#xD;
      cats, showed that prolonged periods of polarization may produce progressive membrane and&#xD;
      post-synaptic potential changes as well as after-effects (Purpura and McMurtry 1965).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this evidence, recent human studies have been performed and collectively have shown&#xD;
      that motor cortex (M1) stimulation with tDCS changes motor cortex excitability depending on&#xD;
      the stimulation polarity: while anodal stimulation increases cortical excitability, cathodal&#xD;
      stimulation decreases it (Nitsche et al. 2003; Nitsche and Paulus 2000; Nitsche and Paulus&#xD;
      2001). Similar modulatory effects have also been described in the visual cortex (Antal et al.&#xD;
      2004; Antal et al. 2001). A recent tDCS study has shown that anodal tDCS of the primary motor&#xD;
      cortex not only affects cortical activity, but induces significant changes on thalamic&#xD;
      activity (Lang et al. 2005). It should be noted that application of tDCS in humans has&#xD;
      advanced significantly in the last 10 years and it is therefore different from the human&#xD;
      application used in the '60s and '70s (Wagner et al. 2007b)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, tDCS offers several advantages as compared with other techniques of noninvasive&#xD;
      brain stimulation (i.e., repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)): (1) small size&#xD;
      of the electrodes and stimulator, thus allowing portable use for instance to be used at home,&#xD;
      (2) simple and non-expensive technique that can easily be translated for use in clinical&#xD;
      practice, (3) long-lasting effects - the modulatory effects of tDCS last longer as compared&#xD;
      to rTMS - for instance, 13 minutes of stimulation changes brain excitability for up to 2&#xD;
      hours (Nitsche and Paulus 2001), and (4) more easily blinded with sham tDCS in the setting of&#xD;
      clinical trials (Gandiga et al 2006)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prefrontal stimulation has been shown to enhance cognitive function:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several recently published studies demonstrating the enhancement of working&#xD;
      memory when tDCS stimulation is applied to the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Fregni et al&#xD;
      (2005) studied 15 normal subjects. The patients performed a three -back working memory task&#xD;
      during active anodal (stimulatory) tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left&#xD;
      DLPFC), sham stimulation over the left DLPFC, cathodal (inhibitory) stimulation of the left&#xD;
      DLPFC, or anodal stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1). The results of this study&#xD;
      showed a significant improvement in working memory as indexed by task accuracy after active&#xD;
      anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC. The other conditions of stimulation-including sham tDCS,&#xD;
      anodal tDCS of left DLPFC, or anodal tDCS of M1-did not result in a significant task&#xD;
      performance change. Similarly, Boggio et al (2007) have also found significant improvement in&#xD;
      affective go-no-go task performance in patients with severe depression after treatment with&#xD;
      anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC independent of the degree of mood enhancement after 10&#xD;
      consecutive days of tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, there has been some evidence that cathodal inhibition of the right DLPFC enhances&#xD;
      working memory performance in the same task in depressed patients (Bermpohl et al 2006).&#xD;
      Together these studies suggest that the increased activity of the left DLPFC-whether directly&#xD;
      through anodal stimulation or indirectly through cathodal inhibition of the right DLPFC-is&#xD;
      responsible for improvement in working memory performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has a significant antidepressant effect:&#xD;
      Modulation of prefrontal cortex with anodal tDCS is associated with a significant improvement&#xD;
      in depression. Initially a preliminary, randomized, controlled and double blind trial in&#xD;
      which the effects of five days of anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC in 10 patients with&#xD;
      major depression was investigated. All patients tolerated tDCS without complications. At the&#xD;
      end of treatment, there were 4 treatment responders in the active group versus no responders&#xD;
      in the sham group. The patients who received active stimulation had a significant decrease in&#xD;
      the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores&#xD;
      compared to baseline which was not observed in patients that received sham stimulation&#xD;
      (Fregni et al. 2006b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a follow-up, parallel-group, double-blind clinical trial with 40 patients with major&#xD;
      depression, patients were washed-out of their medications and randomized into three groups of&#xD;
      treatment: anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC (active group); anodal tDCS of the occipital cortex&#xD;
      (active control group) and sham tDCS (placebo control group). tDCS was applied for 10&#xD;
      sessions during a 2-week period. Mood was evaluated by a blinded rater using the HDRS and&#xD;
      BDI. The treatment was well tolerated with minimal side effects that were distributed equally&#xD;
      across all treatment groups. This study showed significantly larger reductions in depression&#xD;
      scores after left DLPFC tDCS (HDRS reduction of 40.4% (±25.8%)) as compared to occipital&#xD;
      (HDRS reduction of 21.3% (±12.9%)) and sham tDCS (HDRS reduction of 10.4% (±36.6%)). The&#xD;
      beneficial effects of tDCS in the DLPFC group persisted for 1 month after the end of&#xD;
      treatment (Boggio et al. 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, in another longitudinal study on depression by Rigonatti et al (2008), serial&#xD;
      applications of anodal (stimulatory) tDCS applied to the prefrontal cortex (10 sessions of 2&#xD;
      mA each) had a similar effect on reducing depressive symptoms as measured by Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory scores as fluoxetine even 6 weeks after treatment. However, the effects of tDCS&#xD;
      were more immediate than that of fluoxetine19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, tDCS of the left DLPFC seems to be able to induce significant positive affective&#xD;
      and cognitive improvements in normal patients and patients with significant depression. We&#xD;
      will therefore in this proposal test whether prolonged prefrontal stimulation is associated&#xD;
      with clinically meaningful changes in affective and cognitive function without worsening&#xD;
      epileptiform activity or seizure frequency. The results of this pilot study will have a&#xD;
      significant clinical impact for the treatment of the neuropsychiatric comorbidities of&#xD;
      patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.&#xD;
