    <textblock>
      The conceptual hypothesis of this study is that primary angioplasty is superior to a combined&#xD;
      strategy of immediate thrombolysis followed by routine angioplasty in patients with&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI), even with the inherent delay of the&#xD;
      transfer of these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label clinical trial comparing two strategies of&#xD;
      reperfusion in STEMI. Patients will be randomly allocated to: primary angioplasty or&#xD;
      post-thrombolysis angioplasty. A clinical follow-up will be performed at 12 months. In this&#xD;
      trial, 1444 patients with STEMI will be randomized to primary angioplasty with immediate&#xD;
      stent implantation in at least the infarct related artery (IRA) under bivalirudin protection,&#xD;
      or to a combined strategy of immediate thrombolysis with tenecteplase (TNK) and enoxaparin&#xD;
      followed by cardiac catheterization and adequate revascularization when indicated during the&#xD;
      next morning after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the clinical efficacy (incidence of the composite endpoint formed by death,&#xD;
      reinfarction, new revascularization, rehospitalization or severe hemorrhage within 12 months)&#xD;
      of primary angioplasty versus thrombolytic treatment followed by percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) the next day in patients with STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Components of the composite endpoint individually analysed at 12 months (death,&#xD;
           reinfarction, new revascularization, rehospitalization and severe hemorrhage).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular mortality and its different components (pre-specified in the case report&#xD;
           forms, CRF) at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of the composite endpoint formed by death, reinfarction, new&#xD;
           revascularization, rehospitalization and/or hemorrhage at 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of major bleeding events during hospitalization and at 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the clinical efficacy of both treatments according to the timing of&#xD;
           presentation after symptom onset (0 to 3 hours, &gt;3-6 hours, and &gt;6-12 hours), to the&#xD;
           patient´s age (&gt; or &lt; 75 years), to the infarction localization (anterior or inferior),&#xD;
           to gender (male or female), to the presence of diabetes mellitus and to the&#xD;
           characteristics of the recruiting center (with or without 24-hour catheterization&#xD;
           facilities).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of the composite endpoint formed by death, reinfarction, new&#xD;
           revascularization, rehospitalization and/or hemorrhage at 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Components of the composite endpoint individually analysed at 3 years (death,&#xD;
           reinfarction, new revascularization, rehospitalization and severe hemorrhage).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of stent thrombosis according to the Academic Research Consortium (ARC)&#xD;
           definition (http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/transcripts/2006-4253t2.rtf.) within&#xD;
           30 days, 12 months and 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the combination of death, reinfarction, revascularization, rehospitalization&#xD;
           and/or major hemorrhage of patients treated with primary angioplasty versus those&#xD;
           assigned to the postrombolysis angioplasty who underwent catheterization the following&#xD;
           day within 30 days, 12 months and 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare every indivicual components of the combine endpoint (death, reinfarction,&#xD;
           revascularization, rehospitalization and major hemorrhage) of patients treated with&#xD;
           primary angioplasty versus those assigned to the postrombolysis angioplasty who&#xD;
           underwent catheterization the following day within 30 days, 12 months and 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the cost-effectiveness relationship (cost of maintaining a patient alive and&#xD;
           without adverse cardiovascular events within the first year post-infarction) of both&#xD;
           strategies.&#xD;
