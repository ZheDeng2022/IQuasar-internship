      Patients in London and Hamilton with severe asthma who are deemed eligible by a respirologist&#xD;
      to undergo bronchial thermoplasty treatment will be randomized to image-guided or&#xD;
      conventional bronchial thermoplasty using hyperpolarized noble gas imaging.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a one year, single centre randomized controlled trial. Subjects will be identified&#xD;
      through the London Asthma Centre located at St. Joseph's Hospital and from Hamilton at St.&#xD;
      Joseph's Healthcare, and will be given a letter of information for the study. The study will&#xD;
      only recruit subjects with asthma who are undergoing BT as part of their normal clinical care&#xD;
      and asthma treatment plan. Those interested will sign the consent form at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a novel FDA approved outpatient asthma treatment procedure&#xD;
      which aims to &quot;cure&quot; symptoms by permanently reducing airway smooth muscle mass in the lobar&#xD;
      and segmental bronchi. Under local anesthetic, radiofrequency energy is delivered to warm the&#xD;
      airway wall to 65 degrees celcius. The effect of this procedure is a reduction in airway&#xD;
      smooth muscle mass in the treated airways resulting in a reduced potential for&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourteen asthma patients will be enrolled in the study and each subject will visit the centre&#xD;
      on five occasions (three pre-treatment visits and two post-treatment visits). We will&#xD;
      evaluate pre-therapy optimization using inflammometry, pre-therapy ventilation defect&#xD;
      reproducibility and BT treatment effects (pre-treatment visit 1= 5±2 days pre-optimization,&#xD;
      pre-treatment visit 2 = 15±7 days pre-BT, pre-treatment visit 3 = 5±2 days pre-BT,&#xD;
      post-treatment visit 4=6 weeks post-BT, post treatment visit 5 = 6 months post-BT). At&#xD;
      pre-treatment visit 1, patients will be randomized to image-guided or conventional therapy.&#xD;
      For all subjects, at all visits, spirometry, plethysmography and 3He and/or 129Xe MRI will be&#xD;
      performed. Methacholine challenge (MCh) will be performed (for those subjects with FEV1 &gt;60%)&#xD;
      at pre-treatment visit 3 and post-treatment visit 4 with spirometry and MRI performed pre-&#xD;
      and post-MCh. Pre-treatment visit 3 will include a low-dose thoracic CT that will be used to&#xD;
      generate a detailed 3D model of the airway tree. MRI will be co-registered to the CT with 3D&#xD;
      airway rendering to enable spatial comparisons between ventilation defects and airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will also complete bi-weekly and weekly quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
      Self-reported data will be uploaded by each subject monthly to our website using a&#xD;
      confidential and password protected upload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI of the lungs will be performed using an inhaled contrast agent: either Hyperpolarized&#xD;
      Helium-3 or Hyperpolarized Xenon-129. Participants will inhale the hyperpolarized gas and&#xD;
      perform a breathhold for up to 16 seconds. Two different types of images will be acquired in&#xD;
      the coronal plain during each visit: 1) 1H thoracic cavity, and 2) 3He and/or 129Xe static&#xD;
      ventilation. Respiration and oxygen saturation will be monitored throughout the imaging&#xD;
      session.&#xD;

    <description>At pre-treatment Visit 3, imaging data will be acquired to generate a patient-specific bronchial thermoplasty treatment plan which will include 15-20 target airways, prioritized in order of importance and grouped by lobe, to be targeted during a single session BT treatment procedure. Airways demonstrating dynamic or static bronchoconstriction will be targeted for BT treatment based on their spacial proximity to ventilation defects.</description>
