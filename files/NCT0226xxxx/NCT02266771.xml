      The objective to this study is to determine the effectiveness of V.A.C.Veraflo negative&#xD;
      pressure wound therapy with instillation, when compared to historical controls of V.A.C&#xD;
      Therapy without instillation in the management of wounds.&#xD;

      The V.A.C.Ulta™ Negative Pressure Wound Therapy System is a 510(k) -cleared, Class II device&#xD;
      (K100657) with the following indication for use: &quot;the V.A.C.Ulta™ Negative Pressure Wound&#xD;
      Therapy System is an integrated wound management system that provides Negative Pressure Wound&#xD;
      Therapy with an instillation option. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in the absence of&#xD;
      instillation is intended to create an environment that promotes wound healing by secondary or&#xD;
      tertiary (delayed primary) intention by preparing the wound bed for closure, reducing edema,&#xD;
      promoting granulation tissue formation and perfusion, and by removing exudates and infectious&#xD;
      material. The instillation option is indicated for patients who would benefit from vacuum&#xD;
      assisted drainage and controlled delivery of topical wound treatment solutions and&#xD;
      suspensions over the wound bed. The V.A.C.Ulta™ Negative Pressure Wound Therapy System, with&#xD;
      and without instillation, is indicated for patients with chronic, acute, traumatic, sub-acute&#xD;
      and dehisced wounds, partial-thickness burns, ulcers (such as diabetic, pressure and venous&#xD;
      insufficiency), flaps and grafts&quot;. The V.A.C. Ulta™ Therapy Unit is for use with only V.A.C.®&#xD;
      Dressings (V.A.C.® GranuFoam™, V.A.C. GranuFoam Silver®, V.A.C. WhiteFoam,® V.A.C. VeraFlo™&#xD;
      Dressing Systems) and disposables. The V.A.C. VeraFlo™ Dressing System is intended for use&#xD;
      with V.A.C. VeraFlo™ Therapy as provided by the V.A.C.Ulta™ Therapy Unit. The V.A.C. VeraFlo™&#xD;
      Dressing was cleared under the V.A.C Ulta™ Negative Pressure Wound Therapy System 510(k)&#xD;
      (K100657). It is recommended for use with open wounds, including wounds with shallow&#xD;
      undermining or tunnel areas where the distal aspect is visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution is a clear, odorless, colorless solution consisting of&#xD;
      polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), betaine, sodium hydroxide and purified water. PHMB, also&#xD;
      known as Polyhexanide, is a polymer biguanide. PHMB is a cationic preservative which inhibits&#xD;
      the growth of microorganisms within the product. Betaine is a zwitterionic (both, negatively&#xD;
      and positively charged) surfactant. Prontosan® is a FDA 510(k) cleared device intended for&#xD;
      cleaning wounds and for moistening and lubricating absorbent wound dressings for ulcers,&#xD;
      burns, post surgical wounds, and abrasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective to this study is to determine the effectiveness of V.A.C.Veraflo negative&#xD;
      pressure wound therapy with Prontosan instillation, when compared to historical controls of&#xD;
      V.A.C Therapy without instillation in the management of wounds. We will measure any&#xD;
      difference in length of hospital stay, number of days until final surgical procedure, and the&#xD;
      number of trips to the or for additional debridement. Patients will be considered infection&#xD;
      free when clinical signs of infection are absent and lab values become normal.&#xD;
