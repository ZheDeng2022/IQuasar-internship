    <textblock>
      Essential to laparoscopic operations is adequate visualization. Unfortunately there is no&#xD;
      grading system to assess the degree or quality of visualization. There are many contributing&#xD;
      factors that either assist or hinder the quality. Compared to open surgical procedures,&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgical procedures (Laparo-endoscopic Single Site (LESS) and conventional&#xD;
      multiport) are associated with less postoperative pain, a lower wound infection rate, shorter&#xD;
      length of hospital stays and reduced incidence of late ventral hernia(1). Despite these well&#xD;
      documented benefits of laparoscopic procedures, laparoscopy in certain patient populations&#xD;
      can be challenging. Preoperative factors that contribute to technical difficulty in&#xD;
      performance of laparoscopic procedures include male gender, android body habitus, and body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2(2). Men often have an android body habitus, whereby&#xD;
      the excess body fat concentrates within the peritoneal cavity, increases intra-abdominal&#xD;
      pressure and thus reduces intraoperative laparoscopic visualization. Intra-abdominal pressure&#xD;
      measured in morbidly obese patients is 2-3 times higher than in non-obese patients. In&#xD;
      addition, android body habitus and high BMI are often associated with an enlarged left lobe&#xD;
      of the liver. These factors can contribute to the degree of intraoperative technical&#xD;
      difficulty and should be weighed in selection of appropriate patients to undergo laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly in the early period of the surgeon's learning curve, we suggest that selection&#xD;
      criteria for laparoscopic procedures for the upper abdomen be limited to patients with a low&#xD;
      BMI and no previous upper abdominal surgery. Although low BMI is a relatively good predictor&#xD;
      of a less challenging laparoscopic procedure, a high BMI does not necessarily predict&#xD;
      intraoperative technical difficulty. We predict that the best method to determine the&#xD;
      technical difficulty of laparoscopic procedures is during intraoperative evaluation. For&#xD;
      example, the primary limiting factor in determining the technical difficulty of laparoscopic&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is the size and thickness of the left lobe of the liver. A&#xD;
      massively enlarged left lobe of the liver obscures the laparoscopic view of the&#xD;
      gastro-esophageal junction and angle of His, making the gastrojejunal anastomosis difficult&#xD;
      to construct. Schwartz et al. support this concept when they found that a large liver was the&#xD;
      primary reason for conversion from laparoscopic to open RYGBP in an analysis of 1,000&#xD;
      patients (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A laparoscopic operation consists of making small punctures into the peritoneum, through&#xD;
      which, a camera and surgical instruments are subsequently inserted. The laparoscopically&#xD;
      placed camera is the only view of the operative field. Since this point of view is constantly&#xD;
      changing to meet the surgeon's needs during the operation, and because it is very different&#xD;
      from the exoscopic view of the surgeon, the surgeon has to be very well trained to interpret&#xD;
      the images through the laparoscopic view. For LESS operations, a deflectable tip laparoscope&#xD;
      is utilized in aiding the surgeon for improved visibility and less clashing of instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laparoscopic view does not reveal, at one time, all the structures the surgeon needs to&#xD;
      see in order to complete the surgical procedure with success. These structures can, for&#xD;
      instance, be hidden behind the peritoneal wall (e.g., the ureter). This limitation cannot&#xD;
      only lead to a less efficient operation, but can also lead to complications. Often such&#xD;
      structures can be extracted from preoperative CT/MR images; however, the surgeon needs to&#xD;
      interpret and fuse these images with the laparoscopic view. To alleviate this problem, we&#xD;
      propose a laparoscopic visualization scoring system based on the intraoperative quality of&#xD;
      images (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of muscle relaxants on the isolated abdominal wall or diaphragmatic behavior and&#xD;
      the absolute intra-abdominal volume are difficult to measure. Conversely, the inflated&#xD;
      volume-pressure relationship of the abdominal cavity is easier to measure. A description of&#xD;
      this volume-pressure relationship has not been identified in previous studies. Clinical data&#xD;
      supports a positive linear correlation between the depth of neuromuscular blockade and&#xD;
      abdominal wall and diaphragmatic relaxation and compliance (4). There is a very tangible and&#xD;
      real effect of the neuromuscular blockade; this ultimately has a direct impact on the quality&#xD;
      of visualization of the surgical field during a laparoscopic procedure (5). A constant&#xD;
      neuromuscular block leads to preferable working conditions for the surgeon. The evoked muscle&#xD;
      responses after neurostimulation can be registered by electromyography (EMG),&#xD;
      mechanomyography (MMG) and acceleromyography (AMG). In principle, different peripheral nerves&#xD;
      can be used for neurostimulation. The EMG records the electrical signal generated by the&#xD;
      muscular action potential under its surface electrodes. The force of the thumb after&#xD;
      stimulation can be registered by MMG. The AMG records the acceleration of the thumb after&#xD;
      neurostimulation. The EMG, MMG and AMG system allows for observation of the measured signals&#xD;
      quantity and quality (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have identified other relevant factors that significantly affect the quality of&#xD;
      visualization during different laparoscopic procedures including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clarity, focus and brightness:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The laparoscope typically consists of an outer ring of optical fibers used to transmit&#xD;
           light into the body, and an inner core of rod lenses that illuminate visual scene. This&#xD;
           is then relayed back to the camera. Various different types of laparoscopes are&#xD;
           available; they are specified in terms of overall length, number of rods, diameter and&#xD;
           angle of view. Generally speaking, the wider the scope the brighter the resulting image.&#xD;
           Lenses are available in the range of 1.9mm to 12mm, but sizes of 5mm and 10mm are the&#xD;
           most common choices for pediatric and adult patients, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Breadth of intra-abdominal field and vertical space measured in centimeters:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Breadth of intra-abdominal field and vertical space are factors directly related to&#xD;
           pressure insufflation as well as the level of the neuromuscular blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Distracting factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This specific category of distracting factors includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Blood: the presence, especially in large quantities, may prevent adequate&#xD;
                visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Smoke: unipolar electrocautery and/or the bipolar Maryland forceps produce smoke&#xD;
                when used. The rate of aspiration and evacuation also affect visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Adhesions: the presence of intra-abdominal adhesions, which hinders and prohibits&#xD;
                proper identification of the anatomic structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Sterile iodine impregnated covering sheet: its application presumably has a&#xD;
                negative impact on abdominal wall and diaphragmatic compliance, and therefore, may&#xD;
                obscure visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Intra-intestinal air: the presence of air inside the stomach, and small and large&#xD;
                intestines adversely affects the size of the visual field. This can be prevented by&#xD;
                an adequate preoperative bowel preparation and placement of an aspiration NG tube&#xD;
                during anesthesia induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient's specific factors such as BMI value and body habitus:&#xD;
&#xD;
           From our experience, a BMI under 26 allows for optimal field visualization. Conversely,&#xD;
           a BMI greater than 26 negatively impacts the visual field. However, a recent study&#xD;
           conducted by Camani et al. in 2010 showed that the laparoscopic approach in the various&#xD;
           applications of gynecologic surgery is not significantly influenced by BMI in terms of&#xD;
           surgical outcomes, laparotomy conversion rate, intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
           complication rate, and duration of hospital stay (4). We feel that visualization during&#xD;
           operations involving the abdominal cavity are adversely affected by high amounts of&#xD;
           adipose tissue, and therefore, a visualization scoring system will help support this&#xD;
           theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Type of disorder (malignant vs. benign) that the laparoscopic procedure is undertaken&#xD;
           for:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to many pathologic factors such as the need for R0 resections, the discovery of more&#xD;
           advanced disease than anticipated, the presence of adhesions or scar tissue from&#xD;
           previous operations, laparoscopic procedures for malignant disorders may require a&#xD;
           better visualization field than laparoscopic procedures undertaken for benign disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Inadequate and/or poorly designed instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Most laparoscopic instrument development is technology-driven. This approach to&#xD;
           instrument design does not always consider the ergonomics of the users, therefore&#xD;
           leading to a user-unfriendly product (4, 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Technical difficulties:&#xD;
&#xD;
           An intraoperative technical difficulty is defined as a significant deviation from the&#xD;
           ordinary surgical procedure. All conversions to an open operation and iatrogenic bowel&#xD;
           perforation during laparoscopic surgery are examples of technical difficulties. Many&#xD;
           studies demonstrate that a technical difficulty during laparoscopic-assisted surgery&#xD;
           jeopardizes both the intra-operative and postoperative patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patient's body position during laparoscopic procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study led by Mulier, J et al. in 2010 demonstrated that the Trendelenburg position for&#xD;
      lower abdominal surgery and reverse Trendelenburg with flexing of the legs at the hips for&#xD;
      upper abdominal surgery effectively improved the workspace in obese patients, even with full&#xD;
      muscle relaxation (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Objectives A.Primary Objective The primary objective is to develop a laparoscopic&#xD;
      visualization scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine how visualization is affected by various levels of pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
           correlated with neuromuscular blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify the factors that influence visualization, and determine how to manage these&#xD;
           factors to optimize visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if there is a statistically significant correlation between different degrees&#xD;
           of visualization and the following intraoperative time intervals:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. surgical incision to sterile wound dressing&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. sterile wound dressing to extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. sterile wound dressing to patient exiting operating room&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine if there is a statistically significant correlation between different degrees&#xD;
           of visualization and postoperative pain.&#xD;
