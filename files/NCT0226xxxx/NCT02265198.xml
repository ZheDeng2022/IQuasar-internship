  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary contusion (PC) is a significant problem after blunt trauma that may often lead to&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in some patients, death. Although the&#xD;
      pathophysiology is incompletely understood, it is clear that there is a biochemical process&#xD;
      involving changes in the inflammatory milieu after contusion which occurs in addition to&#xD;
      simple direct mechanical injury to the lung. The relationship of severity of contusion on&#xD;
      imaging, disturbances in the inflammatory phenotype, and outcome is unknown. This is a&#xD;
      prospective, observational study which will evaluate the size and severity of contusion as&#xD;
      measured on chest computed tomography (CT). Inflammatory mediators will be measured in the&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in the serum of patients with pulmonary contusion to define&#xD;
      the inflammatory nature of the post-contusion lung. The degree of abnormality within the&#xD;
      inflammatory parameters will be correlated with lung contusion size and subsequent patient&#xD;
      outcomes. These data will be compared to other patient groups: 1) Trauma patients without&#xD;
      chest injury who are mechanically ventilated; 2) Uninjured patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      surgical procedures that will require intubation and mechanical ventilation; 3) Patients in&#xD;
      the Medical ICU who are mechanically ventilated with acute respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis tested within this study is resolution of lung injury is dependent upon the&#xD;
      presence of Tregs in the alveolar space.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center and will enroll&#xD;
      40 patients in the PC study group, 20 patients in each control group, and 20 MICU patients.&#xD;
      Recruitment will occur over two years. The sample size was determined by identifying the mean&#xD;
      number of patients with PC admitted (38) to WFUBMC per year. Using Whittemore's formula, this&#xD;
      sample size will be adequate to detect a significant odds ratio of 5 (alpha &lt;0.05) with&#xD;
      respect to increase in acute lung injury or ARDS risk in patients with &gt; 20 % total lung&#xD;
      volume contusion with approximately 85% power. The odds ratio for this population in&#xD;
      developing acute lung injury or ARDS in a previous study was 16.666. Eligible subjects for&#xD;
      study group will be patients with PC on admission CT; eligible subjects for control group #1&#xD;
      (CG1) are non-injured patients without PC undergoing a standard general surgical procedure;&#xD;
      eligible subjects for control group #2 (CG2) are non-chest, non-PC trauma patients who are&#xD;
      admitted intubated to the trauma ICU; eligible MICU subjects are patients on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation admitted to the Medical ICU with acute respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent for study group, CG2, and the MICU group will generally be obtained from&#xD;
      family members as most patients will be unconscious or sedated. If the patient is alert, the&#xD;
      study will be explained to both the patient and family. Informed consent for CG1 will be&#xD;
      obtained from the patient and family members in Surgery Clinic prior to elective procedures.&#xD;
      An initial blood sample will be obtained on all persons in the study group, CG2, and, if the&#xD;
      patient is ventilated, a BAL will be obtained after signing of the informed consent by the&#xD;
      patient or LAR. Blood samples and pulmonary samples will be obtained on CG1 patients after&#xD;
      obtaining signed informed consent, in the operating theater, after they are sedated and&#xD;
      intubated, though before their elective procedure. Blood and pulmonary samples will be&#xD;
      obtained from MICU subjects after obtaining signed informed consent.&#xD;
