      This phase II trial studies intermittent dosing of BRAF inhibitor LGX818 (encorafenib) and&#xD;
      MEK inhibitor MEK 162 (binimetinib) in treating patients with melanoma that has spread to&#xD;
      other parts of the body (metastatic) and have a BRAF V600 mutation. LGX818 and MEK162 may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking different enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      LGX818 and MEK162 with breaks between each course (intermittently) may help delay the time&#xD;
      when tumors become resistant to the drugs.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. One year progression free survival (PFS) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain biopsy samples from patients treated with an intermittent schedule of LGX818 and&#xD;
      MEK162 to study adaptive and acquired resistance as well as melanoma evolutionary patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Study molecular changes of adaptive resistance and acquired resistance to LGX818 and&#xD;
      MEK162 in circulating melanoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study plasma samples for circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), microribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (microRNA) and protein signatures of adaptive resistance and acquired resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore the median progression free survival and overall survival of patients receiving&#xD;
      an intermittent schedule of LGX818 and MEK162.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive LGX818 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and MEK162 PO twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      continuously for 8 weeks, followed by intermittent dosing in subsequent cycles (3 weeks off&#xD;
      therapy, 5 weeks on therapy). Cycles repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
