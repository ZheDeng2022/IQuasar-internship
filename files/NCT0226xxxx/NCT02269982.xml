  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop a first-in-man CTC-based molecular taxonomy of CRPC in the context of&#xD;
      novel AR-directed therapies, categorize different patterns of resistance in this disease&#xD;
      setting, and describe their evolution over time and treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will construct a multi-center clinical database of men before and after treatment&#xD;
      with abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and taxane chemotherapy, and will comprehensively&#xD;
      analyze CTC DNA for copy gains/losses and whole exome sequencing for acquired mutations, CTC&#xD;
      RNA for AR-variants and evidence of epithelial plasticity, and plasma circulating tumor DNA&#xD;
      (ctDNA) for whole exome sequencing. Significantly, the investigators will pair the presence&#xD;
      of key proposed circulating biomarkers of treatment resistance with patient outcomes on these&#xD;
      systemic therapies for the purpose of developing predictive biomarkers that may have direct&#xD;
      clinical utility in guiding choice of therapies. It is proposed that specific AR-v's (i.e.&#xD;
      AR-v7), biomarkers of epithelial plasticity, and microtubule interacting protein variants&#xD;
      will convey docetaxel resistance and be enriched in men failing abiraterone acetate or&#xD;
      enzalutamide, while other AR genomic events (AR amplification, AR-v567es, AR mutations, GR&#xD;
      overexpression) will be responsive to taxane chemotherapy. This work represents a&#xD;
      first-in-field comprehensive analysis of CTC molecular profiles for the development of a CTC&#xD;
      molecular taxonomy of mCRPC.&#xD;
