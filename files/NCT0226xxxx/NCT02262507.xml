    <textblock>
      Significant morbidity, mortality, and related costs are caused by traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI). A simple, effective, and lightweight device worn by athletes or war fighters in the&#xD;
      field, designed to mitigate TBI resulting from blast trauma or concussive events, would save&#xD;
      lives, and the huge costs currently being experienced for life-treatment of surviving&#xD;
      victims. An externally-worn medical device that applies mild jugular compression according to&#xD;
      the principle of the Queckenstedt Maneuver (the Device) is being developed by Q30 Labs, LLC&#xD;
      (Q30). Initial research suggests that the Device has the potential to reduce the likelihood&#xD;
      of TBI. The rationale for testing wideband absorbance and Oto-acoustics emissions (OAE) is&#xD;
      that the investigators need a physiologic, non-invasive method to evaluate the brain&#xD;
      responses to mild jugular compression across multiple age groups. To determine this with MR&#xD;
      imaging is currently cost prohibitive. The investigators pilot data from the parent IRB&#xD;
      indicates a consistent response measured via wideband absorbance in young adults. Therefore,&#xD;
      a preliminary step to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the neck collar device is to employ&#xD;
      this technology across a wide range of ages.&#xD;

      For the testing sessions, subjects may either come to our testing site or the investigators&#xD;
      may bring the testing to their location (e.g. schools, work). The subjects will be fitted&#xD;
      with a device around your neck, like a neck tie. The Device incorporates two bulges localized&#xD;
      over the site of the internal jugular veins bilaterally. Experiments performed with jugular&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound demonstrate that while wearing the Device, flows within the jugular veins&#xD;
      are reduced, while flow within the carotid arteries and all portions of the cerebrum are&#xD;
      preserved (JA Fisher, unpublished data). Thus, application of the Device to the subject will&#xD;
      not cause any untoward health risks (IRB# 2013-2240 safety testing performed on this Device).&#xD;
      The pressure exerted by the Device on the region of the neck superficial to the internal&#xD;
      jugular vein is akin to the pressure felt when a person yawns or wears a snugly fitting&#xD;
      necktie. The methods are utilized in prior approved IRB (2013-2240)..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Station I: Consent to Participate Each participant will review the Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      approved consent to participate form prior to data collection. They will be given an adequate&#xD;
      amount of time to ask questions to the study coordinator, or the person obtaining consent,&#xD;
      and then make their decision to participate or not participate. If they wish to participate,&#xD;
      they will be asked to sign the informed consent form. For middle school and high school&#xD;
      subjects recruited via the investigators relationship with the schools, this station will be&#xD;
      designated to review consent and assent forms to ensure that proper signatures have been&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Station II: Device Fitting and Ultrasound The subjects will be outfitted with the device by a&#xD;
      staff member appropriately trained in fitting the device in the proper location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Station III: Wideband Absorbance and Oto-Acoustic Emissions This station will help determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the device by measuring the auditory response of a clicking noise that&#xD;
      will be non-invasively imparted into the subject's outer ear. For both tests, a soft silicone&#xD;
      tip is placed into the outer ear, and sounds are delivered via a miniature speaker. For the&#xD;
      wideband absorbance test, absorbed acoustic responses will be monitored to provide&#xD;
      information on the operation of the collar device. These are measured as changes in the&#xD;
      acoustic absorbance of the ear. For the oto-acoustic emission test, tones or clicks will be&#xD;
      presented to the ear with the same soft ear probe and recording microphones pick up the&#xD;
      oto-acoustic emission coming back from the outer hair cells of the inner ear. The computer&#xD;
      averages and processes the responses in reference to a noise floor across a specified&#xD;
      frequency range, displaying the results on the computer screen for the tester. The&#xD;
      oto-acoustic emissions test also provides a brief hearing screening to determine if hearing&#xD;
      is normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence indicates that wideband absorbance and oto-acoustic emissions will be altered with&#xD;
      increased intracranial pressure, thus this simple, non-invasive exam will provide feedback on&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the wideband absorbance and oto-acoustic emissions testing the study participants will&#xD;
      also be fitted with a compressive circumferential neck collar which can provide variable and&#xD;
      specific levels of pressure. The pressure is achieved by inflatable pods that sit adjacent to&#xD;
      the trachea affixed to a non-stretch adjustable collar. Manual inflation is regulated and&#xD;
      monitored by an experience operator/ technician through a bulb style pump and an electronic&#xD;
      gauge. Testing will occur without pressure and then with pressures applied up to 40mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Station IV: Hearing Assessment Otoscopy will be performed by an audiologist to note any ear&#xD;
      blockages, such as wax or drainage for exclusion purposes. The oto-acoustic emissions test&#xD;
      will be interpreted to determine if normal responses were obtained in each ear. If abnormal,&#xD;
      a hearing screening using pure tone audiometry screening will be provided free of charge. In&#xD;
      the event that the hearing screening is determined to be abnormal, the subject will receive&#xD;
      the results which may be shared with their primary care provider to determine any need for&#xD;
      referral for follow-up. If a subject is seen for follow-up at CCHMC following an abnormal&#xD;
      hearing assessment, this visit and any follow up visits will not be paid for by this project&#xD;
      and will be subject to insurance billing.&#xD;
