    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain data on the safety and manageability of applying LABS™&#xD;
      to the uterus and other areas of surgical trauma in the pelvis and abdomen following&#xD;
      laparoscopic gynaecologic surgery. In addition, performance data following a clinical&#xD;
      indicated second look laparoscopy will be collected for the purpose of determining sample&#xD;
      size predictions for future trials.&#xD;

      Women undergoing laparoscopic uterine myomectomy, adhesiolysis, treatment of endometriosis or&#xD;
      ovarian cystectomy with associated adhesions and/or endometriosis, and planned, clinically&#xD;
      indicated second look laparoscopy within 4-12 weeks will be enrolled into one of two sub&#xD;
      studies in which the major component of the surgery (as determined by the surgeon) was due&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Myomectomy Or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Other Gynaecology Pathology (repeat myomectomy, adhesiolysis, and/or treatment of&#xD;
           endometriosis, ovarian cystectomy with associated adhesions or endometriotic pathology,&#xD;
           removal of adenomyoma without myomectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The myomectomy sub study will include two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pure Myomectomy -myomectomy with no endometriosis and no adhesions/few filmy uterine&#xD;
           adhesions - blunt dissection only&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hybrid Myomectomy - myomectomy with (+/-) adhesions and/or (+/-) endometriosis and/or&#xD;
           (+/-) adenomyomectomy Patients in each sub study (1 or 2) and each arm of the myomectomy&#xD;
           study (a or b) will be randomized to receive LABS™ following their laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
           or current standard of care: surgery only control. All patients will be blinded to their&#xD;
           treatment status until study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study and sub-group allocation as well as randomisation will occur once the initial&#xD;
      laparoscopy is completed but before removal of the laparoscope. Myomectomy patients&#xD;
      randomized to receive LABS™ will then have the device sprayed to the entire surface of the&#xD;
      uterus and other areas of surgical trauma. In all treated patients all sites of surgical&#xD;
      trauma should be completely covered with LABS™ allowing a sprayed margin of at least 3 cm&#xD;
      around the operated or traumatised site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving LABS™ will be compared to patients who have had the current standard of&#xD;
      care: surgery alone. In addition to an overall comparison, they will be compared to patients&#xD;
      in the same sub study (1 or 2) and same arm of the myomectomy study (1a or 1b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first two patients entered by each operating surgeon will be allocated to LABS™ and&#xD;
      assessed for the application of LABS™. They will not be counted as fully evaluable randomized&#xD;
      patients. These patients will be sequentially assigned and evaluated. With confirmatory&#xD;
      evaluation of and application of LABS™ on the first patient, the surgeon will be advised to&#xD;
      assign the second. With the same confirmatory evaluation on the second patient and both&#xD;
      patients discharged from hospital the surgeon will be permitted to proceed with the study and&#xD;
      randomise patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the initial laparoscopic procedure and the clinically indicated second look laparoscopy&#xD;
      will be video recorded to allow for a blinded evaluation of LABS™ application and a separate&#xD;
      blinded evaluation of adhesions and other pathology in all patients - treated and controls.&#xD;
      This evaluation will be cross checked with the operating surgeon's own evaluations and&#xD;
      reconciled according to a specified protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where, during initial surgery, a second look laparoscopy is no longer considered clinically&#xD;
      indicated but the surgeon randomizes the patient, they will be followed for safety&#xD;
      evaluations only.&#xD;
