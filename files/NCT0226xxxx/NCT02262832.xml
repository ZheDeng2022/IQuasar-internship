      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Generalized lipodystrophy can cause high blood fat levels and resistance to insulin. This&#xD;
      can lead to health problems including diabetes. Researchers have found that the drug&#xD;
      metreleptin improves health in people with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of metreleptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People ages 6 months and older with generalized lipodystrophy who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have received metreleptin through NIH studies AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cannot get it through approved or compassionate use mechanisms in their home country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will come to NIH approximately every 6 months during year one, then every 1&#xD;
           2 years. Financial assistance may be available for travel within the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visits, participants will get a supply of metreleptin to take home for daily&#xD;
           injections. They will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  plastic catheter placed in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood tests, urine collection, and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oral glucose tolerance test, drinking a sweet liquid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ultrasound of the heart, liver, uterus, and ovaries. A gel and a probe are placed on the&#xD;
           skin and pictures are taken of the organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  echocardiogram, which takes pictures of the heart with sound waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting Metabolic Rate taken. A plastic hood is worn over the head while the oxygen they&#xD;
           breathe is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have up to 3 DEXA scan x-rays per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  annual bone x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  liver biopsies every few years. A needle will be inserted into the liver to obtain a&#xD;
           small piece. Participants will sign a separate consent for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be seen regularly by their local doctors and have blood tests at least&#xD;
           every 3 6 months at home.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that can be thought of as a signal from adipose tissue&#xD;
      to the rest of the body conveying information about long-term nutritional status. Patients&#xD;
      with the very rare condition of generalized lipodystrophy have leptin deficiency secondary to&#xD;
      lack of adipose tissue. The combination of leptin deficiency and ectopic lipid deposition in&#xD;
      patients with lipodystrophy leads to metabolic complications including severe insulin&#xD;
      resistance and diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and polycystic&#xD;
      ovarian syndrome. Between 2000 and 2014, the NIDDK IRP conducted an open-label clinical trial&#xD;
      of the recombinant human leptin analog, metreleptin, in patients with generalized and partial&#xD;
      forms of lipodystrophy. This study showed that metreleptin ameliorates metabolic and&#xD;
      endocrine abnormalities in lipodystrophy, including reducing food intake, improving insulin&#xD;
      resistance and diabetes, reducing ectopic lipid, and normalizing reproduction. Based on these&#xD;
      data, metreleptin was approved by the FDA in February, 2014, for patients with generalized,&#xD;
      but not partial, lipodystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, metreleptin is not available as an approved drug outside the US and Japan, and it&#xD;
      is available on a compassionate use basis only in a few additional countries. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is twofold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To provide access to metreleptin to patients with generalized lipodystrophy, including&#xD;
           those who have previously received metreleptin through NIH studies (protocols 02-DK-0022&#xD;
           and 13-DK- 0057) AND/OR who cannot obtain metreleptin through approved or compassionate&#xD;
           use mechanisms in their home country&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To continue to collect data on the long-term efficacy of metreleptin in ameliorating the&#xD;
           metabolic complications of generalized lipodystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metreleptin will be given at doses of less than or equal to 0.24 mg/kg/day, adjusted based on&#xD;
      body weight and metabolic control. Patients will be seen approximately once per year at NIH&#xD;
      for evaluation, and potentially less frequently for those who are medically stable and have&#xD;
      difficulty traveling to the US. Laboratory evaluation will be obtained more frequently by the&#xD;
      patient s home providers as clinically indicated. The primary outcomes of the study are&#xD;
      improvements in serum triglycerides and hemoglobin A1c levels. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      measures of steatohepatitis and ectopic lipid, body composition, bone mineral density and&#xD;
      bone mineral metabolism, and pituitary and reproductive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metreleptin is supplied by Amryt Pharma. Neither the NIH nor Amryt Pharma can guarantee that&#xD;
      leptin will be available for these patients indefinitely and/or after the study ends.&#xD;
