      pulmonary hypertension from twelve centers across four countries; South Africa, Mozambique,&#xD;
      Cameroon, Nigeria. The main aim of the study is to describe the aetiology, natural history&#xD;
      and management practices of pulmonary hypertension in Africa.&#xD;

      Title: Implementation of the PAPUCO Registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background to PAPUCO Registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sub-Saharan Task Force on Pulmonary Hypertension, under the leadership of Dr Ana Olga&#xD;
      Mocumbi and Prof. Sliwa, was established in January 2010. The primary aim of this Task Force&#xD;
      was to establish a Sub-Saharan African Registry of Pulmonary Hypertension (PHT) and,&#xD;
      subsequently, other research and educational awareness projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHT is a devastating, progressive disease, with increasingly debilitating symptoms and,&#xD;
      usually, shortened overall life expectancy. The epidemiology of PHT in Sub-Saharan Africa has&#xD;
      not yet been determined, but limited reports suggest that the incidence is higher that than&#xD;
      reported from developing countries, owing to the pattern of diseases prevalent in the region.&#xD;
      Many known factors for PHT are hyperendemic in this part of the world, including Human&#xD;
      Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, schistosomiasis, chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B and C and Sickle Cell Disease. On the other hand, a high prevalence of&#xD;
      tuberculosis, poorly treated asthma, high levels of pollution in urban areas and exposure to&#xD;
      mining, subsequently leads to various forms of pulmonary hypertension and, often, to right&#xD;
      heart failure with premature death. Lack of adequate paediatric services to deal with&#xD;
      congenital heart disease that leads to pulmonary hypertension, and secondary pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, is commonly seen, due to the high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease and&#xD;
      endomyocardial fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, more detailed information is currently not available, thus also leading to poor&#xD;
      awareness of those devastating problems, not only in Sub-Saharan Africa, but worldwide. There&#xD;
      is, therefore, an urgent need for research into the demographics, natural history and&#xD;
      survival of patients with pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Filling these gaps in knowledge is needed to effectively detect, manage and prevent pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension in this region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first Sub-Saharan Pulmonary Vascular Hypertension Workshop took place on Friday 23rd and&#xD;
      Saturday 24th April 2010, at the Hatter Cardiovascular Research Institute, Chris Barnard&#xD;
      Building, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town. We had colleagues from South&#xD;
      Africa, Africa (Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Nigeria, Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania), United Kingdom (Prof&#xD;
      Butrous), Australia (Prof Simon Stewart) and USA (Dr Lori Blauwet) participating in the&#xD;
      workshop. The areas of discipline of the participating members ranged from basic scientists,&#xD;
      adult and paediatric cardiologists, pulmonologists to cardiothoracic surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We used the workshop to plan a PHT registry in Africa, under the auspices of the Pulmonary&#xD;
      Vascular Research Institute-Sub-Saharan Taskforce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this research is to describe the epidemiology of pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      among patients attending referral units for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases in African&#xD;
      countries. This information will be crucial to the development of effective and&#xD;
      resource-sensitive strategies to tackle PHT in Sub-Saharan Africa. The first step in this&#xD;
      direction will be to build a registry of patients with PHT, attending a range of hospitals in&#xD;
      several countries from this region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To describe the epidemiology and characteristics of pulmonary hypertension in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      250 patients with pulmonary hypertension (PHT) who reside in sub-Saharan Africa will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participating center will enroll a minimum of twenty five consecutive patients based on&#xD;
      the following eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry aims to recruit consecutive patients with&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. newly diagnosed PH-based clinical and ECHO criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. who are able or likely to return for a 6-month follow-up,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. who are at least 18 years old (except for those in paediatric centres in Mozambique and&#xD;
           Nigeria) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. who consented in writing to participate in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centre eligibility includes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. availability of ECHO and training in asses- sing right heart function,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. experience in diagnosing PH according to the WHO classiﬁcation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. experience in clinical management of patients with RHF and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. resources to review patients at 6-month follow-up. Participating centres will be invited&#xD;
           to join the registry at African cardiac meetings and conferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight centers in 4 countries (Cameroon, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa) will recruit&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment is expected to be complete in 12 to 24 months. Follow-up will continue for a&#xD;
      minimum of 6 months after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Completion of standardized questionnaire to collect epidemiological and clinical data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Echocardiographic assessment, including standardized assessment of right ventricular&#xD;
           function&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collection of peripheral blood for assessment of routine blood investigations and serum&#xD;
           biomarkers (in selected centers only, shipment to the Hatter Institute if funding can be&#xD;
           secured)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data entry in web-based data system and upload of files as ECG, echocardiography, chest&#xD;
           X-ray images. Source documents will be stored at the trial sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KEY ROLES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Coordinators: Leaders of the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute Sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
      (PVRI SSA) Task Force [Ana Mocumbi (Mozambique) and Karen Sliwa (Cape Town)] will serve as&#xD;
      project coordinators. The Hatter Cardiovascular Research Institute will function as the&#xD;
      coordinating centre and will store the serum samples in minus 80 degree freezers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Investigators: One person from each participating country will be designated to&#xD;
      serve as Principal Investigator for that country.&#xD;
