      The main purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of sleep disruption (two days in&#xD;
      a row where sleep is shortened and disrupted) on inflammation, mood (how you feel), and pain&#xD;
      processing (your own experiences/perceptions of pain). In this research project, we are&#xD;
      trying to figure out if we can change the effects of sleep disruption on inflammation, mood,&#xD;
      and pain. Therefore, we will study whether taking a low-dose aspirin pill every day over 2&#xD;
      weeks can change how we respond to sleep disruption. For example, does the sensitivity to&#xD;
      pain (e.g., how intense the feeling of pain is if we put our hand in very hot or very cold&#xD;
      water) change with sleep disruption, and can low-dose aspirin influence this change. We are&#xD;
      also interested in seeing how inflammation changes in relation to your own perceived&#xD;
      experience of pain.&#xD;

      Sleep that is deficient in quantity or quality leads to upregulation of inflammatory markers&#xD;
      (Mullington et al., 2010). In particular, interleukin (IL)-6 and prostaglandin (PG) E2 are&#xD;
      elevated in experimental models of sleep restriction or total sleep deprivation, as well as&#xD;
      in insomnia. Inflammation is thought to be a key mechanism through which insufficient sleep&#xD;
      increases the risk of developing or exacerbating various disorders, including cardiovascular&#xD;
      and metabolic disorders (Mullington et al., 2009), as well as pain-related disorders (Haack&#xD;
      et al., 2009c). With respect to pain, markers such as IL-6 and PGE2 are able to sensitize&#xD;
      pain transmission neurons, thereby increasing their responsiveness to stimulation. In the&#xD;
      context of insufficient sleep, both IL-6 and PGE2 have been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      increased spontaneous pain (Haack et al., 2007;Haack et al., 2009a), suggesting their&#xD;
      mediating role in pain amplification as a consequence of insufficient sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings raise the question of whether pain amplification can be dampened by preventing&#xD;
      the inflammatory increase in response to insufficient sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this pilot project is to gather preliminary support for the hypothesis&#xD;
      that deficient sleep leads to pain amplification through an inflammatory mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the primary goal of this proposal, the secondary goal is to gather preliminary&#xD;
      data on the effects of aspirin on blood pressure regulation. Cardiovascular disease is the&#xD;
      leading cause of death in the United States. A modest reduction of blood pressure (BP; i.e.,&#xD;
      3 to 5 mmHg) in the population will produce a significant fall in serious cardiovascular&#xD;
      events (Turnbull, 2003). It has been reported that low-dose aspirin may significantly reduce&#xD;
      BP (i.e., 6 to 7 mmHg) when taken at bedtime (Hermida et al., 1994;Hermida et al.,&#xD;
      1997;Hermida et al., 2003b;Hermida et al., 2003a;Hermida et al., 2005a;Hermida et al.,&#xD;
      2005b). Aspirin, when taken at bedtime, may modulate 24h blood pressure by decreasing the&#xD;
      nocturnal rise of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity (Snoep et al., 2009)&#xD;
      and attenuating the nocturnal drop in nitric oxide (NO) production (Hermida et al., 2005b).&#xD;
      However, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Therefore, the second goal of this&#xD;
      pilot project is to investigate the potential mechanisms contributing to BP reduction in&#xD;
      response to aspirin taken at bedtime.&#xD;
