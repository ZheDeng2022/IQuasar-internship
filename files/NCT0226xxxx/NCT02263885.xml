  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will evaluate the safety, and initial efficacy of using the ExAblate&#xD;
      Transcranial to create a unilateral lesion in the globus pallidus as an adjunct to PD&#xD;
      medications in subjects who are over 30 years of age and considered medication-refractory&#xD;
      with advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and initial clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      ExAblate Transcranial unilateral thermal ablation of the globus pallidus of subjects&#xD;
      suffering from medication-refractory, advanced idiopathic PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected to establish the basic safety and clinical efficacy of this type of&#xD;
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate the full clinical efficacy.&#xD;

    <description>Safety will be determined by an evaluation of the incidence and severity of device- and procedure-related complications from the first treatment day visit through the 6 month post-treatment time point. All AEs will be reported and categorized by investigators as definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, or unrelated to the device, pallidotomy procedure, and/or Parkinson's disease progression. Alternative treatments for PD subject tremor will also be captured should they occur. Adverse events will be reviewed by a Data Safety Monitoring Board at periodic intervals. Relative safety of the ExAblate Transcranial treatment will be evaluated as compared to other methodologies for creating pallidotomy as reported in the literature.</description>
