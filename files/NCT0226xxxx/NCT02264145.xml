  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to determine the effect of the ethanolic solutions inhaled from the&#xD;
      Metered dose inhaler (MDI) (15.5 mg, 31.2 mg and 62.4 mg of ethanol) and from Respimat® (18.4&#xD;
      of ethanol) on the breath alcohol measurements in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim is to determine the linear dose-effect for the HFA 134a-MDI doses. An open,&#xD;
      randomized, four-way-cross-over design is chosen. The randomization is balanced and&#xD;
      stratified in accordance with predicted values of the volunteers of Total Lung Capacity (TLC)&#xD;

             which may influence the results of the study or the subjects ability to participate in&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
