  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is to investigate the response of vascular active factors, vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VEGF) and angiotensin-Ⅱ (AT-Ⅱ) to ovary stimulation during 24h in patients&#xD;
      with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Controled prospective clinical study involved 60 women&#xD;
      undergoing in vitro fertilization. Fifty-two patients with PCOS and 8 control cases were&#xD;
      stimulated with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) during the early follicular phase of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle (4st to 7th days of the cycle).The blood was sampled before the injection (0&#xD;
      hour) and at the 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours points after the stimulation. VEGF, AT-Ⅱ were&#xD;
      measured by radioimmunoassay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After ovary stimulation, the level of VEGF in typical PCOS patients is obviously increased at&#xD;
      the 3hs time point (p&lt;0.05), while there is no difference with VEGF at all other time point&#xD;
      among the four groups. As for AT-Ⅱ, before and after the ovary stimulation, at all time&#xD;
      points, the AT-Ⅱ levels in serum of patients with different phenotypes of PCOS by Rotterdam&#xD;
      criteria are all higher than the controls without PCOS. After the ovary stimulation, AT-Ⅱ in&#xD;
      typical PCOS patients is obviously increased at 3hs time point, p&lt;0.05. The response of VEGF&#xD;
      and AT-Ⅱ to HCG in women with typical PCOS is higher in 24 hours after the stimulation during&#xD;
      the early follicular phase. The response to the stimulation is different in patients with&#xD;
      different phenotypes of PCOS by Rotterdam criteria. Serum VEGF and AT-Ⅱ levels as a possible&#xD;
      contributor to a great risk of developing OHSS in patients with typical PCOS during the early&#xD;
      follicular phase in 24 hours after the ovary stimulation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A total of 60 women were recruited and divided into four groups by Rotterdam criteria&#xD;
             according to three typical characters:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. biochemical characteristics of hyperandrogenism (HA)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. chronic anovulation&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. polycystic ovary morphology (PCO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All women were matched for age (&lt;35 yr).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects were screened, and no other endocrine disturbances (thyroid, adrenal) or&#xD;
             medical illnesses were found.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All the patients did not have any hormonal preparation during the 3 months preceding&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
