  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Longterm disease-free survival (DFS) of older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      remains poor. The vast majority of AML patients relapses within two years after start of&#xD;
      therapy1,2. In Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL, AML M3), all-trans-retinoic-acid (ATRA;&#xD;
      Tretinoin) induces differentiation and subsequently clinical remission. So far effective&#xD;
      differentiation therapy does not exist in other AML subtypes. Recent preclinical data suggest&#xD;
      that the combinatorial use of ATRA and tranylcypromine (TCP), an irreversible&#xD;
      Monoamine-Oxidase (MAO) and Lysin-specific demethylase (LSD) inhibitor that also inhibits&#xD;
      LSD1 (a histone H3 Lysine 4 demethylase), induces leukemia cell differentiation and leukemic&#xD;
      stem cell exhaustion in vitro and in vivo in non-APL AML subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Phase I/II study the investigators will explore the feasibility, safety, as well as&#xD;
      efficacy and of Tretinoin/TCP treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or in&#xD;
      patients with AML who are not eligible for intensive treatment. Patients will be treated with&#xD;
      daily increasing doses of TCP (initially 10 mg/day, then +10 mg each day up to 80mg/d). After&#xD;
      7 days, ATRA will be added at a fixed dose (45 mg/sqm/day). Overall, 16 evaluable patients&#xD;
      are going to be treated. The primary endpoint is the fraction of patients that achieve CR,&#xD;
      CRp( complete response with incomplete recovery of platelets), CRi (complete response with&#xD;
      incomplete recovery of granulocytes) and PR. Secondary endpoints are tolerability, safety as&#xD;
      well as progression-free survival and overall survival. Serum levels of TCP will be regularly&#xD;
      analyzed. Pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed with analyses of the inhibition of LSD1&#xD;
      by TCP. Further analyses will address the changes in Histone H3 lysine 4 tri demethylase&#xD;
      (H3K4me3) levels in AML blasts and the differentiation status of AML blasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, this Phase I/II study will analyze feasibility, pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      effectivity of ATRA and TCP as differentiation therapy in AML.&#xD;
