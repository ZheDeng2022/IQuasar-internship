      The objectives of this survey are to determine the level of antimicrobial resistance&#xD;
      knowledge and perception of health care workers (HCW) in France, to measure the impact of&#xD;
      health care facilities (HCF) and to identify the drivers and barriers to change. To achieve&#xD;
      this goal, a cross-sectional survey on one day with a self-administered questionnaire and&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with HCWs is proposed. This study will be planned in 60 different&#xD;
      HCFs randomly selected and expected to include of 2,100 to 10,000 respondents.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND The landscape of antibiotic resistance in hospital has dramatically evolved over&#xD;
      the past 10 years, with rapid change of multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs), i.e.&#xD;
      decreasing rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and increasing&#xD;
      prevalence of Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) - producing Enterobacteriaceae in the&#xD;
      community and the hospital, emergence of highly resistant bacteria (HRB) especially&#xD;
      vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)&#xD;
      that are most often imported for foreign countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schematically, the control of bacterial resistance is based on the modulation of antibiotics&#xD;
      prescription and on the interruption of HRB or MDRO cross-transmission. Many recommendations&#xD;
      have recently been issued for the management of patients carrying HRB or MDRO, but their&#xD;
      level of knowledge and implementation in health care facilities (HCF) remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge and perception of resistance to antimicrobials in among health care workers (HCW)&#xD;
      are influenced by individual and societal determinants, professional environment and personal&#xD;
      experience. The willing of improving antimicrobial resistance awareness and changing&#xD;
      behaviors requires an accurate overview of the knowledge and perceptions of the HCW within&#xD;
      the French health care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The main objective is to determine the level of antimicrobial resistance knowledge&#xD;
      among HCWs in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are: 1) to determine the antimicrobial resistance perception of HCW&#xD;
      in France; 2) to measure the impact of HCF organisation and the perception on the knowledge&#xD;
      of HCW; 3) to identify and analyse the drivers and barriers to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS The methodology used is a cross-sectional survey on one day with a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire and semi-structured interviews with HCW (doctors, nurses and&#xD;
      aides, employed or in training, and directly participating in care). This survey will be&#xD;
      implemented in a random sample representative of the French HCFs. The questionnaires include&#xD;
      data on HCF and individual data on respondents and evaluations regarding: the knowledge of&#xD;
      HCW (landscape of resistance, the role and control of cross-transmission, the role of&#xD;
      selective pressure caused by antibiotics), the perception of antimicrobial resistance (using&#xD;
      the Health Belief Model), a measure of organization's workplace culture (based on leadership,&#xD;
      commitment, team communication and level of stress / chaos). Semi-structured interviews have&#xD;
      been planned to complement the assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUDGING CRITERIA The main criterion is the level of knowledge with binary encoding. The&#xD;
      secondary criteria are based on the psycho-social-cognitive determinants of knowledge and&#xD;
      perceptions and the culture of the organisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSIONS Six types of HCF (university hospital, large or small public hospitals, private&#xD;
      HCFs, referral centers for cancer, and a mixed group of local hospitals, long term care and&#xD;
      post-op and rehabilitation facilities, and nursing homes in each of the 5 interregional&#xD;
      coordination centers for infection control (CCLIN). All eligible HCWs working during the&#xD;
      survey day will be included. A minimum of 2,100 HCW is required to properly estimate the rate&#xD;
      of HCW with the minimum core of knowledge (p&lt;0.05). Actually, a larger number of 5,000 to&#xD;
      10,000 participants should be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All HCWs, employed or training, working during the day of the survey (day and night) in the&#xD;
      selected HCF will be included except the health workers who are not involved in direct care,&#xD;
      non-medical staff other than nurses or nursing auxiliary.&#xD;
