  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose escalation trial to assess MTD of MK-3475 in combination with mFOLFOX6&#xD;
      followed by a safety expansion open label, nonrandomized trial with MK-3475 at MTD in&#xD;
      combination with mFOLFOX6 and supplemental celecoxib in 4 cohorts of advanced/metastatic GI&#xD;
      malignancies (pancreatic, gastro esophageal, colorectal/appendiceal adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
      biliary carcinoma) to assess response rate, clinical benefit rate, progression free survival&#xD;
      and overall survival. The safety expansion cohort will assess the effect of the addition of&#xD;
      celecoxib to patients that do not respond to combination MK-3475/mFOLFOX treatment.&#xD;
