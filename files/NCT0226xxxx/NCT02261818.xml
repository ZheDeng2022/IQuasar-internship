      Can peer mentors be integrated into depression care to older adults with mental health&#xD;
      professional supervision? We will assess whether peer mentors who are lay persons who are in&#xD;
      recovery from depression can provide depression care services to older adults with&#xD;
      depression. Older adults who are 50 and older will be screened for depression in the clinic&#xD;
      and community. Those who meet criteria will be paired with a peer mentor for 8 meetings. Peer&#xD;
      mentors will audiorecord their meetings with the patient and the recordings will be analyzed&#xD;
      to assess what kinds of communication and behaviors the peer mentors engage in and what among&#xD;
      those communications may be associated with relieving depression. The peer mentor will be&#xD;
      trained and supervised by a psychiatrist and they will form a team to provide the depression&#xD;
      care to the older adult. The study aims to relieve depressive symptoms and engage older&#xD;
      adults in care. Both older adults and peer mentors wil be interviewed after the study to&#xD;
      assess the strengths and weaknesses of peer mentor delivery of depression care. A manual will&#xD;
      be developed describing the process and procedures of the study.&#xD;

      Recruitment of peer mentors. We will recruit peer mentors from a community organization who&#xD;
      are in recovery and are recommended by the organization and have had basic training in&#xD;
      supportive listening and experience working with persons in the community in need of mental&#xD;
      health support. We will recruit 10 peer mentors, striving for a balance of men and women, and&#xD;
      accounting for attrition, so that at least 5 peer mentors will participate in the project.&#xD;
      The study doctor will meet and interview interested peers to screen for eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      motivation and aptitude. Persons who do not meet criteria for continued participation in the&#xD;
      study will be referred to other volunteer opportunities when appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of patients. Twenty patient participants will be recruited through the internal&#xD;
      medicine and psychiatry clinics at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center as well as the&#xD;
      community. A research assistant will screen patients for depressive symptoms with the Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Patients meeting eligibility criteria will give written&#xD;
      informed consent. Eligible patients will be scheduled for another appointment to meet with&#xD;
      the study doctor in a private room at offices in the clinical campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training of peer mentors. The PI and research assistant will conduct 5 sessions totaling 20&#xD;
      hours of training for the peer mentors. Training will refine the peer mentor's social support&#xD;
      behaviors, which include the use of effective communication skills, rapport building, active&#xD;
      listening, and sharing of experiential knowledge, and expression of empathy. Issues of&#xD;
      cultural interviewing, cultural competence, patient confidentiality, DSM-IV diagnosis,&#xD;
      differentiation of peer and professional roles and patient safety will be addressed.&#xD;
      Knowledge regarding how mental health and illness presents itself in old age and the specific&#xD;
      developmental problems older adults face will be provided. Training will include review of&#xD;
      written materials, lectures, discussion of case studies and role play. Upon completion of the&#xD;
      training, peer mentors will be assessed for mental health knowledge and interpersonal skills&#xD;
      and those who pass muster will be matched with patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peer mentor role: Activities of the peer mentor with the patient will be structured by&#xD;
      the following principles which are derived from important elements of both peer support and&#xD;
      psychotherapy and our preliminary work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principles to structure peer mentor interactions with patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish a working relationship&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish goals of meetings with patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Provide active listening, empathy, reciprocity, mutual respect, provision of emotional&#xD;
           support Provide support and encourage work toward patient-identified goals to relieve&#xD;
           depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Work on patient-identified goals by engaging multiple techniques as appropriate: sharing&#xD;
           appropriate coping strategies eg. positive thinking, experiential knowledge, problem&#xD;
           solving, consideration of different perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Provide psychoeducation. Discuss the kinds of depression services available,&#xD;
           medications, psychotherapy Acknowledge socioeconomic contributors to depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Provide information on community resources&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Connect to professional clinical services if appropriate The psychiatrist role: Peer&#xD;
           mentors will meet with the candidate who is a psychiatrist on a weekly basis. The&#xD;
           psychiatrist will provide: (1) clinical leadership and structure by reinforcing the&#xD;
           principles of the peer-patient meetings; and (2) supervision and coaching which will&#xD;
           involve encouragement, continuing education, training and skill enhancement for the peer&#xD;
           mentor. The psychiatrist will guide the peer mentor to ensure that a positive social&#xD;
           experience is being provided and to manage the patient in a way that ensures the&#xD;
           realization of the patient's goal. The peer mentor will share impressions of patient&#xD;
           progress and receive any guidance needed from the psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures. After patient consent is obtained, the psychiatrist will meet with the&#xD;
      patient for a clinical interview so that the psychiatrist can form an impression of the&#xD;
      patient and provide relevant guidance to the peer mentor. The patient will then be matched&#xD;
      with a peer mentor. The peer mentor will contact the patient by telephone to schedule a&#xD;
      meeting and meet with the peer mentor at his home or in the clinic. The peer mentor will meet&#xD;
      the patient weekly for 8 one-hour sessions. The peer mentors will meet individually on a&#xD;
      weekly basis with the psychiatrist during the study period in a collaborative and supervisory&#xD;
      effort regarding the care of the patient Data Analysis. Analysis will involve both&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative methods. We will identify measured factors related to engagement&#xD;
      and depression response and remission so that we can understand how the delivery model may&#xD;
      need to be tailored or modified. This analysis will consider depression response and&#xD;
      remission and engagement as dependent variables, with other variables as predictors or effect&#xD;
      modifiers. We will also carry out debriefing interviews with peers and patients in order to&#xD;
      look for themes that will call attention to factors that are most salient to patients and&#xD;
      peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative analysis. Influential variables will be identified in the statistical models&#xD;
      according to association with the dependent variables, namely 1) engagement in depression&#xD;
      care defined as two or more sessions attended with the peer mentor, and 2) decrease in&#xD;
      depressive symptoms which will be treated as a continuous variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis. We will collect qualitative data to obtain the perspective of peer&#xD;
      mentors and patients themselves regarding study processes and mediators from their point of&#xD;
      view. Two semi-structured interviews with patients and peer mentors will be conducted by the&#xD;
      PI at 4 weeks and upon completion of the study. The purpose will be to obtain feedback&#xD;
      regarding positive and negative aspects of the peer delivery model which will provide&#xD;
      perspectives different from the expert and valuable for that reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS OF PROCESS We will analyze the process of the peer mentor-patient interactions by 1)&#xD;
      conducting an interaction analysis which will provide quantitative associations between&#xD;
      communication elements and outcomes to determine which elements are salient to the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the peer delivery model, and 2) conducting a qualitative analysis of the&#xD;
      voice recordings to assess how the peer mentors implement the critical elements and how&#xD;
      patients respond to them. The analyses of process will serve to determine the content of the&#xD;
      training for peer mentors, the activities peers will perform with patients and manual&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) is a widely used system for interaction&#xD;
      assessment in medical contexts. The RIAS has demonstrated predictive validity to patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, patient recall, and improvements in levels of emotional distress. Combined with&#xD;
      quantitative process and outcome measures of care, statistical analysis can establish&#xD;
      associations between specific communicative thematic categories and patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis. We will evaluate the specific interactions between peer and patient employing&#xD;
      the RIAS to investigate the specific interactions that are associated with engagement and&#xD;
      depression response and remission so that we can refine the training required for peers and&#xD;
      develop measures tapping effective interaction strategies. We will also carry out open-ended&#xD;
      interviews with patients that complement the RIAS analysis to assess how the peer mentors&#xD;
      implement the critical elements and how patients respond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative analysis. The voice recordings to be analyzed with the RIAS in Phase 2 are&#xD;
      obtained from two sources: (1) 28 voice recordings of peer mentor-patient interactions were&#xD;
      obtained in our preliminary work and (2) 160 voice recordings of peer mentor-patient&#xD;
      interactions will be obtained in the pilot study proposed in this application. The PI will&#xD;
      work with Dr. Roter's laboratory for consultation where coding, reliability testing, and data&#xD;
      entry into an SPSS file will occur. We will draw upon our conceptual model as well as&#xD;
      incorporate the results of the quantitative and qualitative analysis regarding mediators to&#xD;
      construct peer mentor and patient communication profiles which will then be linked to&#xD;
      outcomes. Those elements which are associated with outcomes should be the focus of peer&#xD;
      mentor training and be integrated into the manual. We will use linear regression to assess&#xD;
      the presence, strength, and statistical associations between RIAS categories and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis. The goal of qualitative analysis of the voice recordings will be to&#xD;
      enrich the inferences we make using RIAS data to capture the nuances of what is occurring in&#xD;
      the peer mentor-patient relationship. The PI and the research assistant will listen to the&#xD;
      voice recordings of peer mentor-patient interactions at weeks 1, 4, and 8. They will mark and&#xD;
      transcribe sections in the voice recordings that show how interaction elements such as&#xD;
      affective exchange take place between the peer mentor and patient, and those sections that&#xD;
      provide examples of variations in the methods the peer mentors use and the responses of the&#xD;
      patients. The transcriptions will be coded and analyzed for themes. This analysis will&#xD;
      contextualize the results of the RIAS analysis and provide knowledge about peer mentor&#xD;
      communication and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual development: Knowledge obtained from the study will be developed into a manual which&#xD;
      will form the basis for a larger peer mentor study.&#xD;
