      In this project the investigators will train home care nurses to use the Carer Support Needs&#xD;
      Assessment Tool (CSNAT) with a group of family caregivers (intervention group) and then&#xD;
      compare the family caregivers' quality of life, burden and other outcomes to a group of&#xD;
      family caregivers whose home care nurse is not using the CSNAT (control group). Findings will&#xD;
      allow us to determine the effectiveness of using the CSNAT as a tool to identify, monitor and&#xD;
      address family caregiver support needs in palliative home care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caregiving places considerable burdens on family caregivers (FCG). While burden has been&#xD;
      studied as a FCG outcome, it is also a predictor of other outcomes, including FCG quality of&#xD;
      life (QoL). We have adapted a model of caregiver burden to hypothesize the various mechanisms&#xD;
      by which addressing support needs may contribute to FCG QoL. In this model, support needs are&#xD;
      closely associated with FCGs' perceived social support and preparedness for caregiving. These&#xD;
      variables operate as (partial) mediators of the relationships between primary stressors,&#xD;
      including patient functional dependence and symptom distress, and secondary appraisals, such&#xD;
      as the perceived burden associated with caregiving, which, in turn influences FCGs QoL. The&#xD;
      model further posits that FCGs' primary appraisal of patient caregiving needs (e.g., amount&#xD;
      of care provided) is influenced by the functional dependence and symptom distress of the&#xD;
      patient, and in turn influences perceived support, preparedness for caregiving, FCG burden,&#xD;
      and, ultimately, FCG QoL. These variables are associated with a variety of demographic and&#xD;
      health-related characteristics of the caregiver and patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the context of this conceptual framework outlined above, the CSNAT intervention is&#xD;
      viewed as a mediator of the relationships between primary stressors and appraisals and FCG&#xD;
      QoL (primary outcome). Also, the CSNAT intervention would lead to enhanced social support,&#xD;
      preparedness, and reduced caregiver burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clustered randomized control trial (RCT) design will be used to ascertain the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the CSNAT as an intervention to improve the QoL of FCGs of patients receiving palliative&#xD;
      care at home. Participating home care nurses will be randomized to one of two comparator&#xD;
      groups (usual care and intervention) and the FCGs of their patients will be assigned to the&#xD;
      corresponding comparator group. Data will additionally be collected over the same time frame&#xD;
      and in the same manner from a non-randomized comparison usual care comparator group from a&#xD;
      separate home care site where no nurses will be delivering the intervention, to help&#xD;
      interpret the results (e.g., to determine the extent to which contamination may be have&#xD;
      occurred). Update - August 31, 2015 - Due to low recruitment the non-randomized, comparison,&#xD;
      usual care, comparator group has been discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update - December 22, 2016 - Due to home care workloads of participant nurses and home care&#xD;
      visit schedules in some participating home care offices, delivery of the intervention will be&#xD;
      done by a dedicated study nurse (in some offices only). In these offices, family caregivers&#xD;
      will continue to be assigned based on the randomized group assignment of their home care&#xD;
      nurse. The dedicated study nurse will meet separately with FCGs who are in the intervention&#xD;
      group to deliver the CSNAT intervention. Information arising from the CSNAT about family&#xD;
      caregivers' support needs will be communicated by the study nurse to the home care nurse so&#xD;
      that the home care nurse can incorporate this into the home care plan for the patient and&#xD;
      patient's family. In home care offices that are not part of this change in procedures, the&#xD;
      home care nurses in the intervention group will continue to deliver the CSNAT intervention&#xD;
      during home care visits as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: The use of the CSNAT as a practice support tool intervention will lead to&#xD;
           improved FCG QoL during the time prior to the patients' death and in bereavement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: The use of the CSNAT as a practice support tool intervention will&#xD;
           contribute to the following secondary outcomes in FCGs during the time prior to the&#xD;
           patient's death: enhanced perceived social support, improved preparedness to provide&#xD;
           care and reduced caregiving burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3: CSNAT use during home care of patient before death will reduce grief&#xD;
           symptoms during bereavement, among FCGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the RCT, qualitative and quantitative research will be conducted to understand&#xD;
      the process related to implementing the CSNAT intervention in palliative home care and to&#xD;
      explain the treatment results. We will specifically address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How are the CSNAT support needs being documented and met by home care nurses?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do home care nurses experience the use of the CSNAT in their daily practice?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How comfortable are FCGs speaking to home care nurses about their own personal needs?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To what extent are the relationships in the hypothesized conceptual framework supported?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the relative importance of different CSNAT support needs with respect to FCG QoL&#xD;
           and health during the illness trajectory, and the presence of post-bereavement grief&#xD;
           symptoms?&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 week intervals up to 96 weeks or patient death (whichever comes first)</time_frame>
    <description>The QOLLTI-F is a self-report measure of family caregiver quality of life. It is composed of 16 items which assess the following 7 domains: state of carer, patient well-being, quality of care, outlook, environment, finances and relationships. Additional exploratory analyses will also be conducted on these subscales.</description>

    <description>The TRIG is a 21 item scale designed to assess grief symptoms. It relates to two points of time: past (immediate of shortly after the death) and present (the time of data collection). The 2 subscales measure a) feelings and actions at the time of the death and b) present feelings.</description>
