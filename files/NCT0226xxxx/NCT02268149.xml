        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent signed and dated prior to participation into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants in the study should be healthy males, aged 18-50 years old inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants should be within (+- 20%) of their ideal body weight (Broca-Index)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-smokers (subject who have never smoked) or ex-smoker for at least one year with a&#xD;
             smoking history, no greater than five pack-years (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes per day&#xD;
             for 1 year)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to comply with the concomitant therapy restrictions as detailed in Clinical&#xD;
             Trial Protocol (CTP)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be off all prescription drugs. O.T.C. drugs must be discontinued for at&#xD;
             least two weeks prior to participation in the study. If throughout the study, subjects&#xD;
             need any O.T.C. medication, the investigator will call the clinical monitor and this&#xD;
             will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Restrictions for different medications are&#xD;
             described in CTP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will have no evidence of clinically relevant concomitant disease based upon&#xD;
             complete medical history, full physical examination, chest-x-ray (if not done in&#xD;
             previous 6 months), ECG and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Viral respiratory tract infection or a respiratory tract infection within the six&#xD;
             weeks preceding dosing with study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Small or difficult to locate arm or hand veins that would impair the clinicians&#xD;
             ability to draw blood samples or to place a venous catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a known drug or alcohol dependence (absence of dependency for 10 years)&#xD;
             or who drink more than 60 g of alcohol per day, history of significant allergic&#xD;
             reactions to drugs or sensitivity to aspirin or positive drug screen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of investigational new drug in the preceding month or six half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             greater) prior to the first screen at Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donation of blood during the month preceding Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving hyposensitization therapy who are not on a stable dose for the last&#xD;
             three months before Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or with&#xD;
             psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known history of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with chronic or relevant acute infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with history of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is&#xD;
             deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with eosinophilia &gt; 7 %&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who received any other drugs, which might influence the results of the trial&#xD;
             during the weeks prior to dosing with study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who participated in excessive physical activities (e.g. competitive sports)&#xD;
             within the last week before dosing with study medication&#xD;
