        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants in the study should be healthy males, range from 50 to 65 years of age and&#xD;
        be within +- 20% of their normal weight (Broca-Index).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers will be excluded from the study if the result of the medical examination or&#xD;
             laboratory tests (especially those which indicate liver malfunction) are judged by the&#xD;
             clinical investigator to differ significantly from the normal clinical values&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with blood pressure lower than 120/80 mm Hg or pulse rate below 60&#xD;
             beats/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers whose blood pressure dropped below 100/60 mm Hg in the pre-test within 80&#xD;
             mg propranolol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with Raw-values higher than their predicted normal upper limit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with known gastrointestinal, hepatic , renal, respiratory, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders&#xD;
&#xD;

             psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with known history of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with chronic or relevant acute infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with history of allergy / hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which&#xD;
             is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who have taken a drug with a long half life (&gt;=24 hours) within at least&#xD;
             one month or less than ten half lives of the respective drug before enrolment in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who received any other drugs which might influence the results of the trial&#xD;
             during the week prior the start of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who have participated in another study with an investigational drug within&#xD;
             the last 2 month preceding this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who are unable to refrain from smoking on the study days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who smoke more than 10 cigarettes (or 3 cigars or pipes) per day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who drink more than 40 g of alcohol per day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who are dependent on drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who have donated blood (&gt;=100ml) within the last 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who participated in excessive physical activities (e.g. competitive sports)&#xD;
             within the last week before the study&#xD;
