      This project intends to use preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) with the microarray&#xD;
      technique to determine the chromosome composition of fertilized eggs, so that only&#xD;
      chromosomally normal embryos are transferred during IVF. The purpose is to increase the&#xD;
      probability of pregnancy and childbirth among couples with a history of repeated unsuccessful&#xD;
      IVF attempts.&#xD;

      Background In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most important method to remedy infertility,&#xD;
      whether the cause is the male or the female, or when the cause is unknown. Treatment usually&#xD;
      involves the transfer to the uterus of a fertilized egg (embryo) that has been cultured for&#xD;
      2-5 days. To select the embryo with the best chance of successful implantation into the&#xD;
      endometrium, microscopic evaluation is currently used to grade embryonic cell division,&#xD;
      cellular appearance, and other factors. But this method is incomplete because it cannot&#xD;
      determine the functional properties of the embryo, or whether it is genetically normal. It is&#xD;
      known that couples with a history of multiple unsuccessful IVF treatments produce a large&#xD;
      number of embryos that have an abnormal number of chromosomes (aneuploidy), which is also&#xD;
      common in women over age 38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project intends to use preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) with the microarray&#xD;
      technique to determine the chromosome composition of fertilized eggs, so that only&#xD;
      chromosomally normal embryos are transferred during IVF. The purpose is to increase the&#xD;
      probability of pregnancy and childbirth among couples with a history of repeated unsuccessful&#xD;
      IVF attempts. We have previously conducted a prospective randomized study with a similar&#xD;
      question (Ã– 612-02) on a target group of older women (&gt;38 years) using sampling (biopsy) of&#xD;
      the embryo on day 3 of culture, followed by analysis of seven chromosome pairs using the FISH&#xD;
      technique. The results of the study showed no improvement in pregnancy outcome . The reasons&#xD;
      are probably 1) to begin with, normal eggs are infrequent in this target group; 2) the biopsy&#xD;
      was performed on day 3 when the embryo is at a sensitive stage; and 3) only 7 out of a total&#xD;
      of 23 chromosome pairs could be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological developments in the field have been rapid, and current technology allows for&#xD;
      better identification of normal embryos compared with the previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We know that the embryo is less sensitive when a biopsy is carried out on day 5 (of the&#xD;
           blastocyst stage) instead of day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In blastocyst biopsy, more cells are removed for diagnosis than on a day 3 biopsy&#xD;
           (thereby increasing the reliability of the analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blastocyst biopsy involves removal of fewer cells on a percentage basis (3-5%) from the&#xD;
           total cell mass of the blastocyst compared with the previously used day 3 biopsy, which&#xD;
           involved removal of up to 25% of the total number of cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blastocysts have a higher implantation rate than day 3 embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) can now be used with great precision to&#xD;
           analyze all chromosomes using commercial quality-controlled kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cryopreservation with vitrification of blastocysts is currently a highly successful&#xD;
           technique that allows the analysis to be conducted without being pressed for time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will turn to a patient group consisting of women with a proven normal-good&#xD;
      ovarian reserve. In the previous study involving women &gt;38 years, the ovarian reserve was&#xD;
      generally poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparatory work for the Genetic Integrity Act stated that PGS should &quot;be reserved for&#xD;
      clearly defined research projects approved in an ethical review by an ethics committee.&quot; This&#xD;
      restriction was imposed because the state of knowledge about PGS at that time was very&#xD;
      limited. More experience from research projects on PGS was considered necessary to determine&#xD;
      whether PGS could be used in clinical practice. The above mentioned preparatory work for the&#xD;
      Genetic Integrity Act also states that PGS &quot;may become an important tool to increase chances&#xD;
      of pregnancy in conjunction with IVF treatment ...&quot;. In this project, we intend to&#xD;
      investigate whether it is possible to increase the chance of pregnancy and childbirth among&#xD;
      couples who have undergone several previous failed IVF attempts. Our hypothesis is based on&#xD;
      the assumption that an incorrect number of chromosomes is often the underlying cause of&#xD;
      failed implantation or miscarriage. To increase the chances of establishing a pregnancy that&#xD;
      leads to childbirth, we are conducting a chromosome analysis on the embryos of couples to&#xD;
      ensure that only embryos with a normal chromosome set are transferred to the woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question Can the probability of pregnancy and childbirth in couples with several previous&#xD;
      failed IVF attempts increase if a normal chromosome set can be ensured in the embryo before&#xD;
      it is transferred? As a control, we will compare the results of IVF attempts where only light&#xD;
      microscopic evaluation is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Delivery per randomized patient Secondary endpoints: Cumulative pregnancy&#xD;
      rate including later transfer of remaining vitrified blastocysts (higher rate expected in&#xD;
      study group). Miscarriage rate during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy (lower rate expected in&#xD;
      study group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and materials Patients Couples with a history of at least three unsuccessful IVF&#xD;
      attempts, in which the woman is a maximum of 39 years of age, will be invited in conjunction&#xD;
      with their consultation for a new IVF treatment at any of IVF Sweden clinics to participate&#xD;
      in the study, provided that they meet the inclusion criteria (including expected normal&#xD;
      response to hormone stimulation with 8-10 eggs). The women who agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be randomized (by computer) to either the biopsy or the control group the day&#xD;
      after collection of oocytes if they have at least 5 fertilized eggs (current procedure for&#xD;
      culture on day 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Couples who meet the criteria for IVF treatment and who have a history of&#xD;
      at least three previous IVF cycles including embryo transfer without delivery. The woman may&#xD;
      be a maximum of 39 years old when the study is carried out and must have a normal-good&#xD;
      ovarian reserve ( at least 12 antral follicles). Her partner must be able to provide a semen&#xD;
      sample containing live sperm. Women included in the study will not participate in any other&#xD;
      research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Myoma, or other uterine lesions judged to affect implantation.&#xD;
      Nonspecific cysts that are not considered to be functional. Endometrium &gt;3 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will take place on day 1 if the couple meets the requirements established for&#xD;
      culture to the blastocyst stage (at least 5 normally fertilized oocytes). The on-line&#xD;
      randomization program (computerized) will balance the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of oocytes retrieved&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore at the time of randomization, the randomization program will take into account&#xD;
      that a multicenter study is involved to avoid bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVF treatment Hormone stimulation, ultrasound checks, collection of oocytes, and&#xD;
      fertilization will follow standard procedure. For women in the control group, all expanded&#xD;
      blastocysts will be cryopreserved (vitrified) day 5-6 for later transfer. For women&#xD;
      randomized to PGS, cells (trophectoderm cells in the outer cell layer of the embryo) will be&#xD;
      biopsied on day 5-6 after which all biopsied blastocysts will be vitrified. If the analysis&#xD;
      shows a normal chromosome set, the blastocyst will be thawed and transferred during the next&#xD;
      menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy and cell lysis The biopsy is carried out by making a hole in the shell of the&#xD;
      blastocyst (zona pellucida) using laser technology and special biopsy equipment and removing&#xD;
      2-5 cells from the outer cell mass (trophoblast cells). The cells are transferred to a test&#xD;
      tube containing PBS solution. An extraction solution is added to lyse the cells, and the DNA&#xD;
      is released into the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimization of genome amplification To optimize the protocol for cell lysis and whole genome&#xD;
      amplification, cells from an embryonic stem cell line with trisomy 13 as well as from a&#xD;
      normal karyotype will be used. Three, four and five cells respectively will be pipetted into&#xD;
      PCR tubes. The entire aCGH protocol (see below) will be run on these cells (at least 50&#xD;
      tubes), and the results will be evaluated. This approach will provide us with an idea of the&#xD;
      sensitivity of the method and how often we fail to obtain results due to unsuccessful&#xD;
      amplification. Contamination in the system, if any, will also be revealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) Reagent for amplification (copying) of the DNA&#xD;
      is added to the DNA extract. Amplification is carried out in several steps using a technique&#xD;
      called &quot;Polymerase Chain Reaction&quot; (PCR). This process requires great accuracy and special&#xD;
      laboratory facilities so that foreign DNA does not contaminate the sample. Contamination at&#xD;
      this step could lead to a misdiagnosis of the chromosome constitution of the embryos. The&#xD;
      amplified DNA is then labeled with a fluorescent molecule which causes the DNA to fluoresce&#xD;
      green under UV illumination. Similarly, normal control DNA is labeled with a molecule that&#xD;
      fluoresces red under UV illumination. Amplified fluorescently labeled DNA is mixed with an&#xD;
      equal volume of normal fluorescently labeled control DNA. This DNA mixture is applied to test&#xD;
      surfaces with specific DNA sequences. These DNA sequences are carefully selected and placed&#xD;
      on the test surfaces in long arrays in a specific order, which means that DNA from all&#xD;
      chromosome arms are represented on the test surface at specific locations. During the&#xD;
      hybridization step, the DNA in the DNA mixture will compete for binding to the DNA on the&#xD;
      test surface. If there are equal amounts of amplified DNA (green) and control DNA (red), then&#xD;
      an equal amount of DNA from both fractions will bind to the test surface. After&#xD;
      hybridization, when the test surface is illuminated with UV light, the green and red&#xD;
      fluorescence will be equally intense, resulting in an orange color (mixture with equal&#xD;
      portions of red and green color). However, if there is an excess of DNA from a given&#xD;
      chromosome in the embryo (e.g., trisomy), more DNA sequences from this chromosome will bind&#xD;
      to the test surface, resulting in an excess of green fluorescence in the area on the test&#xD;
      surface containing the DNA sequences from the relevant chromosome. Similarly, loss of a&#xD;
      chromosome in an embryo results in a shortage of the corresponding DNA in the amplified&#xD;
      fraction, causing more control DNA sequences (red) to bind to the test surface. Test areas&#xD;
      are scanned and results processed automatically in a computerized scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grading of embryos:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation and grading of the blastocysts will be done in accordance with accepted&#xD;
      classification according to Gardner in which degree of expansion, cell density, and number of&#xD;
      cells in the inner cell mass (IC) and in the trophectoderm (TE) are assessed. All blastocysts&#xD;
      in the control group will be vitrified for later transfer. A similar evaluation will be&#xD;
      carried out in the biopsy group prior to biopsy. Following biopsy, all biopsied blastocysts&#xD;
      will be vitrified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the group in which the biopsy is conducted, microarray analysis will be carried out.&#xD;
      Transfer is done during the natural menstrual cycle 5 days after ovulation. Women with&#xD;
      hormonal disruption require mild hormonal stimulation prior to transfer of the&#xD;
      vitrified/warmed blastocyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitrification After the blastocysts have been biopsied, they will be vitrified and&#xD;
      subsequently thawed according to well established protocol at the clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up The primary endpoint is birth per randomized patient. Secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      cumulative pregnancy rate, since extra cryopreserved blastocysts (if any) are also&#xD;
      transferred, and miscarriage rate during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy (lower rate expected&#xD;
      in study group). We plan to create a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of&#xD;
      independent external experts when half the study has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of all pregnancies and childbirths will be carried out according to current&#xD;
      procedure within IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Power analysis has shown that to detect a significant difference in pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes from the estimated 15% in the control group to 40% in the PGS group requires 112&#xD;
      patients (alpha=0.8; Beta=0.20). An estimated attrition rate of about 10% and the planned&#xD;
      DSMB analysis mean that 130 patients should be recruited. The DSMB will monitor the study and&#xD;
      provide periodic advice on whether we should continue the study. The DSMB analysis will give&#xD;
      3 recommendations: (1) continue the study as planned, (2) stop the study if the difference&#xD;
      between the groups is less than 15 %, (3) continue the study with a larger sample size. When&#xD;
      the difference between the groups are 20 % or greater the study can be continued with a&#xD;
      larger sample size (73 patients in each group The DSMB analysis will advice to continue or&#xD;
      stop the study (due to highly significant effect, negative effect or low conditional power.&#xD;
      DSMB can evaluate both live birth and ongoing pregnancy and weigh all information when they&#xD;
      give the recommendation. The DSMB will consist of specialists who are experienced in this&#xD;
      field. Statistical calculations will be carried out according to intention-to-treat (ITT), as&#xD;
      well as per protocol . ITT are all randomized patients, having at least 5 fertilized oocytes&#xD;
      on day 1. Some patients are likely to have no transfer due to the lack of blastocysts,or&#xD;
      technical problems relating to vitrification/warming etc. Therefore, analysis will also be&#xD;
      done per protocol. Logistic regression will be used in the statistical calculations and&#xD;
      include the stratification variables.&#xD;
