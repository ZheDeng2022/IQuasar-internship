    <textblock>
      Clinical social workers, doctors, outreach workers, and all other staff providing direct care&#xD;
      to vulnerable populations face multiple challenges in obtaining and maintaining training and&#xD;
      implementing evidence based practices in diverse community settings. Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing is a well-established evidence based practice that is challenging to implement&#xD;
      across programs and agencies because it requires that skills gained from training be&#xD;
      reinforced as a service provider employs the practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study builds on findings from a Phase I study. With funding from a Phase I Small&#xD;
      Business Innovation Research grant from the National Institute of Health, the Center for&#xD;
      Social Innovation developed the Motivational Interviewing Simulator: An Experiential Online&#xD;
      Training Tool. The interactive, case-based, multiplayer web-based game allows service&#xD;
      providers to deepen their skills in Motivational Interviewing (MI), a widely recognized&#xD;
      evidence-based practice that supports people to make positive behavior changes related to&#xD;
      health, wellness, mental illness, and addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II randomized controlled trial's primary aim is to assess the relative&#xD;
      effectiveness of three interventions (MI Training Only; MI Training + eBook; MI Training +&#xD;
      SIM) in increasing provider MI knowledge and skill retention over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase II of this study, we will recruit 180 providers from 18 community agencies&#xD;
      serving individuals who live in supportive housing, many of whom have histories of mental&#xD;
      illness, addiction, homelessness, and medical problems. After receiving a standardized&#xD;
      two-day onsite MI training, participants will be randomized into one of three conditions: 1)&#xD;
      MI Training Only; 2) MI Training + eBook (an online comparison with comparable information to&#xD;
      the Simulator without the interactive elements); or 3) MI Training + Simulator. The&#xD;
      longitudinal, mixed methods study will assess providers' acquisition and retention of MI&#xD;
      knowledge and skills through surveys and coding of standardized client interviews; barriers&#xD;
      and facilitators of MI implementation via focus groups; organizational-level data via key&#xD;
      informant interviews and site visits; and client outcomes for 3,600 clients through surveys,&#xD;
      administrative, data and focus groups.&#xD;

      Between 2011 and 2012, the Center for Social Innovation, LLC (C4), developed and evaluated a&#xD;
      prototype of the Motivational Interviewing Simulator: An Experiential Online Training Tool.&#xD;
      The interactive, case-based, multiplayer web-based game allows service providers to deepen&#xD;
      their skills in Motivational Interviewing (MI), a widely recognized evidence-based practice&#xD;
      that supports people to make positive behavior changes related to health, wellness, mental&#xD;
      illness, and addiction. Phase I study findings support the product's feasibility and the need&#xD;
      for a large-scale randomized trial to determine the tool's effectiveness. During Phase I,&#xD;
      participants in the Simulator group showed significant improvements in MI skills as measured&#xD;
      by Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) scores (34% improvement over&#xD;
      baseline) and Helpful Responses Questionnaire (HRQ) scores (13% improvement over&#xD;
      baseline)-both substantially higher than the rates of improvement for participants in the&#xD;
      control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project represents Phase II of the work to further develop the MI Simulator and to study&#xD;
      its impact on provider behavior and client outcomes. Phase II will create multiple &quot;play&#xD;
      arenas&quot;-Single Player, Two Player, and Advanced Free-play spaces-and multiple case-based&#xD;
      scenarios related to mental health, homelessness, addiction, and primary care. The&#xD;
      significantly expanded product will have wide appeal across a large workforce of providers&#xD;
      serving vulnerable populations, and it will support National Institute of Mental Health's&#xD;
      strategy of &quot;closing the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions&#xD;
      and their widespread use by those most in need.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II randomized controlled trial is guided by four specific aims. The first aim is to&#xD;
      diversify the prototype Motivational Interviewing Simulator to meet the needs of a wider&#xD;
      audience. Based on Phase I findings, we will build on the prototype by adding a Single Player&#xD;
      Arena, expanding the existing Two-Player Arena, and creating an Advanced Free-play Arena&#xD;
      where learners can go beyond basic MI skills. Additionally, the expanded product will include&#xD;
      multiple scenarios, story-lines, and characters for each arena, and multiple levels of play&#xD;
      for each scenario. The second aim is to evaluate the Simulator through a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. The third aim is to disseminate findings. And the fourth aim is to prepare&#xD;
      for commercialization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II seeks to answer a number of Research Questions that concern service providers,&#xD;
      clients, and organizations. Research questions pertaining to service providers are as&#xD;
      follows: What are the relative impacts of these interventions on providers' confidence,&#xD;
      knowledge and skills acquisition and retention? What supports are needed for providers to&#xD;
      adhere to the MI model with fidelity over time? And Does the impact of the treatment&#xD;
      condition vary by the amount of time the service provider spends engaged with the Sim or&#xD;
      eBook tools? One key research questions pertaining to clients is as follows: Do clients&#xD;
      served by providers receiving the Sim or eBook interventions show improved outcomes such as&#xD;
      housing stability and receptiveness to mental health treatment, medication adherence, greater&#xD;
      satisfaction with the provider, and greater confidence in individual treatment or recovery&#xD;
      plans, relative to the Training Only group? Two key research questions focusing on&#xD;
      organizations implementing MI are as follows: How does agency context influence provider&#xD;
      adherence to the MI model? And, What are the organizational-level barriers and facilitators&#xD;
      to successful MI implementation and fidelity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will test four hypotheses (H1, H2, H3, H4). H1 predicts that providers in the&#xD;
      Simulation condition will show the strongest knowledge and skill retention during the study&#xD;
      period when compared to MI Training Only and MI Training + eBook conditions. H2 predicts that&#xD;
      providers in the eBook condition will have stronger knowledge skill and retention over the&#xD;
      study period when compared to the MI Training Only Condition. H3 predicts that clients served&#xD;
      by providers in the Simulation condition will show greater improvements in housing stability&#xD;
      and receptiveness to mental health treatment, medication adherence, greater satisfaction with&#xD;
      the provider, and greater sense of confidence in individual treatment or recovery plans when&#xD;
      compared to clients of MI Training + eBook and MI Training Only conditions. H4 predicts that&#xD;
      clients served by providers in the Simulation condition will show improved communication with&#xD;
      their provider and greater sense of confidence in individual treatment or recovery plans&#xD;
      compared to those clients with providers in the MI training + eBook and MI Training Only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Motivational Interviewing Simulator: An Experiential Online Training Tool (the Sim) has&#xD;
      the potential to make a significant contribution to the fields of behavioral health, primary&#xD;
      care, adult learning, dissemination science, and beyond. Phase I of the project demonstrated&#xD;
      the feasibility of the product development effort and research approach. Phase II support&#xD;
      will allow the Center for Social Innovation (C4) to expand the depth and sophistication of&#xD;
      the product, evaluate its efficacy, and lay the groundwork for Phase III commercial roll-out.&#xD;
      Specifically, Phase II will add multiple arenas and levels to the prototype simulator,&#xD;
      allowing users to advance more deeply into Motivational Interviewing (MI) practice. The Phase&#xD;
      II product expansion will also create multiple story-lines, a variety of characters, and&#xD;
      expanded opportunities for feedback, features that will expand the product's marketability in&#xD;
      Phase III. As described below, the Sim has strong commercial potential and fits well into&#xD;
      C4's existing commercial training platform, the t3 (think. teach. transform.) learning&#xD;
      initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is valuable in various ways. Firstly, the SIM has the potential for improving the&#xD;
      lives of vulnerable people. The ultimate goal of this product is to improve the lives of&#xD;
      people who have experienced mental illness, addiction, homelessness, violence, and other&#xD;
      traumatic events. MI has been proven to have positive impact on clinical outcomes for these&#xD;
      marginalized groups. We believe that effective training of the workforce to use MI will&#xD;
      result in better care for people who would otherwise slip through the cracks of our systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the SIM has the potential to add value to the workforce. As C4 has expanded its&#xD;
      reach to thousands of direct service providers across the United States and internationally,&#xD;
      we have documented a lack of high-quality training opportunities for the behavioral health&#xD;
      workforce and a hunger for training on the part of agencies and individual&#xD;
      providers-particularly for MI. Much existing training is limited to onsite workshops,&#xD;
      conferences, and other face-to-face training. The online products that do exist do not&#xD;
      provide opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and have specific focuses (diabetes and&#xD;
      substance use) that do not include mental health. This product will provide an engaging,&#xD;
      highly interactive opportunity to learn a set of skills that many providers want to acquire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, the SIM has the potential to have an impact on dissemination science. If the Sim&#xD;
      proves to be a successful mode of learning, primarily as a &quot;booster shot&quot; following&#xD;
      face-to-face training, the implications for dissemination of evidence-based practices are&#xD;
      significant. We envision a family of learning simulation products built upon the architecture&#xD;
      developed for this project, covering a wide range of practices and skills-helping to close&#xD;
      the research- practice gap and move effective practices into the field more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcomes of this study include findings that document the product's&#xD;
      effectiveness. Expected research outcomes include improvements in provider knowledge and&#xD;
      skill, documentation of organizational strategies that support the uptake of best practices,&#xD;
      and improved outcomes for clients, including increased housing stability and greater&#xD;
      engagement in mental health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sim brings together a well-documented best practice, the need for ongoing provider&#xD;
      training, and cutting-edge simulation technology. Through widespread dissemination following&#xD;
      Phase II, the Sim has the potential to have tremendous impact, improving the skills of&#xD;
      service providers and the lives of the people they serve.&#xD;
