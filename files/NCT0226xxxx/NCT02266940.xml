    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomised, 3 treatment, 3 period crossover study. This study is&#xD;
      designed to assess the relative bioavailability of DS 1971a from a tablet formulation and a&#xD;
      reconstituted oral suspension and the effect of a high fat meal on the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of DS 1971a from the tablet formulation.&#xD;
