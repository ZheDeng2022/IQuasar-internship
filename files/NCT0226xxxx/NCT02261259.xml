  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop sensitive and objective clinical research&#xD;
      tools for the assessment of head-neck motor control. In order to accomplish this goal, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to quantify changes in head-neck motor control before and after osteopathic&#xD;
      manipulative treatment. The investigators hypothesize that head-neck motor control will&#xD;
      improve in neck pain participants after 4-weeks of treatment. Additionally, the investigators&#xD;
      will compare position and force head-neck motor control between healthy controls and neck&#xD;
      pain patients. The investigators hypothesize that baseline tests of position and force&#xD;
      head-neck motor control will be better in healthy individuals than neck pain patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline to week 4 and from week 4 to 8 in head position tracking accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4 and from week 4 to 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be seated in an upright position with their upper body secured to a backrest and will wear a head harness with an attached position sensor. The angular position of the head will be displayed on a monitor 1 meter in front of the participants and they will be asked to follow a moving target by moving their head. Accuracy will be determined by taking the difference between the target position signal and the actual head position (measured in degrees with string potentiometers).</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4 and from week 4 to 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be seated in an upright position with their upper body secured to a backrest and will be asked to generate force with their head against a fixed pad. The pad will be attached to a load cell that monitors how much force is being generated by their head. The force level will be displayed on a monitor 1 meter in front of the participants and they will be asked to follow a moving target by generating force with their head. Accuracy will be determined by taking the difference between target force signal and the actual head force (measured in Newtons with the load cell).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to week 4 and from week 4 to 8 in head position stabilization accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4 and from week 4 to 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be sitting upright in a seat mounted to a robotic platform (Mikrolar Hexapod Robot) with their upper body secured to a backrest and will wear a head harness with an attached position sensor. The robotic platform will provide an angular perturbation to the participant about the cervical spine in the sagittal plane while the participant is asked to maintain (stabilize) their head position in the upright posture. Accuracy will be determined by measuring the amount of head displacement (measured in degrees with string potentiometers) during the perturbation trial.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to week 4 in neck force and muscle activation directionality</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be seated in an upright position with their upper body secured to a backrest and will be asked to generate force with their head against a fixed pad. They will be asked to performed 6-seconds isometric exertions in different directions. Surface EMG will be recorded from the sternocliedomastoid, splenius capitis, and upper trapezius muscles. Muscle directionality will be determined by the EMG magnitude in each direction of exertion.</description>
