  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical manifestations of pulmonary embolism vary greatly from the absence of specific&#xD;
      clinical symptoms to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. Clinical form of EP represented by&#xD;
      &quot;lung superinfection&quot;, also called &quot;pulmonary embolism superinfected&quot; is common and&#xD;
      represents up to 30% of initial clinical presentations; she been few evaluations in clinical&#xD;
      research. The reality of the bacterial infection remains controversial and the clinical&#xD;
      presentation often leads to the prescription of empirical antibiotic therapy, often&#xD;
      unnecessary in many cases. Number of antibiotic prescriptions are probably inappropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fever has long been recognized as a sign associated with pulmonary embolism. Stein et al&#xD;
      reported a temperature above 37.5 ° C on 50% of patients with acute pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      without actually clarified whether this was related to temperature with a pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      or other associated cause. Murray et al estimated that greater than 38 ° C was explained by&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism in 57.1% of patients while in the PIOPED study, only 14% of patients had&#xD;
      fever with no other cause identified as pulmonary embolism. Fever due to pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      is often low intensity (often less than 38.3) and of short duration, with a peak on the day&#xD;
      of pulmonary embolism and a gradual decrease of about 1 week. The pathophysiology of fever in&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism has not yet was completely clarified. It is suggested that a combination&#xD;
      of several factors involved pyrogenic myocardial tissue necrosis and releasing&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, hemorrhage, vascular irritation or inflammation, atelectasis or&#xD;
      local superinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2004, the PCT has become a marker helping the initiation of antibiotic therapy in&#xD;
      patients with community-acquired pneumonia. This is especially verified in patients admitted&#xD;
      for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive bronchitis. In the latter case, the use of PCT&#xD;
      reduces inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Thus helping the clinician by measuring&#xD;
      biomarkers such as PCT is based on writing an algorithm leading or not to use antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of an algorithm involving the PCT could just as for infectious pneumonia or COPD, of&#xD;
      interest in the febrile pulmonary embolism to distinguish febrile forms related to bacterial&#xD;
      infections febrile forms of EP to other causes.&#xD;

      The investigators propose to realize a single-center prospective, randomized, parallel group,&#xD;
      to compare two groups of patients admitted with febrile pulmonary embolism . In the first&#xD;
      group of patients, the use of antibiotics will be guided by clinical (clinical group). In the&#xD;
      second group, the use of antibiotics will be guided by the algorithm (PCT group). The guided&#xD;
      by the PCT algorithm is only given aid the clinician in the therapeutic management without&#xD;
      its application only requires the doctor in charge of the patient. So if your doctor may&#xD;
      advocate (or deemed necessary) to continue (or start) antibiotics even if the PCT algorithm&#xD;
      would allow him to stop (or not initiate).&#xD;
