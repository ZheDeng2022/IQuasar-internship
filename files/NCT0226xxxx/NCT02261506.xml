  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacteremia is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in critically ill adults. Although&#xD;
      bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia) may arise from variable infectious foci (most&#xD;
      commonly central vascular catheter related, lung, urinary tract, intra-abdominal, or skin and&#xD;
      soft tissue sources), because of the high attendant morbidity and mortality of bacteremia,&#xD;
      these patients collectively represent a critically important group to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of the excessive antimicrobial use for individual patients, range from rash,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea, to anaphylaxis, neutropenia, renal failure, toxic&#xD;
      epidermal necrolysis, death, and a marked increase in ICU and hospital drug costs. One&#xD;
      particularly concerning complication, Clostridium difficile infection, has increased in&#xD;
      incidence and severity over the past decade. Much of this burden could be prevented through&#xD;
      reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another major consequence of excessive antibiotic use is antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance is not only a concern for the patient who receives antibiotics, but also for&#xD;
      neighbouring patients in the ICU, as well as future patients in the ICU and the hospital at&#xD;
      large - through patient-to-patient transmission, and environmental contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No previous randomized controlled trials have directly compared shorter versus longer&#xD;
      durations of antimicrobial treatment in these patients. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      multi-center randomized concealed allocation trial of shorter duration (7 days) versus longer&#xD;
      duration (14 days) antibiotic treatment for critically ill patients with bacteremia admitted&#xD;
      to ICU. Eligible, patients will be randomized to either 7 days or 14 days of adequate&#xD;
      antimicrobial treatment. The selection of type, dose and route of antibiotics will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physicians, but the duration of treatment (7 versus 14 days) will&#xD;
      be determined by randomization group. The randomization assignment will not be communicated&#xD;
      to the study research coordinator, study critical care or infectious diseases investigators&#xD;
      or clinicians until day 8. The primary outcome for the main trial will be 90-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be initiated at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Ontario, and&#xD;
      then rolled out to a second site at Kingston General Hospital in Kingston, Ontario. These&#xD;
      sites will be sufficient to meet the sample size goals for the pilot RCT, but if additional&#xD;
      funds are obtained the investigators will also roll out to the other Canadian ICUs listed&#xD;
      below. The goal of adding these additional sites will be to increase the generalizability of&#xD;
      the findings with respect to trial feasibility&#xD;
