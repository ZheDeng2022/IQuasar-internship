    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to be&#xD;
      conducted in two parts: the Dose Escalation Phase and the Dose Expansion Phase. The Dose&#xD;
      Escalation Phase will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2&#xD;
      dose(s) (RP2D) of PT-112 Injection and evaluate its safety and tolerability, and PK&#xD;
      (pharmacokinetics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dose Escalation Phase and is no longer enrolling. The Dose Expansion Phase currently has&#xD;
      two cohorts: one for the study of PT-112 in patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma, and&#xD;
      the second in the study of PT-112 in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition or disease: Advanced Solid Tumors; Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma; Metastatic&#xD;
      Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Intervention/treatment: Drug: PT-112 Injection&#xD;
