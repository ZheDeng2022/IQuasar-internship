      Study A536-06 is an open-label extension study for patients previously enrolled in study&#xD;
      A536-04 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01749540), to evaluate the safety,tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effects of up to 24 months of ACE-536 treatment in adult patients with&#xD;
      beta-thalassemia previously treated with ACE-536 for up to 3 months in study A536-04. The&#xD;
      starting dose level in A536-06 will be 0.8 mg/kg by subcutaneous (SC) injection once every 3&#xD;
      weeks. Dose titration/modification rules will be followed for individual patients and will be&#xD;
      based upon safety and efficacy data collected during the course of treatment.&#xD;
