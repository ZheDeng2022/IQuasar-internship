    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of patients treated with an high dose&#xD;
      radiation regimen using either stereotactic hypofractionated or normofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer and to establish efficacy (producing a&#xD;
      desired result or effect) and safety in this setting.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient found to be eligible to take part in this study, the patient will be assigned&#xD;
      to a study group based on the size of the lesion(s) and the discretion of the responsible&#xD;
      physician. Up to 71 patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is treated with standard radiotherapy, the patient will receive 25 fractions&#xD;
      of 2 Gy to the metastases, the treatment duration will be 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is treated with image-guided hypofractionated radiotherapy, the patient will&#xD;
      receive 3 fractions of 10 Gy to the metastases, the treatment duration will be 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Planning and Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all radiation treatments, the images that are taken during the treatment will be&#xD;
      closely analyzed after treatment is over. The patient will have 3 to 25 radiation treatments&#xD;
      per metastasis depending on the discretion of the responsible physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rest of the radiation treatment planning and treatment delivery appointments will be&#xD;
      unchanged. The dose given to the tumor and number of treatments the patient will receive,&#xD;
      will be determined by the discretion of the responsible physician, and is not affected by&#xD;
      taking part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the radiation treatment schedule ends, the patient will return for follow-up visits at&#xD;
      the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, every 3 months for 1 year, and then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 time a year after that, for as long as possible Additional follow up visits may be&#xD;
           scheduled, if the responsible physician thinks they are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any updates to the medical history of the patient will be recorded and the patient will&#xD;
           be asked about any side effects the patient may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient's performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient's complete symptom questionnaires will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will have a clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will have follow-up imaging (such as an MRI) to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study. Radiation therapy is delivered using CE-certified and&#xD;
      commercially available methods.&#xD;
