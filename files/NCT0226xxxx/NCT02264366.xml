    <textblock>
      The ACCELERATION (ACtivity, smoking Cessation, healthy Eating and aLcohol Education,&#xD;
      inteRvention, and motivATION) Program is a collaborative project in cancer and chronic&#xD;
      disease prevention that has been designed by and will be delivered amongst cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation and prevention programs and cancer centres in Ontario (ON), British Columbia&#xD;
      (BC), Quebec (QC) and Nova Scotia (NS). This project is being funded by the Canadian&#xD;
      Partnership Against Cancer, Health Canada and Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada and in&#xD;
      the amount of $2.4M over a 3 year period (October 2013 - September 2016). The ACCELERATION&#xD;
      Program is a 12 week structured model of behavioural interventions and education around&#xD;
      self-management and prevention that aims to access readily available and referable people for&#xD;
      primary prevention intervention.This program aligns with current provincial, national and&#xD;
      international chronic disease prevention and management strategies. The goal of the&#xD;
      ACCELERATION program is to measurably and effectively change the risk factors and health&#xD;
      behaviours known to impact cancer and other chronic diseases. Specifically we will aim to&#xD;
      increase physical activity, reduce smoking, encourage healthy eating, and moderate alcohol&#xD;
      consumption in about 3,000 participants across Canada over 3 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung conditions and diabetes are&#xD;
      the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in Canada and worldwide. These chronic&#xD;
      conditions share common modifiable risk factors including physical inactivity, suboptimal&#xD;
      nutrition, smoking and excessive alcohol intake. Cardiac rehabilitation centres in this&#xD;
      Coalition have been providing primary and secondary prevention services for many years&#xD;
      focused on these behavioural risks, and many of our participants with heart disease also have&#xD;
      co-morbidities including cancer, diabetes and lung disease. Co-morbidities are a clinical&#xD;
      reality, and we no longer deal with diseases singularly. Today, our client population is more&#xD;
      diverse than ever and fiscal constraints call for the pooling of prevention resources to&#xD;
      simultaneously address a range of chronic diseases impacted by common risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extending our reach to populations at risk of cancer and other chronic diseases, populations&#xD;
      which are readily available and referable In Ontario, UHN/Toronto Rehab has a cancer program&#xD;
      for women who have survived breast cancer as well as women undergoing cancer treatment.&#xD;
      Discussions with Princess Margaret Hospital point to opportunities to extend programming to&#xD;
      more cancer patients and people at risk of cancer. The ELLICSR arm of Princess Margaret&#xD;
      Hospital, which focuses on helping survivors, has expressed interest in collaborating to&#xD;
      reach family and friends of cancer survivors, for primary prevention. Likewise, the Odette&#xD;
      Cancer Centre at Sunnybrook Hospital sees over 900 new women every year who are referred due&#xD;
      to a family history of breast cancer. They have expressed to us that they can identify and&#xD;
      will refer women at high risk of developing breast cancer into our proposed primary&#xD;
      prevention program. Similarly, in Quebec, L'Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal has one of the&#xD;
      nation's highest rated lung cancer groups. Our Quebec partner, Centre de réadaptation&#xD;
      cardio-respiratoire Jean-Jacques-Gauthier (CRJJG) has strong ties to this program. With&#xD;
      funding, they will be able to reach and deliver prevention programmes to the family and&#xD;
      friends of their lung cancer clients, an opportunity that exists because family and friends&#xD;
      tend to be more engaged and open to the possibility of lifestyle change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is why we have partnered with these cancer centres in this Coalition: to formalize our&#xD;
      existing partnerships and focus our resources on the population at risk of cancer that is&#xD;
      readily available and referable for primary prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The links that our Coalition partners have with primary care hold opportunities not yet&#xD;
      seized. In Ontario, the Department of Family and Community Medicine at Sunnybrook has many&#xD;
      patients at risk for, or with, multiple chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The opportunity that exists to reach pregnant women with obesity-related risks is one that&#xD;
      could be seized Canada-wide. The unfortunate reality is that obesity complicates about 50% of&#xD;
      pregnancies today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The opportunity, and need, to impact a person's family and social circle Our program concept&#xD;
      is founded on the idea that 'you really need to get the whole family' to sustain the&#xD;
      long-term impact of prevention and change in behaviour. We know there is evidence that&#xD;
      family/social support can help. A systematic review on childhood obesity identified promising&#xD;
      strategies that included parent support and home activities that encourage children to be&#xD;
      more active, eat more nutritious foods and spend less time in screen-based activities (Waters&#xD;
      et al, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As Lead Agency, the UHN/Toronto Rehab already runs a successful Cardiac Rehab @ Home program&#xD;
      which is a six-month program that sees approximately 120 clients per year. The average client&#xD;
      lives approximately 200kms away from the urban area, is younger, and more likely to be&#xD;
      working, compared to on-site clients. An evaluation has shown that the program is effective&#xD;
      with similar outcomes as an on-site program: clients made the same gains in cardiovascular&#xD;
      fitness and were just as likely to adhere to the program. The study also showed that such&#xD;
      programs are more cost-effective than on-site programs for participants living in remote&#xD;
      areas (Scane et al, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deepening and broadening our reach to selected at risk populations already connected to us.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the core partners not only have links to their local communities but have years of&#xD;
      collaboration with the community on prevention. Notably, our BC partner, the BC&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Physiology &amp; Rehabilitation Laboratory, has extensive primary prevention&#xD;
      experience having worked with more than 300,000 participants in the past 10 years on&#xD;
      community-based programs for children (school-based and out-of-school), workplace wellness&#xD;
      (e.g. police and firefighters) and population groups at risk for chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, they have solid partnerships with Aboriginal communities throughout BC. Formal&#xD;
      partnerships have been forged with Aboriginal communities throughout BC including extensive&#xD;
      research in rural and remote communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the Coalition's work and history with the Aboriginal communities, and because they&#xD;
      know there is evidence that there are health benefits for Aboriginal peoples in participating&#xD;
      in a community-based physical activity intervention , the ACCELERATION program could be&#xD;
      delivered with relative ease to these communities in BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Centre de réadaptation cardio-respiratoire Jean-Jacques-Gauthier (CRJJG) provides&#xD;
      prevention programming for patients with cardiovascular (heart disease and heart failure) and&#xD;
      respiratory disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma). One very unique&#xD;
      aspect is the ongoing asthma prevention work of this coalition member. This adult asthma&#xD;
      population are, on average, younger than most classical rehabilitation groups (ca. 40 years&#xD;
      old) and, whilst not having overt cancer or cardiovascular disease, do normally display&#xD;
      several risk factors, which provides a model of engaging and adapting the ACCELERATION&#xD;
      program to these kinds of populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the CRJJG is conveniently housed within the YMCA Cartierville. There is,&#xD;
      therefore, already a strong partnership with the YMCA. The proposed program will allow our&#xD;
      Quebec partner to deliver a prevention program to YMCA users with risk factors or a family&#xD;
      history of chronic diseases. In addition, the YMCA Cartierville has a unique partnership with&#xD;
      the local council where it provides free access to non-YMCA local community members, thus&#xD;
      allowing the ACCELERATION programme to be delivered to a very diverse cultural and&#xD;
      socio-economic community base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the CRJJG has specific expertise in motivational interviewing (MI) , which is a&#xD;
      client-centred communication tool focusing on enhancing intrinsic motivation to change a&#xD;
      particular behaviour, and exploring and resolving ambivalence about behavior change (Lavoie&#xD;
      et al, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Eastern end of Canada, the province of Nova Scotia has one of the highest rates of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in the country with a prevalence of 6.4% (Heart and Stroke Foundation,&#xD;
      2012). There is also an excess incidence and prevalence of lung, colorectal, prostate,&#xD;
      melanoma and breast cancer (Canadian Cancer Society). This is one reason we chose to partner&#xD;
      with Nova Scotia. Our partner runs the Community Cardiovascular Hearts in Motion (CCHIM)&#xD;
      program which is a community-based exercise and health education program. Referrals are&#xD;
      accepted from predominantly family doctors but also other specialists and allied health&#xD;
      professionals including physiotherapists, nurse practitioners and diabetes clinics. Patients&#xD;
      expand the complete vascular spectrum from primary care to all levels of secondary&#xD;
      prevention. There is also a Heart Health Clinic available to assist those individuals living&#xD;
      with more complicated and higher risk cardiac and pulmonary disease (tertiary). The successes&#xD;
      of this program are translatable to the ACCELERATION program that targets people at risk of&#xD;
      cancer and chronic diseases, as well as family and friends of people who have suffered an&#xD;
      acute event associated with a chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Nova Scotia partner notes that there is strong representation of females in the primary&#xD;
      prevention arm of CCHIM and most of these are obese with diabetes. The planned Ontario&#xD;
      program with ante- and post-partum women at risk of obesity-related cancer is replicable for&#xD;
      the Nova Scotia female population, and we would seek to transfer knowledge and replicate the&#xD;
      program in Nova Scotia as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also an opportunity to reach the underserviced black population. Incidence rate&#xD;
      ratios for African Canadians relative to the general population of Nova Scotia were&#xD;
      significantly elevated for circulatory disease, diabetes and psychiatric disorders (Kisely et&#xD;
      al, 2008). Our Nova Scotia partner (CCHIM) sees opportunity in providing a virtual program&#xD;
      for this population. CCHIM is in present development of translational research to move beyond&#xD;
      the &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; to reach such patient populations who are in need of such a program&#xD;
      by virtue of risk or established disease but cannot, or will not, attend. This will be run&#xD;
      through the primary care physician and local health care teams (such as NP clinics, addiction&#xD;
      services, etc). It will allow for adaptation and implementation when the patient is &quot;ready&quot;&#xD;
      to engage (similar to smoking cessation as per the &quot;Ottawa Model&quot;). This approach will be&#xD;
      adapted to the present project in an effort to expand its exposure further while evaluating&#xD;
      the elements that are sustainable upon project completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Ontario, the South Asian population is the largest visible minority group in Ontario, and&#xD;
      one with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases compared to other groups (Statistics Canada,&#xD;
      2010; Fraser Health, 2013). They would benefit from a targeted program like ACCELERATION that&#xD;
      is customized for them, and made culturally appropriate to their beliefs, values and customs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deepening prevention impact in workplaces Two of our key partners (BC and NS) have existing&#xD;
      partnerships with large employers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In BC, our partner has a formal research relationship with the City of Richmond. They&#xD;
      evaluate the risk for chronic disease in approximately 200-300 City of Richmond workers each&#xD;
      year. The proposed program will allow the introduction of a workplace wellness program for&#xD;
      these workers. We estimate that with the awarding of this program that the current workplace&#xD;
      wellness program will expand meeting the needs of family and friends of city workers meeting&#xD;
      a direct mandate of the City of Richmond employers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Nova Scotia partner will engage their Capital District Health Authority (CDHA) workplace,&#xD;
      drawing participants from a population of 10,000 employees. Having both a set program and a&#xD;
      virtualization of the program will offer a unique opportunity to address both the benefits to&#xD;
      at risk patients as well as the application of a program to the most common yet possibly the&#xD;
      most difficult workplace sector to access.&#xD;
