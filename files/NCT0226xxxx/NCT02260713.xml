  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study on 7 subjects in each group (total 21 subjects) to establish the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of autologous bone marrow cell transplantation in case of acute complete spinal&#xD;
      cord injury by each of the following techniques and a corresponding number of controlled&#xD;
      subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Directly into the injured site with a syringe after exposing the spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By Intrathecal injection.&#xD;

      Intervention : Autologous bone marrow cell: Transplantation of the autologous bone marrow&#xD;
      cell transplantation through one of the below mentioned techniques: 1. Directly into the&#xD;
      injured spinal cord site with a syringe after exposing the spinal cord. 2. By Intrathecal&#xD;
      injection. Number of cells Injected: 200 million cells in 1.8 ml of autologous plasma. In&#xD;
      case of Direct delivery, the cells were delivered in one sitting at six sites ( 2 above the&#xD;
      lesion, 2 at the lesion and 2 below the lesion) as 0.3 ml aliquots each. In case of&#xD;
      Intrathecal injection, the cells were delivered as a single injection of 1.8ml via lumbar&#xD;
      puncture. Frequency of Injection: Single Total duration of Therapy: The procedure of Bone&#xD;
      marrow harvesting, enrichment and transplantation was completed in a single setting of&#xD;
      approximately 2-3 hours. The transplantation procedure in case of Direct delivery took 2 mins&#xD;
      per injection site that is approximately 12 mins and in case of lumbar puncture the&#xD;
      transplantation procedure took approximately 2 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator Agent:Control: control subjects with acute complete spinal cord injury who would&#xD;
      not receive any bone marrow transplantation.&#xD;
