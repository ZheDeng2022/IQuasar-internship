  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal injuries resulting in pain are one of the most common reasons for disability&#xD;
      and missed duty among military personnel. Additionally, these injuries may create impairment&#xD;
      in the area of optimal function, sleep and mood that may not be completely resolved with&#xD;
      currently available therapies. This scenario creates the setting for testing and&#xD;
      incorporation of additional treatment options to potentially improve care outcomes. Recent&#xD;
      investigations have examined the adjunctive use of auricular therapy, which utilizes various&#xD;
      interventions, typically needle-based, to stimulate the ear. This intervention appears to&#xD;
      modulate the autonomic nervous system to produce more rapid onset of pain relief and&#xD;
      reduction in pain related co-morbidities. For this trial of adjunctive auricular therapy,&#xD;
      active duty personnel presenting with an acute or sub-acute musculoskeletal injury triaged to&#xD;
      outpatient care for treatment will be studied. Subjects randomized to auricular treatment&#xD;
      will receive, in addition to standard care, up to 12 treatments over a maximum of 3 months&#xD;
      from a clinician trained in auricular therapy. This trial will specifically examine whether&#xD;
      the addition of a specific auricular therapy protocol to standard care will have a beneficial&#xD;
      impact on the pain and functionality of military personnel who sustain an acute or sub-acute&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injury.&#xD;
