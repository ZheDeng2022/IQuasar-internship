      This pilot clinical trial studies the Harvesting Health Program in improving the diet and&#xD;
      physical activity level of cancer survivors. Nutrition and physical activity classes and the&#xD;
      opportunity to harvest fruits, vegetables, and herbs may increase participants' fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable consumption and physical activity levels. Studying the participation rates and&#xD;
      changes in participants' eating and physical activity habits may help doctors learn whether&#xD;
      the program has an effect on participant lifestyle.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure survivor participation in regards to each aspect of the Harvesting Health Program&#xD;
      (personalized and group education, gardening and harvesting, and utilization of novel&#xD;
      web-based technologies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess survivor preferences regarding key Harvesting Health Program components impacting&#xD;
      participation (physical facilities, schedule and timing, education topics and sessions,&#xD;
      garden access, web portal usability, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. A customized &quot;Nutrition &amp; Physical Activity Scorecard&quot; has been developed and will be&#xD;
      implemented to evaluate pre/post measures of diet and physical activity at baseline (month 0)&#xD;
      and at months 6, 9 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Participants are evaluated at baseline and at completion of the intervention for: (a)&#xD;
      serum and body composition biomarkers of exposure and efficacy, and (b) health indices&#xD;
      related to cancer survivorship and overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess Program sustainability, follow-up questionnaires will be completed at 9 and 12&#xD;
      months using the Nutrition &amp; Physical Activity Scorecard and questionnaires regarding quality&#xD;
      of life outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo a series of 10 education and training sessions over 1 hour every 2&#xD;
      weeks, comprising education on current research, evidence-based health guidelines,&#xD;
      application techniques, reference materials specific to extended-stage cancer survivors, and&#xD;
      recommendations and personal health goals for survivorship.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in behavior, measured by Nutrition &amp; Physical Activity Scorecards</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The hypothesis of no change in the overall scorecard value will be tested versus a two sided alternative using a paired T-test at alpha level 0.025 (Bonferroni corrected for 2 scorecards). Exploratory analyses may be completed to understand which components of these Scorecards are driving the improvement or degradation in scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in biomarker levels, assessed by values for the Health &amp; Wellness Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Biomarkers include blood glucose, lipid panel (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides), skin antioxidant score and bone density. The hypothesis of no change in these markers will be tested using a multivariate Hotelling's T-squared test at the 0.05 level. If a significant difference is noted, then the individual scores will be further tested with paired t-tests to determine which are significantly different. The p-values of the individual t-tests will be adjusted via a Bonferroni correction.</description>
