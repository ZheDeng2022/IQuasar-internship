      Background: The prevalence of both senile cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and aortic stenosis (AS)&#xD;
      markedly increases with age. Aortic stenosis increases left ventricular pressure overload.&#xD;
      Cardiac deposits have been observed in AS and the amount of these deposits has been&#xD;
      correlated to post-surgical outcome. As they are strong echocardiographic and cardiac MRI&#xD;
      imaging similarities between CA and AS, the investigators hypothesized that the deposit&#xD;
      observed in AS is transthyretin amyloid deposit. The investigators objective is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that amyloid deposit is associated with poor outcomes following aortic stenosis&#xD;
      surgical valve replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materiel and methods: 180 patients with indication for surgical aortic valve replacement will&#xD;
      be recruited prospectively and consecutively in 5 French centers. A replicative study will be&#xD;
      performed in one Austrian center. Echocardiography, cardiac MRI and bone scintigraphy will be&#xD;
      performed prior to surgery. During surgery, a basal LV septum biopsy will be collected for&#xD;
      determination and quantification of interstitial deposits using specific staining which will&#xD;
      be performed in a blind fashion. Clinical outcomes will be recorded during the&#xD;
      hospitalization period following the surgery and at 1 year. Alive and re-hospitalization&#xD;
      status will be determined. Patients will be classified according to the presence or not of&#xD;
      amyloid deposits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and impact: This study will emphasize how pressure overload stress&#xD;
      accelerates and magnifies amyloid deposition usually known to be related to cardiac aging&#xD;
      process. It will develop reliable imaging tools and markers to detect cardiac amyloid&#xD;
      deposition. Correlation between anatomopathologic analyses and the three different imaging&#xD;
      technics will identify accurate imaging markers of CA. A risk stratification model based on&#xD;
      amyloid deposits level for the clinical management of these patients will be created&#xD;
      combining imaging and biological markers.&#xD;

      Cardiovascular diseases remain the major cause of mortality and morbidity in industrialised&#xD;
      countries. Their prevalence increases steeply as consequence of the aging of the population&#xD;
      in these countries. Curiously, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases share common&#xD;
      aging pathological pathways involving abnormal accumulation of insoluble amyloid proteins in&#xD;
      the extracellular matrix disrupting normal organ function. Whereas neurological amyloid&#xD;
      diseases has been considerably investigated, little attention has been paid to the&#xD;
      aggregation of amyloid proteins in cardiovascular diseases. Post-mortem studies have&#xD;
      identified cardiac wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis deposition in 25% of individuals over&#xD;
      the age of 80 years leading to the concept of &quot;senile cardiac amyloidosis&quot; (CA) (Cornwell, Am&#xD;
      j Med 1984; Pitkanen, Am J Pathol 1984). The cause of this deposition is not yet known but&#xD;
      might be related primarily to aging process and enhanced by cardiac mechanical stress&#xD;
      (overload), hypoxia, oxidative stress and inflammation. Since patients with transthyretin CA&#xD;
      develop severe heart failure with poor prognosis, it is crucial to identify them especially&#xD;
      among population at risk such those with aortic stenosis (AS). Indeed this common valvular&#xD;
      heart disease affects mainly senescent subjects and combines so the adverse effects on&#xD;
      myocardial function of both pressure overload and myocardial aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, some elderly patients with severe AS exhibit similar echocardiographic and&#xD;
      cardiac MRI patterns as those reported in CA including increased cardiac wall thickness and&#xD;
      progressive left ventricular dysfunction starting with alteration of basal LV-2D strain. They&#xD;
      also exhibit increased late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) at cardiac MRI. This has been&#xD;
      interpreted as related to interstitial myocardial &quot;fibrosis&quot; and has been correlated with&#xD;
      poor prognosis after aortic valve replacement i.e.; high mortality, persistence of heart&#xD;
      failure symptoms and LV dysfunction (Weidemann Circ 2009; Dweck, JACC 2011; Hermann JACC&#xD;
      2011). However none of these patients have benefited from a detailed histology analysis with&#xD;
      aiming at identifying amyloid deposits. The investigators have recently found similar&#xD;
      clinical observations in the investigators AS cohort. Using specific staining, the&#xD;
      investigators were able to unmask the association of severe AS and CA in these patients.&#xD;
      These preliminary findings raise the question of a potential pathophysiological link between&#xD;
      CA and AS and might explain why some patients with AS may not benefit from cardiac surgery.&#xD;
