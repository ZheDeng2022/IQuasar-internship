  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the association between sodium and TH17 cells&#xD;
      in human subjects. The subjects will have levels of TH-17 and various hormones measured on&#xD;
      low salt diet, low salt diet with intravenous normal saline, and high salt diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, dietary sodium intake has dramatically increased and has been shown to play&#xD;
      an active role in a number of detrimental diseases including hypertension and cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications. Additionally, in the developed world, there has been a steady increase in&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases. Type 17 helper T cells (Th17) have been shown to play an active role in&#xD;
      the development of autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum glucocorticoid kinase (SGK1) has been shown to influence sodium transport and salt&#xD;
      homeostasis in many cell types (Wulf, J. Clin. Invest. 2002; Salker, Nature Med 2011). Prior&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that an increase in salt concentration in the media&#xD;
      or dietary salt intake in mice induces SGK1 expression and enhances TH17 cell differentiation&#xD;
      and worsens experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), animal model for multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (Kleinewietfeld, Nature 2013; Wu, Nature 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings in this study can substantially increase the investigators understanding of&#xD;
      environmental factors that modulate the development of autoimmunity in humans. In animal&#xD;
      models the worsening effects of a high salt diet on EAE are dramatic. To the investigators&#xD;
      knowledge, the proposed study will be the first to determine if salt intake has the same&#xD;
      adverse impact in humans. If documented, one could envision the development of a novel&#xD;
      treatment approach for human autoimmunity via the regulation of salt intake. Thus, the&#xD;
      overall goal of this study is to evaluate the association between sodium and TH17 cells in&#xD;
      human subjects. In addition to measuring TH17 cells by flow cytometry the investigators will&#xD;
      also measure interleukins such as IL-17a, IL-17f, IL-23 that are important in TH17&#xD;
      differentiation and production.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will seek normal, healthy volunteers age 18-45 years. Participants must be healthy,&#xD;
